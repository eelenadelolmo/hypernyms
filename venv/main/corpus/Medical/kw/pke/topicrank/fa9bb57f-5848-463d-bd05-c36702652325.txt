The patient had an elevated white count.
No treatment was required for the asymptomatic aberrant right subclavian artery.  The patient was treated with antibiotics for his pneumonia with the recommendation for followup imaging to document resolution.
The patient's PA/LAT chest radiograph revealed widening of the superior mediastinum.  On lateral view there is a soft tissue density in the superior middle mediastinum with mass effect on the posterior trachea.

CT, PE/DVT showed an incidental finding of an aberrant right subclavian artery.  The artery is seen passing posterior to the esophagus from left to right.  The patients symptoms likely resulted from a left lung base pneumonia also seen on the CT.
