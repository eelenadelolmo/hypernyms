• Enlarged optic nerve/nerve sheath complex on left.
• Enhancement of optic nerve sheath best seen on fat suppressed images--"Tram Track" sign
• Loss of CSF signal in nerve sheath due compression by tumor
• Loss of target sign on coronal T2 sequences through orbit due to compression of nerve and increased T2 signal of nerve.
