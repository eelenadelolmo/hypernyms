Notable only for 3x3.5cm firm nodule in level 2 region.  Nasopharyngoscope exam was benign.
This patient has T2N2aM0 or Stage IVa disease.  Surgical excision or combined chemoradiation are the accepted treatment options.  Given liklihood of severe morbidity post-surgery, patient chose chemoradiation.  However, left neck dissection is still a possibility.  Patient will have IMRT M-F for about 8 weeks and opted for amifostine for parotid sparing.  Patient will have lifetime follow-up to monitor for recurrent and new primary disease.
Neck CT: Mass adjacent to left parotid and medial to digastric measuring 2.8 (AP)x 1.6 (trans)x 4.5cm(cc).  Soft tissue asymmetry superior to left vallecula - mass cannot be excluded.

Neck MRI: Enhancing plaque-like mass measuring 0.9 x 2.2 x 3.4 cm at base of the tongue.  A second enhancing mucosal plaque-like lesion at same level of tongue base to the right of midline measuring 1.5cm (trans) x 2.9cm (CC) x 6mm thick.  Masses do not appear to extend into musculature of tongue.  Hemorrhagic and necrotic lymph node in level 1 left side just inferior to mandible and deep portion of parotid lateral to carotids measuring 3 x 1.8 x 3.8cm.  Second necrotic node above previous measuring 1.1 x 1.3 x 1.6cm.
oropharyngeal (tongue) cancer, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)

HPI: Presented with a 6 month hisotry of an asymptomatic left neck mass s/p failed course of abx therapy and two non-diagnostic FNAs.

PMH: Denies any h/o CA, XRT, chemo.  Denies any h/o heart dz, lung dz, DM, SLE, scleroderma, or IBD.

PSH: T&A at 6; BTL at 41; Right foot surgery at 51.

FHX: mom h/o uterine and colon CA; 3 sisters h/o breast CA; sister h/o uterine CA; sister h/o breast and kidney CA, died at 52; brother died of lung CA at 52

Allergies: NKDA

Meds: Tylenol

SHx: G4P4, postmenopausal; lifetime non-smoker, non-drinker; no significant travel or occupational exposure history

ROS: Pos for globus sensation.  Denies weight loss, pain, hoarseness, dysphagia, constitutional symptoms.
This patient is unique given a lack of any classic risk factors for oropharyngeal cancer.  However, her extensive family history of cancer raises the question of a familial risk factor.  Although oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is not classically related to any of the other cancers her mother and siblings sufferred from, the same overexpression or underexpression of cell cycle regulators and tumor suppressors implicated in the pathogenesis of those cancers are being studied as playing a role in oropharyngeal carcinogenesis as well.
