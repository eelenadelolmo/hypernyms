-coarse, reticulonodular opacities
-linear opacities
-peribronchial cuffing
-concomitant hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement (occasionally)
-normal chest x-ray

CT:
-thickened interlobular septa and subpleural interstitium that does not distort the pulmonary lobule
-nodular thickening of the septa
-effusion

-interstial fibrosis from any number of causes

50 yo male w/ a h/o metastatic gastric cancer.
This case shows many of the classic findings associated w/ lymphangitic carcinomatosis.  With a h/o metastatic gastric cancer, increased interstitial thickening and pleural effusions on CXR, and nodular thickening of the septa and effusions on CT, these findings are consistent with lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
