Deformity of right hip.
This was not why the patient was admitted.  SHe has had progressive deformity of the right hip and uses crutches to ambulate.
Single AP view of the pelvis demonstrates a deformed right iliac bone with lucent appearing lesions with sclerotic margins.  The pelvic wall is medially displaced.  The sacrum is also involved, but is difficult to visualize.   An axial CT through the pelvis demonstrates a deformed region of bone with a honeycomb trabecular appearance.

Fibrous Dysplasia.
29 year old female admitted for abdominal pain.
This patient was diagnosed with hemangiomatosis (cystic angiomatosis) of the right hip at age two by incisional biopsy, found after rather innocuous trauma.  The patient has had progressive deformity of the hip and can only ambulate with the aid of crutches.

Hemangiomatosis is characterized by wide spread cystic lesions of bones and may involve other organs, including the soft tissues, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen and others.  Visceral involvement occurs in 60-70% of cases.  The most common osseous structures involved are the femur, ribs, vertebral bodies, skull, and innominante bone (as in our patient).

In the long bones, they may occur anywhere, but tend to involve the medually canal, but may be cortically based.  On plain radiograph, they are characterized b well defined round or ovoid osteolyic lesions of varying sizes.  Usually a sclerotic rim is present.  CT will usually demonstrate a “honeycoming” of the affected bones.

EG and brown tumors may have this appears, but the sclerotic margins are not typical of these lesions.  Fibrous dysplasia can, on occasion, give a similar appearance.  However, pathology will differentiate
