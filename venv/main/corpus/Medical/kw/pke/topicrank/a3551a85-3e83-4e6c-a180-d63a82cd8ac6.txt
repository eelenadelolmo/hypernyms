PE revealed a 5 feet 8 inches tall woman  weighing 368 lbs. She was alert and oriented with a pleasant demeanor. All vital signs were stable and within normal limits. Bilateral lower extremity 1+ edema was noted. Deep tendon reflexes in the patellar, Achilles tendons and upper extremities were 2+. The patient adequately performed toe-walk and heel-walk, and could squat with mild pain to 135 degrees. Physical performance revealed increased back pain upon left lateral bending, flexion, and extension radiating down her right leg to the ankle. Right lateral bending elicited milder back pain radiating down the right leg to the ankle. Straight leg raise test was performed, and passive elevation of the left leg was accomplished to 61 degrees, whereas the right leg was raised to only 49 degrees with significant pain. Algometry indicated hyperalgesia in the left and right paraspinals two and four finger widths, respectively, from midline at L4. EMG studies were conducted, and the tibialis anterior muscle registered numerous fibrillations (FIB) and positive Sharp waves (PSW), which are hallmarks of S1 radiculopathy (figures 1+2).   An acute L5 radiculopathy was noted.
Laminotomy and resection of the facet joint cyst was scheduled with subsequent chiropractic, neurosurgery, and primary care physician follow-up. Prognosis is excellent given that there are no other significant lesions present that could account for the extreme L5/S1 nerve root impingement that this patient suffers from.

The patient received Flexion-Distraction decompressive therapy to the lower back.  Such did help ameliorate her pain.  However, the findings of radiculopathy remain at this point for the right lower extremity.  As such she has been scheduled for neurosurgery for the lumbar spine.
No annular bulges are present at T12-L1, L1-l2, or L2-L3. Mild disc bulge and dessication was evident at L3-L4 (T1 with contrast, T2 without contrast; figures 3+4). Bilateral facet arthropathy is seen at L4-L5, as well as disc dessication (figures 5+6). At the right L4-L5 facet joint, a 1.8 x 1.2 cm lesion within the right spinal canal is found (figure 7). This lesion extends inferiorly and compresses the right L5 and S1 nerve roots. Based on its anatomical location, signal on T2 weighted MR imaging, and the fact that it is not contrast enhancing, this is a large facet joint. Signal from this lesion is hypointense relative to the intervertebral disc on T1-weighted imaging, indicating it is not an incarcerated herniated disc (figure 8). No other significant lesions are present at the inferior adjacent vertebral level (L5-S1) that could account for the symptoms and exam findings of this patient (figure 9+10).
Facet Joint (synovial) Cyst
The patient’s complaints and PE findings are consistent with radiculopathy of the right L5-S1 nerve roots, and imaging revealed a dorsolateral extradural mass of the spinal canal. The differential diagnosis for this includes bulging/protruding intervertebral disc, perineural cyst, arachnoid cyst, neurofibroma with cystic degeneration, and primary or secondary neoplasm (1). All of these could potentially exert mass effect on the L5/S1 nerve roots and cause the severe radiculopathy evident in this patient. 
From imaging studies and history, it was apparent that this was a facet joint cyst and the other lesions on the original differential could be excluded. The lesion was 1.8 x 1.2 cm, and was found at the L4-L5 right facet which had evidence of arthropathy, and joint damage is thought to be the initiating factor in facet joint cyst development. Rationale for this is discussed in the section below.
A 49 y.o. woman complains of persistent lower back pain starting five months earlier, following a work-related fall on ice. A later exacerbation worsened this condition when the school bus she works on hit an object in the road and the resulting jarring of the vehicle caused instant pain. The pain originally remained bilaterally in her lower back, but has since progressed to include her buttocks bilaterally, and now radiates down her right leg to her ankle and has associated paresthesia and muscle weakness, often with a “tingly and crampy” pain in her leg muscles. These symptoms are constant, awaken her at night, are a 10/10 on self-reported pain scale, and aggravated by standing and heat. Symptoms are alleviated by sitting and lying in the prone position. The patient is currently unable to perform her duties as a bus monitor and is not working. 
PMH/PSurgH/SH: 
The patient’s history is significant for CHF (diagnosed December 2013), GERD, and obesity treated with gastric bypass surgery in August 2004. Other procedures include dilation and curettage in 1985, and tonsillectomy in 2001. In addition to hospitalization for these procedures, she was hospitalized for pneumonia in March 2013 and peripheral edema in 2014. She denies smoking, EtOH, and illicit drug abuse. She has NKDA. She currently takes Lortab 10mg/325mg tid, which brings her pain to 4/10. For CHF she currently takes metoprolol, losartan, and amlodipine.

Imaging studies revealed a 1.8 x 1.2 cm mass arising from the right L4-L5 facet joint. This lesion was fluid filled as evidenced by hyperintense signal on T2-weight MR imaging, and this is consistent with the signal expected from synovial fluid.  

L4-L5 is the most common location for facet joint cysts (1). The signal of the fluid was not uniform, which is common with facet joint cysts due to calcification or presence of gas (2). 
Disc dessication and bulging at L4-L5 was noted in this patient, but it was mild and not expected to cause radiculopathy. Additionally, the cyst did not appear to communicate with this disc. Moreover, its signal did not match that of the L4-L5 disc. The signal of the cyst interior was hyperintense relative to the disc on T2 weighted imaging, indicating high fluid content (figure 8). These findings ruled out herniated disc, even of the sequestered variety. 

Neurofibroma with cystic degeneration was also not likely. These lesions are associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, which our patient did not suffer from, and are most commonly found in the cervical spine (3). These lesions contain fluid, but arise from a benign transformation of cells of peripheral nerve sheaths. The lesion in this patient had no association with peripheral nerve, but instead, of the facet joint. Moreover these lesions are often multiple, and exhibit heterogeneous contrast enhancement on MR imaging. Our patient’s solitary lesion did not enhance with contrast and had no significant cellular component (figure 8). Central hypointensity on T2-weighted imaging, a “target sign”, due to collagenous material at the center of neurofibromas is also not present in our patient’s imaging studies (4).

Primary or secondary neoplasm was unlikely in this patient. The high vascularity due to the aggressive growth rate of neoplasms would likely render this lesion contrast enhancing. Additionally a greater degree of cellularity would be expected. Neoplasms would be expected to be highly positive on PET scan due to their high metabolic rate, and this modality could be utilized but was deemed unnecessary.   

The remaining possible diagnoses are perineural cyst, arachnoid cyst, and facet joint cyst. Perineural, or Tarlov cysts, occur solely in the sacral region of the spine, and can be extra-dural or intra-dural (5). These cysts are often numerous, originate from the dorsal root, with which our patient’s lesion did not communicate. The signal of the fluid in these cysts is identical to CSF on T1 and T2 MR imaging, and the fluid is not generated de novo by cells lining the interior of the cysts, unlike facet joint cysts whose synovium generates fluid. The pathognomonic histological finding of perineural cysts is nerve fibers in their walls. Perineural cysts also are associated with connective tissue disorders which our patient does not have (6).

Arachnoid cysts, like perineural cysts, acquire their fluid from the CSF and this therefore exhibits signal identical to this on MRI (7). These two cysts are very difficult to distinguish from one another (8). These cysts do not enhance with contrast on MRI, and the majority are found in the thoracic spine, not the lumbar region. The inhomogenous fluid signal in our patient’s lesion and its anatomical position do not coincide with an arachnoid cyst. 

From its anatomical location at L4-L5, its association with a facet joint with obvious degenerative changes, its non-contrast-enhancing character, and the signal of the fluid at its interior on T2-weighted imaging, this case is a textbook example of a severely symptomatic facet joint cyst. Only histopathological studies revealing synovial cells lining the interior, macrophages, and micro-calcifications could further support this diagnosis but were not deemed necessary prior to treatment (1). This would irrefutably differentiate this facet joint cyst from perineural or arachnoid cysts. 

Our patient is an excellent case illustrating a symptomatic facet joint cyst resulting in severe symptomatology. Although rarely symptomatic, facet joint cysts can cause severe morbidity and disability. Utilization of MRI is essential in their proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
