Abdominal distension, elevated circulating estrogens
•	Surgical resection as possible- many lesions will be surgically unresectable or inaccessible such as at the mesenteric root 
•	Surgical v. chemical castration (GNRH analogues)
•	Aromatase inhibitors (Anastrozole)
•	Goal- symptomatic improvement
•	Metastatic degeneration to sarcoma- only 2-3 case reports in literature
Sagittal T-2 weighted and axial T-2 weighted with fat suppression MR images of the pelvis demonstrate multiple subserosal and intramural uterine fibroids with too numerous to count intraperitoneal masses of similar homogenous hypointensity
