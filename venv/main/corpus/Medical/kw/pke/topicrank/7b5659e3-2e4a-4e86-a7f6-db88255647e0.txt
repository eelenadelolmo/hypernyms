Right sided weakness
Acute stroke in left basal ganglia.
Associated dystrophic calcifications in left basal ganglia and adjacent developmental venous anomaly without signs of thrombosis.
Acute infarct left basal ganglia. Associated calcification and likely developmental venous anomaly without conspicuous signs of thrombosis.
For the non-enhanced CT, the main differential is that of the calcifications: aging, Fahr disease, toxic, infectious, metabolic.

The restriction of DWI in this case was diagnostic of stroke.
A 68 y.o. woman presents with acute right hemiplegia, of approximately 20 hours evolution.
Interestingly, this case shows an association of the stroke with dystrophic calcifications in the same location, the left caudate and putamen, and with an adjacent developmental venous  anomaly (DVA), which raise concerns about a possible relation between them. However, due to the high prevalence of the DVA (1-9% of the population), we cannot rule out a mere incidental finding. No radiological findings supporting thrombosis or stenosis of the DVA were present. The association of the DVA with underlying calcifications involving the caudate and putamen was already described.
The location of the DVA in the deep white matter, periventricular and adjacent to the frontal horn of the left lateral ventricle as in the present case is typical.

In the vast majority of the cases, DVAs are asymptomatic, being completely incidental findings, although there were reported venous infarcts and haemorrhages secondary to thrombosis or stenosis of the DVA, which according to recent data could occur in around 0.2%/year. On the other hand, symptomatology can be the result of other conditions associated with DVA, as seizures and haemorrhages when a cavernoma is present.
