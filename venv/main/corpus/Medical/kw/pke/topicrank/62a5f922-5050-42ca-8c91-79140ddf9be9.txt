Gerota&#39;s fascia surrounds the perinephric space.  It is a dense connective tissue, typically <2mm thick, surrounding the kidney, adrenal gland, renal hilum including renal vessels and proximal collecting system, and the perinephric fat.  Throughout the perinephric fat there are bridging septa known as Kunin&#39;s Septa, normally visible on high-res CT in patients with adequate perinephric fat.  These septa may become thickened in association with pathologic processes including ureteral obstruction, renal infection, renal vein thrombosis, renal tumors, and retroperitoneal fluid collections.  These thickened perinephric septa have been described as "pernephric cobwebs" and "perinephric stranding."
