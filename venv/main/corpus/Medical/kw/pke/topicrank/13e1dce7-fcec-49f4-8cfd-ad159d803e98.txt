She uses a cane and has an antalgic gait. Her left ankle is swollen with a visible scar.  She has limited ROM of lumbar spine. Lumbar flexion, extension, excursion, right lateral bending and left lateral bending are all 50% below normal. Straight leg test  at 30-40 degrees produced lower back pain with ipsilateral lower extremity pain to the ankle.  Heel and toe walk were performed with difficulty due to low back pain. Achilles reflex absent bilaterally; knee reflex absent on right and +1 on left. Muscle strengths were measured with a computerized strain gauge and revealed that the hip extensors on the left side displayed a 44% relative deficiency and the extensors and the toe extensors on the left side and had a measured 32% deficiency on the left side for the dorsiflexors of the left foot including extensor digitorum brevis, extensor digitorum longus and extenor hallucis longus muscles. 

Monofilament sensory testing showed diminished light touch on the dorsal aspect of both feet, and plantar aspect of left foot compared with normal parameters consistent with S1 and L5 dermatomal hypesthesia.  

EMG studies showed chronic left and right S1 radiculopathies, delayed tibial nerve H-reflexes bilaterally, and abnormal needle EMG examination of the left and right gastrocnemius medius muscles. No evidence of lumbosacral plexopathy, focal lower extremity entrapment syndrome, diffuse neuropathy or myopathy was observed.
Treatment:
1)	Patient is currently taking Tylenol with Codeine, which helps relieve her pain acutely. 
2)	She is currently receiving chiropractic care, with symptom benefit.  
3)	It may be worthwhile to try steroid injections if pain does not improve. 
4)	Weight loss and diet changes may also be beneficial to relieve stress on her lower back. 

Follow up:
1)	Continue to monitor patient’s progress every 4 weeks. 
2)	If patient continues to deteriorate or develops neurologic or motor deficits, it may be worthwhile to get a neurosurgery consult.
Lumbar spine MRI showed: 
1)	Minimal diffuse disc bulge at L4-L5 level with a central annular tear noted
2)	There is a small left paracentral disc herniation effacing the fat ventral to the descending left S1 nerve root; mild foraminal stenosis is also noted on left side.
3)	Levoscoliosis of lumbar spine
Lumbosacral compressive and chemical radiculopathy.
1)	Lumbosacral radiculopathy compressive discal etiology
2)	Lumbar radiculopathy chemical irritative/inflammatory etiology
3)	Spinal stenosis
4)	Diabetic neuropathy
Patient is a 57-year old African American female who complains of low back pain and occasional numbness and tingling of both her feet after being involved in a vehicle-related accident. She reported being dragged on the pavement by a taxi face first for ? a block after her coat got caught in the door. Prior to the accident, she has had a history of low back pain. Three years ago, she injured her lower back in another vehicular accident where she sustained fracture.     She reports a worsening of her lower back pain as a result of the recent MVA and since is experiencing numbness and tingling on both feet when she walks.  Patient has a history of type 2 DM, HTN, GERD, anxiety, depression, gastric ulcers, high cholesterol, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, asthma and a previous bleeding disorder. In 2008, post MVA where she sustained a left ankle injury that required placement of ankle pins and plate.

Patient’s low back pain and radicular symptoms is most likely due to the combination of compressive and chemical radiculopathy as evidenced by the results of her MRI scan and EMG results.  The MRI of the lumbar spine demonstrated small left paracentral disc herniation at the L5-S1 level and an annular tear at the L4-L5 level.   Given her findings at the L5/S1 level one might anticipate a left S1 radiculopthy.  However, her symptoms are bilateral.  Additionally, her EMG results also demonstrated chronic S1 bilateral radiculopathies with an abnormal EMG needle examination on her gastrocnemius muscle bilaterally (innervated by S1 and S2).  As such the findings strictly at the L5/S1 level do not appear to promulgate the concept of a bilateral S1 radiculopathy but rather support a unilateral finding.  The presence of disc herniation at the L5/S1 level and the annular tear at the L4/L5 level could result in chemical bathing of the nerve roots in the associated region.  It is therefore, my contention that the bilateral S1 radiculopathy is likely from both compressive and chemical processes.  The imaging and EMG findings could also help explain the diminished sense of touch on both the dorsal side of her feet bilaterally, and on the plantar aspect of her left foot. Her history of diabetes could also contribute to her diminished sense of touch on both feet.  It is unlikely that her ankle injury contributes to her current complaint of numbness and tingling on both feet because nerve entrapment has been excluded from her most recent EMG exam.
