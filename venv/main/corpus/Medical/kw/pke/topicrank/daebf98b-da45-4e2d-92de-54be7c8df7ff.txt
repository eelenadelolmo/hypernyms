The patient was taken to the operating room for incision and drainage of neck abscesses and mediastinal exploration.  He remained in critical condition, intubated and sedated, and was spiking regular fevers.  The patient was again taken to the operating room for drainage and continued postoperative care in the SICU.  The patientâ€™s condition improved and he was transferred to the floor.  No wound, blood, or urine cultures yielded growth of any organisms.  He underwent 2 further weeks of IV antibiotics and continued wound packing twice daily.  The patient was afebrile upon discharge.
CT of the neck demonstrates multiple abscesses (some gas-containing) in the retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, submandibular, and anterior visceral spaces, as well as the anterior mediastinum.
