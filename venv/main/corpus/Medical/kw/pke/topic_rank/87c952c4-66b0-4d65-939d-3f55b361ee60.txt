Physical exam is remarkable only for S shaped scoliosis (right thoracic curve and left lumbar curve).
No abnormal laboratory findings.
En bloc surgical resection of T11 Osteoid Osteoma

Follow up: If symptoms recur
Standing AP and lateral thoracolumbar spine:
S-shaped thoracolumbar scoliosis. 16 degrees dextroscoliosis between T2 and T8.
33 degree levoscoliosis between T9 and L2. 19 degree
dextroscoliosis between L3 and L5

MRI of the thoracic spine: Mildly enhancing mass at the lamina of T11 on the right side which measures 2.7 x 1.3 x 2.0 cm. Likely originating in the soft tissue and
eroding into the pedicle. Corresponds to the apex of the
levoscoliosis. Edema present in right erector spinae musculature.

CT of the thoracic spine:
Area of abnormality on the MR is along the
lamina of the T11 vertebral body just medial to the inferior costal facet. There is a well-defined 1 cm lytic lesion with a bony nidus which demonstrates a large amount of benign appearing sclerotic bony
overgrowth in the surrounding bone.
