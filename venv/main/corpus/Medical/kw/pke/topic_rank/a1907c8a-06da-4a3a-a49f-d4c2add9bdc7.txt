No pertinent laboratory values.
The patient was treated with radical nephrectomy followed by combination chemotherapy consisting of vincristine, doxorubicin, and dactinomycin for 15 months.
Initial upright and supine radiographs of the abdomen demonstrated a large soft tissue density/mass within the left hemiabdomen that appears to displace large bowel medially.
Follow-up CT scan images demonstrated a large apparent subcapsular mass lesion emanating from the lower pole of the left kidney that causes mass-effect and cortical thinning.

3 year old Asian boy presents to the emergency department with a 1 week history of left flank pain (5/10 inensity) that presented after trivial trauma.  Patient's mother noted that felt a slight bulge in the left flank region.
This patient was found to have postitive margins after surgery with extension to the left colon and adjacent mesentery (i.e. Grade III disease). However, this did not change his subsequent neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
