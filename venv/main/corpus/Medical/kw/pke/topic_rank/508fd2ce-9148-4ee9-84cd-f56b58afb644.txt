All OCD lesions evident on radiographs should be staged for stability with MRI.

Stage I--Thickening of articular cartilage and low signal changes (stable)

Stage II--Articular cartilage breached, low-signal rim behind fragment indicating fibrous attachment (stable)

Stage III--Articular cartilage breached, high-signal changes behind fragment and underlying subchondral bone (unstable)

Stage IV--Loose body (unstable)

Factors such as location of the lesion, relationship to weight-bearing surface, stability, physis closure and clinical presentation should be considered. Nonsurgical management is indicated in cases of juvenile OCD, particularly in patients with open physeal plates. Approximately one half of lesions resolve over a period of 10 to 18 months with conservative measures. Girls younger than 11 years of age and boys younger than 13 years of age have an excellent chance of resolution, while patients over 20 years of age tend to have poorer outcomes, and the likelihood of requiring surgical intervention is increased.  Unstable lesions (stages III and IV) in patients with a closed physis have a particularly poor prognosis. More aggressive intervention is indicated in older symptomatic patients.
AP and oblique views of the right knee demonstrate a lucent subchondral lesion with sclerotic border residing in lateral aspect of medial femoral condyle.  On lateral view, bony fragmentation is seen.
