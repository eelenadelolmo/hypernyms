WBC 14.1 (3.6 to 10.6 normal range)

UA:
positive blood with 119 RBC/HPF
nitrate positive
leukocyst esterase negative

Urine culture negative after 24 hours
The patient was given Percocet 325/5 mg q4 hr prn and Alfuzosin 10 mg qd, instructions for hydration and a follow-up appointment with Urology.  In retrospect, the left UVJ stone may be visible on the initial radiograph.  Repeat plain films could therefore be used to reassess if clinically indicated.
1. KUB - No evident urinary calculus.

2. Stone protocol CT - The right kidney demonstrates a prominent extrarenal pelvis, but is otherwise unremarkable. The left kidney also has a prominent extrarenal pelvis with a 5 mm stone at the ureteropelvic junction. Mild hydroureter continues from this stone distally to a 6 mm stone at the uterovesical junction which demonstrates surrounding soft tissue swelling and edema.  Within the left renal inferior pole there is a 3 mm calyceal calculus. There is fat stranding surrounding the left kidney, likely edema.

3. In retrospect, the left UVJ stone may be visible on the initial KUB.

While UPJ and UVJ obstruction from ureterolithiasis can occur following lithotripsy, the current patient presented acutely without a history of treatment or a prior diagnosis.
