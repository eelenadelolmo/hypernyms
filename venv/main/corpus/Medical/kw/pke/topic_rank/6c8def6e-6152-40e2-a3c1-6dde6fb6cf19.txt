Pain and swelling anterior shin.
Wide surgical excision.  No mets at time of diagnosis, reflecting a positive prognosis.
A mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion is noted in the anterior tibial diaphysis, predominantly cortical.  The lesion demonstrates increased radionuclide uptake and is FDG avid.
Adamantinoma
• Adamantinoma 
• Osteofibrous dysplasia
• Nonossifying Fibroma
• Fibrous Dysplasia
• Chondromyxoid fibroma 
• Intraosseous hemangioma

Adamantinomas have a mixed lytic and sclerotic, sometimes expansile  "soap bubbly", appearance on plain film and CT.   The location is very specific (90% anterior tibial cortex).  Tc99m-HDP bone scan shows increased radiotracer uptake, as the radiotracer localizes to osteoblastic activity.  PET is used to search for possible mets.  Both the primary and metastatic lesions display increased F18-FLUORODEOXYGLUCOSE metabolism.
