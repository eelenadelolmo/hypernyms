The dislocation was successfully reduced by closed reduction.  His follow-up care will consist primarily of physical therapy/strengthening exercises to improve stability of the joint and prevent recurrent dislocations.
Image 1 is an AP 40 degree oblique radiograph of the right shoulder. Normally, there should be no overlap between the humeral head and glenoid at this angle. Note the slight overlap of the humeral head and the glenoid, which is suggestive of a posterior shoulder dislocation. 

Image 2 is a lateral, transcapular Y view, which demonstrates that the humeral head is posterior to the glenoid and inferior to the acromion.

Image 3 is an axillary view, which again demonstrates the posterior position of the humeral head in relation to the glenoid.
Posterior Shoulder Dislocation
posterior shoulder dislocation
19 y.o. soldier was medically evacuated from XXXX for a shoulder injury sustained on a work detail.  He lifted air conditioners out of a truck with the help of another soldier. He denied any fall or other acute trauma. He sought medical treatment at the base clinic.  Conservative treatment efforts did not alleviate his pain and he was medically evacuated to a stateside tertiary hospital under the care of the orthopedic service.
This is an unusual case of posterior shoulder dislocation due to the mechanism of injury.  The patient was simply lifting heavy items and recalled no specific moment of injury.  He also denied any prior history of shoulder dislocation or other shoulder injury. He felt pain after the task and sought treatment.  

Despite taking radiographs in XXXX, the diagnosis was apparently missed (common for this injury), and treatment efforts in theater were unsuccessful.
