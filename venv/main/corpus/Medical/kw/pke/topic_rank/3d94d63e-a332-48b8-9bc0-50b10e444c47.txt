Entrance wound in lateral right leg
Fragments track into left thigh
External fixation device was placed between the iliac crest and distal femur.
Entrance wound in lateral right leg impacting the right femur in the proximal diaphysis causing severe comminution of the femur at the impact site creating many secondary missiles.  Profound fragmentation of the bullet is then seen making it easy to track the path of the projectile across the medial right thigh, through the scrotal area, into and through the left thigh.
