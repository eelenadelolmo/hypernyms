Normal percussion bilaterally, with a few inspiratory crackles in the left lower lung field. Afebrile.
Pending possible left lower lobectomy
There is extensive cylindrical bronchiectasis of the left lower lobe and lingula, with relative sparing of the upper lobes bilaterally. There is less pronounced bronchiectasis present within the right middle lobe and medial right lower lobe. Also observed is mild centrilobular emphysema. There are secretions present in the distal bronchiectatic airways.  Near the pleura, peripheral airways measure up to 1.5 cm in diameter. Due to both the inspiratory and expiratory phases of this study it is important to note that air trapping was observed in the left lower lobe.
