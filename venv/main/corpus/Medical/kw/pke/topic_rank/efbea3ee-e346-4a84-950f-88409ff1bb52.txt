This resulted in fetal demise
A thin soft tissue web is seen in the amnionitic cavity along the posterior aspect of the skull and cervical spine.  Closer inspection demonstrates that this is a markedly dilated cystic structure arising from the back of the neck.  Evaluation of the rest of the fetus demonstrates pleural effusions, ascites and marked skin thickening over the extremities.
Cystic hygroma (Turner's syndrome)
Hydrops - Immune vs Non-immune with asymmetrical thickening of the neck soft tissues

Massive cystic hygroma and hydrops - more often associated with Turner's syndrome

Nuchal fold thickening and hydrops - Down Syndrome with the fetus developing failure / hydrops
Pt with an uncomplicated pregnancy presenting for second trimester anatomic screening obstetrical ultrasound
Hydrops in general, irrespective of karyotype being normal or abnormal or the perceived severity of the anomalies identified, is a poor prognostic indicator for a fetus.
