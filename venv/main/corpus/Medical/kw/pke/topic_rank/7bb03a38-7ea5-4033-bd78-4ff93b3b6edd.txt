Classic MRI findings of a benign cord lipoma.
Spinal Cord Lipoma
Increasing pain and weakness in both legs.
A spinal cord lipoma is a benign tumor of the spinal cord.  This lipoma encases nerve roots of the proximal cauda equina just distal to the conus medullaris.  There is no evidence of cord tethering.  This encasement is likely causing compression and irritation of the nerve roots, which is causing the patient clinical symptoms.

Cord lipomas can be found at any level, with no specific segmental preference.  There can be an association with spinal dysraphism.

Partial surgical resection is possible, however iatrogenic nerve damage can occur with aggressive attempts at removal.
