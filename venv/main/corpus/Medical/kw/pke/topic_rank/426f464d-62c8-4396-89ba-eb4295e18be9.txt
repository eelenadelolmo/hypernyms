Musculoskeletal:  Good ROM with muscle strength intact.  

Extremities:  No clubbing or cyanosis.  

Skin: Cool to touch without dermatitis or ulcerations.  

Psych:  Alert and oriented; normal affect.

Laboratory tests were normal with no elevation of cardiac enzymes.
A 48-hour Holter monitor to evaluate for arrhythmias was ordered.  The monitor revealed an 8-beat run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. She also had a few atrial tachycardia runs as well.

Due to concerns about her risk of a potential lethal arrhythmia with her condition, it was recommended proceeding with the implementation of a defibrillator. A dual-chamber cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted without complications.

The patient was also counseled on the importance of weight loss as an aid to her symptoms of dyspnea.

Lasix was prescribed.
» Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with maximum wall thickness of 2 cm. There is mid cavity obstruction and a possible small apical aneurysm. The maximum wall thickness at basal LV is 1.4 cm involving inferoseptum. The maximum mid LV wall thickness is 1.8 cm at inferoseptum and maximum apical wall thickness is 2 cm at apical septum.

» No evidence of LV outflow tract obstruction. There is no mitral valve systolic anterior motion. 

» No myocardial infarction or fibrosis as indicated by late gadolinium enhancement.
Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, episodes of ventricular tachycardia.
• Physiological Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (Athlete’s Heart)

• Pathophysiological Hypertrophy due to aortic stenosis or hypertension

• Infiltrative heart muscle disease or storage disorder such as Fabry’s Disease
A 59 year old female patient presents for evaluation of ongoing chest pain and shortness of breath with exertion.  The patient states that she had onset of nausea, diaphoresis and extreme fatigue while doing some general household tasks.  

She describes her discomfort as left shoulder pain that radiates across to the left side of her chest.  She mentions that since this episode she has had daily chest pain, particularly with exertion or emotional stress. 

She has never had any issues with syncope or near syncope. She has never smoked and denies exposure to secondary tobacco smoke. She denies any alcohol or recreational drug use.

Past Medical History: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome with bilateral pneumonia three years ago. The patient has never had pulmonary function studies.  

Family History:  The patient has no family history of early onset coronary artery disease, but she does have a history in the family of arrhythmia. 

Her mother has atrial fibrillation.  She has a sister and a brother, both of whom have atrial fibrillation.  She denies any family history of sudden unexplained death or fatal arrhythmia.  She has two children, ages 37 and 30, the oldest does have a history of "heart palpitations," which has been diagnosed as benign PVCs.

An Echocardiogram study showed the patient has marked left ventricular hypertrophy, but no evidence of obstruction.  She does have some mild to moderate aortic insufficiency.  Her ejection fraction is normal. 

An EKG study showed the patient has sinus rhythm 60 beats per minute with a short PR, interval of 110 milliseconds.  EKG also demonstrates left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormality. Flipped T-waves are noted throughout.

The patient is sent for a cardiac MRI evaluation.
