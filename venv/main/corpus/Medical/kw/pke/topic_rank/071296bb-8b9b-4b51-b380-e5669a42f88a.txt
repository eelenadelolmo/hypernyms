Routine "non-destructive inspection" of a military aircraft via x-ray to look for defects
http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/h-53.htm

Imaging modalities such as x-ray and ultrasound are utilized to inspect for structural defects in military aircraft. This is performed as an adjunct to other forms of daily aircraft inpections in order to ensure safety for pilots and aircrew. A portable x-ray machine can be carried out to the flight line to shoot films of aircraft, which are then reveiwed by NDI (non-destructive inpection) technicians trained to find cracks or other defects invisible to the naked eye. Ultrasound is also used in this inspection process although it is two-dimensional. NDI technicians also use x-ray to confirm the structural integrity of other hardware such as welds before these components are used.
