Non-productive cough, otherwise normal physical exam.
Direct surgical intervention was performed.  This patient recovered uneventfully from surgery.  No follow-up is required after the post-operative recovery period.
PA and lateral chest radiograph: Vague airspace opacity within the left lung base, which partially silhouettes the left heart border near the apex, representing lingular pneumonia.  Additionally, there is an ovoid soft-tissue density with peripheral calcifications seen occupying the left upper quadrant that measures 15.8cm X 12.4cm X 12.9cm, likely representing a calcified splenic cyst. 
  
CT abdomen/pelvis:  Confirms a large cyst within in the spleen with a thin calcified rim.  The spleen is enlarged secondary to cyst.  The pancreas and stomach are displaced to the right.  The colon is displaced inferiorly.  The left kidney is slightly compressed.
Primary Epidermoid Splenic Cyst
• Post-traumatic “False-cyst”
• True (epidermoid) cyst
• Abscess (pyogenic or fungal)
• Hydatid cyst
• Infarction
• Benign neoplastic (Hemangioma, lymphangioma)
• Malignancy (lymphoma, metastasis)
• Splenic peliosis
31 y.o. woman with 6 weeks of cough.
A splenic cyst (or multiple cysts) may be noted as an incidental finding on conventional imaging techniques, as in this case, or as a result of evaluation of a patient with left upper quadrant pain, left shoulder pain, abdominal enlargement, or splenomegaly. The differential considerations for a splenic cyst include post-traumatic, epidermoid cyst, abscess, hydatid cyst, infarction, splenic peliosis, and neoplasia, both benign and malignant.  80% of cases in North America are post-traumatic.  Direct surgical intervention in this case yielded a diagnosis of epidermoid cyst, as defined by the presence of an inner endothelial lining.

Splenic cysts can remain stable in size for many years, or enlarge slowly, occasionally to massive proportion (as was the case with this patient).  The potential for rupture and hemorrhage increases with increasing size.  There is also a risk for secondary infection.  Optimal surgical management is not clearly defined, but a number of procedures are available for symptomatic or enlarging cysts.  Available options for those with non-parasitic cysts include percutaneous procedures (eg, biopsy, aspiration, drainage), or more direct surgical interventions such as decapsulation/cyst wall unroofing, partial or total splenectomy.  However, only splenectomy provides diagnostic certainty, which is rarely clinically justified.
