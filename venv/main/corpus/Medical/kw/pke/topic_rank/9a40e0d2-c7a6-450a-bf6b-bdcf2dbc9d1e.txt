23 year old Mexican man with 3 months of severe headache.
Cysticercosis - taenia solium - as been a parasitic infection of man for over 10,000 years.  Fecal contamination of pig feed leads to infection in swine - producing numerous cysts in the meat, or "measly" pork  NOTE: While some sources suggest trichinae as the cause of "measly" pork - it is larval cysticercosis that produces cysts within the pork.
