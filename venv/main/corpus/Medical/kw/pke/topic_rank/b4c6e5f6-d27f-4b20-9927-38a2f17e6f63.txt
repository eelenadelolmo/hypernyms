Renal Biopsy Report:

Microscopic: 3 core bx or renal cortex, 2 cores include the renal capsule. Glomeruli- 4/13 globally sclerotic (13%), normal or mildly increased in size, diffuse mild-moderate global or segmental PAS positive mesangial expansion, segmental mild mesangial proliferation in 3 glomeruli, cellular crescents in 2 glomeruli, fibrocellular crescents in 3, and segmental necrosis without crescent formation in 1 glomerulus, fibrous crescent in 1 glomerulus. Tubulointerstitium- well circumscribed zones of inflammation with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and rare eosinophils involving estimated 5-10 % of cortex, foci of interstitial PMN’s adjacent to active crescents, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy in 10-25% cortex. Blood vessels- 3 small interlobular arteries and visible periglomerular arterioles without dx pathological changes.

Immunofluorescence: 10 glomeruli, zero % globally sclerotic; IgA 1+ focal segmental granular paramesangial/mesangial, positive epithelial cells, positive protein granules and casts; IgG 1+ focal segmental granular paramesangial/mesangial, positive protein granules and casts, positive nuclear; IgM 1+ granular paramesangial/mesangial and segmental capillary; kappa glomeruli negative, positive casts; lambda glomeruli negative, positive casts; C1q 1+ granular paramesangial/mesangial; C3 1+ granular paramesangial/mesangial; albumin and fibrinogen 1+ focal segmental glomerular in 3/10 glomeruli.

EM: 1 glomerulus. Mesangial expansion with numerous sized electron dense deposits, mesangial/paramesangial, and focal subepithelial; endocapillary inflammatory cells, tubuloredicular inclusions in glomerular and peritubular capillary endothelium; epithelial foot process simplification/effacement with incomplete involvement of most capillaries, overall involvement estimated 20-30%; incomplete loss of endothelial fenestrations.

Final Pathology Dx:
Left Kidney- percutaneous needle bx
Active and sclerosing immune complex GN consistent with LN ISN/RPS class 3 A/C; cellular crescents, fibrocellular crescents, or segmental necrosis are identified in 20% of glomeruli.
Comment- Unusual features include: IgM dominant fluorescence and presence of necrosis and crescent formation with subendothelial deposits. These features taken together suggest mechanism of autoimmune injury not typical of LN.
Patient will be advised to continue current medication regimen of mycophenolate mofetil, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, montelukast sodium, and belimumab for her current medical conditions. It is imperative that the patient continues with her immunosuppressive therapy of mycophenolate mofetil to adequately treat her focal lupus nephritis ISN/RPS class III A/C and prevent relapse with recurrence of renal inflammation and damage. Patient will be advised to continue hydroxychloroquine sulfate and belimumab medications as these will help control much of the other clinical ailments associated with SLE and its effects on multiple organ systems. Patient has noted increased asthma symptoms and will be advised to continue montelukast sodium as prescribed previously. Patient is now in the maintenance phase of therapy for her focal lupus nephritis and will be advised to follow up every 3 months with her nephrologist where evaluation to monitor LN progression will consist of physical exam, urine protein, UA, serum C3 / C4 / anti-DNA levels, CBC, and LFT’s will ensue.

Sclerosing immune complex glomerulonephritis consistent with focal lupus nephritis ISN/RPS class III A/C
1) Focal Lupus Nephritis
2) C3 Glomerulonephritis
3) Post Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis 
4) IgA Nephropthy
Patient is a 35-year-old African American Female G1P1 with a previous PMH of asthma and atopic dermatitis who 4 years ago (3/19/2013) initially presented to the ED due to acute onset of “dark blueish / purple spots on the inside of her mouth and red bruises on her arms” with no recent history of trauma or illness. She notes that while in the ED she further developed “petechiae” on her arms and legs. Patient’s initial lab results showed thrombocytopenia and normocytic anemia. Upon further workup and hospitalization consisting of multiple blood transfusions the patient was diagnosed with ITP (idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura and SLE  (systemic lupus erythematosus). She was started on a tapered course of prednisone and hydroxychloroquine sulfate and later followed up with hematology and rheumatology. 

Six months later patient experienced a 2 month history of 2-6 /10 crampy, non-radiating, lower back / buttocks / abdominal pain, which upon further US and CT imaging and eventual surgery found to be due to a mature cystic teratoma. Patient underwent left oophorectomy during surgery. Of note, patient also has had hysterectomy due to uterine fibroids. Otherwise, until 07/10/2017 (4 years after dx of SLE and ITP) patient’s chronic conditions had been well managed with hydroxychloroquine, and montelukast.

Patient states that after routine follow up with her rheumatologist on 07/10/2017 there were UA findings of hematuria and proteinuria (555 - 650) in the patient’s urine. She was referred to a nephrologist where further evaluation through US imaging and biopsy were performed on 08/30/2017. Renal biopsy showed new diagnosis of glomerular kidney disease, active and sclerosing immune complex GN consistent with LN ISN/RPS class 3 A/C . Patient was started on mycophenolate mofetil in addition to her previous medications, and also notes a course of tapered prednisone. Patient also notes that she had begun a new SLE medication, belimumab, during late August 2017.

Kidney disease is often referred to as the “silent illness,” as often patients are asymptomatic in the earlier stages, and by the time they do become symptomatic they already have severely advanced renal disease. Due to this renal disease plays a large role in overall morbidity and mortality, and throughout the past few decades has become a major public health concern. Recent statistics from the NIH have shown that renal disease is responsible for more deaths in a year than breast and prostate cancer combined, and accounts for approximately 50 Billion dollars in Medicaid spending per year [1-3]. Although the incidence of the disease has stabilized over the past few years it still has a substantial prevalence at 14% of the general population, which is why awareness for disease and prevention and proactive efforts for diagnosis is important. It is important to first understand that renal disease consists of a wide variety of disorders (glomerular disease, tubular disease, vascular disease ect.). For this discussion we will focus on glomerular disease (consisting of nephritic and nephrotic conditions), specifically focusing on lupus nephritis (LN) and C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) and how these conditions manifested in our patient.      

What is interesting about our patient's case is that she initially presented with dark blueish / purple spots on the inside of her mouth and red bruises on her arms, which was later diagnosed during her hospital visit as ITP (immune thrombocytopenic purpura). Primary ITP is an autoimmune process in which auto-antibodies are produced against the hosts platelets. These antibodies coat host platelets and damage them resulting in their removal by the spleen resulting in thrombocytopenia and increased bleeding risk. Around that same time laboratory findings also were significant for a diagnosis of SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus). Traditionally primary ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion if there is only findings of thrombocytopenia without any other findings indicative of another etiology. With this being said, it appears that our patient had a secondary diagnosis of [SLE] associated with  ITP. The diagnosis of SLE with the ITP co-morbidity has been shown to be rare as in a  recent study of 152 patients diagnosed with SLE there was reclassification of 12 individuals having secondary ITP (8 percent) during the two years of evaluation [4]. Although the patient at the time of the [SLE] associated ITP diagnosis had no laboratory evidence of renal disease, the likelihood of the patient to develop kidney disease in the future has been reported as 50% just with only the singular diagnosis of SLE. No studies with significant data could be found to support increased risk of renal disease with both SLE and ITP diagnosis.

As stated previously, it is important for those at risk for renal disease to be advised about preventative measures, proactive screening and diagnostic procedures to diagnose renal disease in its earliest stages even when its is asymptomatic. In our patient’s case, regular follow up and screening with her rheumatologist helped identify early urinary irregularities (microhematuria and proteinuria with normal GFR). This allowed for further evaluation resulting in diagnosis. The evaluation algorithm for hematuria and proteinuria begins with serologic testing, then imaging (renal US, CT, or IVP), and finally biopsy, (if the diagnosis was not made from prior studies). In this patient’s case serologic testing showed supportive findings for SLE, but imaging was needed to rule out any other possible diagnosis. Renal US was performed without any pathological findings. At this time there are no imaging studies that can accurately diagnose glomerular disease. A renal biopsy was needed to be performed for not only a clear diagnosis, but also the fact that specific diagnosis and classification aids in therapeutic decision making for glomerular disease. Prior to biopsy a plausible nephritic syndrome (proteinuria < 3.5 g per day or 2+ or less on urine dipstick analysis) differential diagnosis consisted of  Lupus Nephritis (especially in the context of a SLE diagnosis), C3 Glomerulonephritis (a rare form of MPGN but not out of reach considering the laboratory findings and possible preceding URI), Post Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis (considering labs and possibility of preceding URI), and IgA Nephropathy. 

It was not surprising that the biopsy findings were indicative of Lupus Nephritis (specifically - sclerosing immune complex glomerulonephritis class III A/C). The following findings were indicative of this diagnosis: glomeruli 4/13 globally sclerotic (13%) which is less than the 50% glomeruli involvement limit on LM;  mesangial expansion with numerous sized electron dense deposits and inclusions in glomerular and peritubular capillary endothelium on EM; and class A/C findings of active and chronic sclerosing lesions.  

LN class III A/C Description:
Focal lupus nephritis (class III) - Hematuria and proteinuria are present, with possible hypertension decreased GFR and/or nephrotic syndrome. Histologic findings of 50 percent or less of glomeruli affected on light microscopy, IM shows all glomeruli affected, EM shows mesangium and capillary wall subendothelial deposits [42]. Further subclass categories of class III are as follows: 1. Class III (A), active lesions, focal proliferative lupus nephritis 2. Class III (A/C), active and chronic lesions, focal proliferative and sclerosing lupus nephritis 3.Class III (C), chronic inactive lesions with scarring, focal sclerosing lupus nephritis [7]. 

This case was not completely straightforward as there were unusual features which  include: IgM dominant fluorescence and presence of necrosis and crescent formation with subendothelial deposits; these features taken together suggest mechanism of autoimmune injury not typical of LN. C3GN is a subclass of MPGN which has EM findings of subendothelial and mesangial electron-dense deposits possibly similar to what is seen in addition to the LN findings [5,6]. If this is the case the question is how does this affect overall management? Surprisingly, the recommended non-immunosuppressive agents (ACEI, ARB, and lipid lowering agents) and immunosuppressives are the same. There has been some debate about the effectiveness of immunosuppressive therapy, but in a recent retrospective cohort study of 60 C3GN patients the immunotherapy combination of mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids was found to be therapeutically effective in C3GN [8]. Immunosuppressive therapy consists of aggressive induction and less aggressive maintenance phases. Patient is in maintenance phase with stable disease and currently following up with the nephrologist every few months for routine examination. 

The prognosis of either LN or C3GN varies amongst patients, but both carry the risk of renal disease progression to ESRD. Reassuringly, what has been noted in both diseases is that early administration of non-immunosuppressive and immunosuppressive therapies have greatly reduced the rate of progression to ESRD. Interestingly, there were not many records or studies of patients with both LN and C3GN documented. Possible further investigation should be performed into the incidence of having both LN and C3GN disease and its associated variety of clinical symptoms, risk factors, and prognosis would be informative.
