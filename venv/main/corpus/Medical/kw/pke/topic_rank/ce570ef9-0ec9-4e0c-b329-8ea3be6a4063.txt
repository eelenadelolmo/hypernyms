Texto: 
Right shoulder pain with active and passive range of motion. No paresthesias of the shoulder, arm, or hand. Pulses intact distally. Sensation intact. Motor strength 3/5 secondary to pain.
Dual needle aspiration and percutaneous injection of cortical steroids. (80-200mg of methylprednisonolone)

Percutaneous injection of the demineralized bone matrix and autogenous bone marrow.

Subtotal Resection or packing with synthetic material.

Intramedullary Rod Placement
RADIOLOGY:

-PLAIN FILMS FINDINGS:  Centrally located, well-defined, expansile, lucent lesion. 
-Parallel to long axis of the host bone.
-Sclerotic margin
-Scalloping of underlying cortex
-Fluid filled cavity
-No periosteal reaction unless a fracture is involved.
-No extension into soft tissues
-“Fallen fragment sign” secondary to pathologic fracture. This fragment migrates to the dependent portion of a cyst.

CT FINDINGS:

Fluid-filled cavity at 15-20 Hounsfield units. 
No enhancement.
Remodeled bone expansion with thin cortices and thin bony septae.

MR FINDINGS:
T1W1: Low to intermediate signal intensity
T2W1: High signal intensity. Heterogeneous signal in case of fracture with blood products
Unicameral bone cyst
Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC)

Fibrous dysplasia

Fibroxanthoma

Bone abscess

Enchondroma

Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis

Brown tumors
22 y/o female presents with right shoulder pain status post fall. She denies numbness, tingling, or weakness.
Patient was treated conservatively with an arm sling and referred to physical therapy to increase the range of motion. Surgical intervention would be considered only if she re-fractures the humerus or if she cannot tolerate the arm pain.
