Birth weight was 575 grams.  Apgar scores were 0 at 1 minute, 1 at 5 minutes, and 6 at 10 minutes at birth.  Infant was normocephalic without any visible congenital defects.  Cardiac exam was normal.  Infant showed clinical signs of respiratory distress.
Infant was placed on triple antibiotic therapy of Gentamicin, Ampicillin and Vancomycin.

Pediatric Surgery is consulted but no surgical intervention is recommended due to infant’s poor prognosis.  Infant ultimately dies at day 50 of life.
In addition to signs of chronic lung disease of prematurity, there are uniformly dilated loops of bowel throughout abdomen. There is pneumatosis present in the right lower quadrant and diffuse portal venous gas.  No evidence of perforation or pneumoperitoneum is identified.
Necrotizing Enterocolitis
• Necrotizing Enterocolitis
• Hirschsprung disease
• Intestinal hypoperistalsis syndromes
• Adynamic ileus
This is a premature infant, born at 24 weeks gestation.  Membranes ruptured 1.5 hours prior to delivery via emergency C-section.     Infant was admitted to NICU with initial diagnoses of prematurity, low birth weight, respiratory failure secondary to surfactant deficiency and sepsis (cultures were ultimately negative).  Infant is fed breast milk supplemented with formula via nasogastric tube and progressively gains weight in the first weeks of life.  Infant then slowly deteriorates clinically and subsequent babygrams shows evidence of worsening respiratory distress and bowl distension.
Autopsy was refused by mother.  In addition to radiographic evidence, infant showed clinical signs of necrotizing enterocolitis (fever, abdominal distention, bloody stool).
