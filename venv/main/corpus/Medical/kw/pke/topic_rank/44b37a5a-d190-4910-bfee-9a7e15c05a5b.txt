Unenhanced CT scout image and axial CT images demonstrate two calcifications adjacent to the cecum, within soft tissue likely representing the appendix, consistent with appendicoliths.   The appendix, however, is not enlarged, and there is no evidence of periappendiceal inflammation.  No calcifications within the kidneys, ureters or bladder were noted.
