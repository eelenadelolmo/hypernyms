Patient returned to home area with instructions to follow up with her primary care manager to establish care with orthopedic surgeon.  She requires further care and rehabilitation.  Patient was recommended to consider a bone scan and evaluation for possible decreased bone density given low energy mechanism of injury.
Bi-vs Tri-Malleolar Fracture with subluxation of ankle
Bimalleolar fracture of right ankle
Bimaleolar fracture with subluxation of right ankle
Trimalleolar fracture with subluxation of ankle
Pt is a 79 y/o F with history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented to the ED complaining of right foot pain, swelling, and bruising since the evening before after stepping off of a curb and falling.  No hx of prior falls.  No presyncope, vertigo, or other precipitating factors; Patient reports she just tripped and rolled her ankle which took most of the force of the fall, rolled onto right side of body, did not hit head, no pain anywhere else on body.   Denies cardiac, neuro, or other symptoms. Patient is visiting friends from out of town.
Ankle fractures consist of approximately 10% of all bone injuries.  Of these, 70% are unimalleolar, 20% are bimalleolar, and 10% are trimalleolar.  In one study of 9767 ankle fractures from 2005 to 2014 occurred at a rate of 168.7/100,000/year.  In the same study, the incidence decreased after the age of 19 in males.  In females, a bimodal distribution was observed with a peak between 10-19 years of age, followed by increasing incidence above 70 years of age. (1)

The Danis-Weber classification system describes 3 types of fibular fractures based on the location of the fracture in relation to the syndesmosis.  Type A occurs below the level of the tibial plafond, type B occur at the level of the tibial plafond and extend proximally in an oblique direction.  Finally, Weber type C occur proximal to the tibial plafond and often are associated with a syndesmosis injury.  Type C also can occur with medial malleolus fractures such as in this case.  (2)

Bimalleolar fractures are generally considered unstable and require operative fixation.  In a review of geriatric patient records from Medicare Part A from 2008, 19648 patients with ankle fractures were identified.  Of these, 15193 underwent operative intervention (77.3%).  The study revealed patients underwent a comparable hospital stay (4.5 for nonoperative vs 4.6 for operative patients) and had average ages of 80.9 and 76.5 respectively.  One year mortality was 21.5% for the nonoperative group and 9.1% for the operative group.  Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated an odds ratio of 0.534 of death within 1 year for patients undergoing operative intervention as compared to nonoperative intervention.  (3)  

While this study considered all ankle fractures rather than specifically malleolar fractures, it demonstrates the importance of operative fixation as the primary treatment modality for elderly patients.  Our patient underwent operative fixation for an unstable fracture.  Unfortunately she was lost to follow up as she had to return to her home town shortly after her operation.
