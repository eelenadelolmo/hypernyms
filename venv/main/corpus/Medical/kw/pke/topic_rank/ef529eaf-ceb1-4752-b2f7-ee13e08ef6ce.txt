Vital Signs Normal and Stable
CARDIAC: no murmurs/rubs
LUNG: clear bilaterally
NECK/CHEST: no evidence of crepitus
Clinical observation to ensure stability.  Repeat imaging to track resolution of abnormality accomplished via CT scan a few weeks later.
• SOFT TISSUE NECK:  AP and lateral views of the soft tissue neck demonstrate abnormal linear lucency in the prevertebral soft tissues and surrounding the upper mediastinum consistent with pneumomediastinum.  Epiglottis and upper airway are normal in appearance.   No bony abnormality. 	
    	
 • CHEST X-RAY: PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate linear lucency anterior to the trachea, best appreciated on lateral view, consistent with pneumomediastinum.  Negative for pneumothorax.  Lungs are clear without consolidation.  No pleural effusion.  No acute or suspicious bony abnormality.

21 y.o. man, no prior medical or surgical history, presents with acute chest and neck pain that began while flying at 10,000 feet.  He c/o of a "bubble" feeling in his chest.
This patient has a spontaneous pneumomediastinum probably from low air pressure (decompression) at altitude.  This patient had no history of recent instrumentation such as upper endoscopy, no illness that involved repetitive vomiting, and he had never before experienced a pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax that he knew of.

His symptoms of chest and neck pressure started abruptly at about 10,000 feet while he was in a pressurized transport aircraft, about two hours into the flight.  The aircraft landed as soon as it could after the patient expressed his concern to the aircraft commander.  He was evaluated the next morning and the radiographic images reported as per above.

He remained clinically stable and showed no evidence of a pneumothorax, and the  "bubble" sensation in his chest resolved within a few days.
