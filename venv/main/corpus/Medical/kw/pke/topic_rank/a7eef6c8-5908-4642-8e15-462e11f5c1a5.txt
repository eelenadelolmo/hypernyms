Congenital valvular obstruction in the posterior urethra in males is an important cause of urinary tract obstruction.  It is a common cause of end stage nephropathy in males.  These valves obstruct urinary flow during micturition leading to dilatation and elongation of the posterior urethra.  Secondary obstructive changes occur in the bladder, ureters and kidneys.  There is bladder hypertrophy and trabeculation with the development of diverticula and saccules.

Vesicoureteral reflux presents in 50% of patients with this anomaly with one third being unilateral.  Dilatation and tortuosity of the ureters often occur.  Renal parenchyma is reduced in higher grade conditions.  Affected kidneys demonstrate dysplasia and small size.  Function of the affected kidney is decreased varying upon severity.  

Posterior urethral valves are associated with higher grade obstructions and changes in the upper urinary tracts, kidneys and bladder.  Symptoms include oliguria, poor urinary stream or urinary retention.  Physical exam reveals abdominal distention and palpable abdominal masses.  Prenatal diagnosis is made with ultrasound demonstrating hydronephrosis, hydroureters, bladder wall thickening and posterior urethral dilatation.  Initial presentation includes urinary tract infections, urosepsis, urinary retention, hematuria, or renal failure.  

The vesicourethrogram is the preferred examination.  Dilation of the posterior urethra,  valves are visualized as radiolucent lines and there is an abrupt transition between the dilated and normal posterior urethra.    Ultrasonography demonstrates a thickened bladder wasll with a dilated bilateral renal collecting system.

Prognosis is improved with any mechanism that relieves increased pressure in the urinary system.  Examples of these include, unilateral VUR, large bladder, diverticuli of the calyces, or ascites in utero.
