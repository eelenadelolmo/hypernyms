Treatment usually consists of chemotherapy with alkylating agents and induces remission in 50 to 70 percent of patients.  However, median survival is 3 years. Those with multiple lesions rarely survive longer than a year.  New therapies include peripheral stem cell transplants in combination with the traditional chemotherapy regimen. This combined therapy has induced remission in 50 percent of patients.  Complications such as recurrent infections, pathologic fractures, and renal failure are common.
