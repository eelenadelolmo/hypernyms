Because the patient is not a good surgical candidate and that the GIST has been relatively stable for the past 5 years, periodic follow up is all that is planned.
Fluoroscopic imaging:
-very abrupt, well-defined borders with adjacent mucosal folds that fade out at the periphery.
-normal area gastricae pattern can often be seen overlying these lesions.
-smooth surface when viewed on profile.
-borders often form right angles or obtuse angles with adjacent gastric wall

CT:
-large, heterogeneous, and exophytic.
-often demonstrate evidence of ulceration or necrosis at presentation.  
-calcification is not uncommon.  
-CT features associated with malignancy include size greater than 5cm and central necrosis.
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor
Leiomyoma
Leiomyosarcoma

This case nicely demonstrates the fluoroscopic appearance of submucosal lesions in the stomach.  The CT unfortunately was a non-contrast exam through the chest which does not optimally show the lesion.   Because the patient is not a good surgical candidate and that the GIST has been relatively stable for the past 5 years, periodic follow up is all that is planned.
