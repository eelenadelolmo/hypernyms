Following administration of barium contrast, the second portion of the duodenum remained mildy dilated, and there was an abrupt vertically oriented linear termination of the third part of the duodenum just right of midline on the supine images, with no contrast passing distally despite several minutes of observation.  When the patient was placed in the prone position, the image remained essentially unchanged, but a small trickle of contrast passed the obstruction.
