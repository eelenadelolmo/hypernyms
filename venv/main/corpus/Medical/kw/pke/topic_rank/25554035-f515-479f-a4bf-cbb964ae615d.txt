Extra-axial mass at the left CP angle, hypointense on T1, heterogeneous on T2 with avid enhancement on the postgadolinium images. Enhancing mass seen extending into (or out of) the internal auditory canal.  Focal area of nonenhancement likely represent cystic degeneration.  Positive mass effect on the left aspect of pons and fourth ventricle.
Vestibular ('Acoustic') Schwannoma
Vestibular Schwannoma
Unlikely considerations would include:
Meningioma and Epidermoid
Patient has sensorineural hearing loss, L > R
