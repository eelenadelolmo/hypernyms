64 yo gentleman who presents with 6 months of dysphagia to solids.  He did smoke, but quit 20 yrs ago.  He denies more than social drinking.  Admits to occasional esophageal reflux.
Adenocarcinoma is increasing in frequency.  Dysphagia should be evaluated with an upper GI, which is an easily performed test.  

Esophageal carcinoma spreads fairly quickly as the esophagus does not have a serosal membrane.
