Patient went to surgery to correct duodenal perforation.
CT may reveal extraluminal air or fluid. Air is seen in the wall of the duodenum with pneumatosis. Perforation usually occurs posterior to the pancreatic head, and there is localized air or fluid between the pancreatic head and duodenum. The free air is in the anterior pararenal space and right perirenal space at CT. It can track around the inferior vena cava and mesenteric vessels. There may be associated pneumoperitoneum, pneumomediastinum, and pneumothorax. Thickening of the duodenum, periduodenal fluid, and fluid collections may also be observed.  Periduodenal fluid due to leakage of bile and intestinal contents can progress to abscess formation.
ERCP complication: perforation of the duodenum.
Given visualization of free retroperitoneal air, no differential is needed.
44 year old female status post ERCP 8 hours earlier complaining of increasing mid epigastric pain.
This case nicely demonstrates the subtle plain film finding of free retroperitoneal air and confirmation with CT.  With the given history of recent ERCP, this is diagnostic of duodenal perforation.
