L5-S1 right radiculopathy on neurologic testing.
surgical intervention
T1 and T2 weighted sagittal and axial images exhibit a right posterior and superiorly extruded intervertebral disc, exerting significant mass effect on the right S1 nerve root.
L5-S1 right para-centrally extruded disc
Extruded disc 
Epidural hematoma or abscess
Scar
HIV patient with worsening right sided radicular symptoms.
This represents an extrusion which impinges significantly on the right nerve root of S1, but without sequestration evident on this study. This was an acute, non-traumatic exacerbation of a chronic degenerative process.
