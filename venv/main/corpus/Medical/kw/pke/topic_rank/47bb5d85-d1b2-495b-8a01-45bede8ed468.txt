Plain films read as normal (unavailable).
Questionable soft tissue mass, poorly appreciated, just superior to calcaneal insertion of gastrocnemius on involved side.
surgical repair, progressive PT and re-mobilization
T1 MRI sagittal image suggests incomplete (partial) rupture of achilles tendon, with little or no soft tissue deformity. T2 MRI sag image confirms complete tear of tendon (confirmed in other T2 sag cuts)with abnormal hyperintense signal intervening between the proximal and distal tendon fragments.
Achilles Tendon Rupture
achilles tendinosis
partial avulsion
Sudden acceleration in preparation for marathon resulted in significant left posterior supra-calcaneal pain and antalgic gait.
This represents a complete tear in the typical to slightly older age male group, post trauma. T2 image most helpful in positively identifying complete vs. partial tear of the gastrocnemius tendon.
