Decreased breath sounds on auscultation of the left lung.
Pleural space decompression and chest tube placement.  Follow-up imaging obtained to rule out pneumothorax recurrence, chest tube placement, and development of infection.
Single frontal view of the chest shows large left pneumothorax resulting in deviation of the trachea and mediastinum to the right.
Tension Pneumothorax
Tension pneumothorax 
Non-tension pneumothorax

In considering etiologies for pneumothorax, include
Spontaneous/idiopathic
Traumatic, including barotrauma
Underlying malignancy
Infection, such as TB
Ruptured bulla
Catamenial (due to endometriosis involving the thoracic cavity)
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)
Shortness of breath recently.
Tension pneumothorax develops from a one-way valve mechanism following chest wall or lung injury.  Gas enters the pleural space, but does not escape.  As a result, intrapleural pressure rises.  The increased pressure collapses the ipsilateral lung and forces it towards the contralateral side.  Mediastinal shift compromises gas exchange, as well as venous return to the heart.  If the condition progresses, the contralateral lung is also compressed and respiratory function is further compromised.  As a result, immediate treatment is required.

Patients with tension pneumothorax typically present following trauma.  However, the condition can occur spontaneously.  Patients also present with tachypnea, dyspnea, decreased breath sounds on auscultation, hyperresonance of the affected side, hypotension, and rarely a detectable shift of the trachea to the opposite side.  Chest films provide confirmation of the diagnosis.  However, tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis, and treatment should not be delayed in order to obtain images if clinically diagnosed. 

Treatment involves immediate decompression of the pleural space.  There are several ways to achieve decompression.  A large-bore needle or a scalpel blade can be inserted into the pleural space at the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line.  Insertion can also occur at the fourth to fifth intercostal space anterior to the midaxillary line.  These techniques usually result in audible decompression of the pleural space and immediate respiratory improvement.  A chest tube is then inserted.
