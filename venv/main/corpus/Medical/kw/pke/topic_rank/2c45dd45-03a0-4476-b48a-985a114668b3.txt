The patient's right breast was notably larger than the left, with a markedly palpable mass at 12 o'clock.  The breast was warm and the upper half of the breast was erythematous.  The patient had been on antibiotics for approximately 5 days at the time of the mammogram.
The patient is now being evaluated for treatment.  A PET scan confirmed the findings of the CT exam, showing a large right breast mass with regional lymph nodes with hypermetabolic activity.  There was no evidence of another primary source.
The mammogram (MLO view provided, as the copy of the CC view was of poor quality) demonstrates a large (3cm) round mass with well circumscribed margins.  Multiple small pleomorphic calcifications were seen within the mass.  The CT exam shows the corresponding mass in the right breast, as well as a large abnormal right axillary lymph node.  There were other nodes noted in the supraclavicular area (not shown).  There were no lung masses.

As stated in the factoid, primary small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the breast is extremely rare.
