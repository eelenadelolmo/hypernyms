Examination: 5 mm firm cystic nodule on right nasal ala. No other significant skin findings.
Course: The lesion was excised.
Histopathology: The biopsy shows normal epidermis overlying a proliferation of numerous radiating sebaceous lobules. Small amounts of rudimentary hair structures and apocrine glands are present within the proliferation. The pilosebaceous units are embedded in a mesenchymal stroma composed of fibrous, adipose, vascular and neural tissue. Immunohistochemical stains for S-100 showed staining of numerous stellate, spindle and dendritic cells in the intervening myxoid stroma. Several of these spindle and dendritic cells also stain for factor XIIIA
