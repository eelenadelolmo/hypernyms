HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI
MOTOR: Strength on right 0/5 strength in both upper and lower extremities. Strength on left  5/5 in upper and lower extremities
SPEECH: Patient is aphasic
Neurosurgery contacted to monitor increasing brain edema. Standard stroke workup- TCD, TTE with bubble study, PT/OT, patient started on Asa 325mg qd, and Lipitor 20mg qhs
On CT- there is early evidence of ischemic infarction in the left hemisphere along with a hyperdense MCA sign in the Left MCA.

MRI demonstrates a massive left cerebral infarction, including  infarction of the left frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes with involvement of the basal ganglia but sparing of the thalamus is present. No right sided abnormality.
Massive left hemisphere stroke
1) Stroke: Ischemic vs Hemorrhagic
2) Abcess/infection
3) Tumor
61y/o male with no prior past medical history who presented with right sided weakness and difficulty speaking for unknown duration
This patient suffered a massive cerebrovascular accident, that caused ischemia to most of cortex in the left hemisphere. Due to the massive nature of the patient's stroke, there was significant concern about cerebral edema and possible herniation, which is why neurosurgery was contacted to help monitor the patient and perform a hemicraniectomy if warranted to prevent brain herniation

In addition, the initial non-contrast head CT, showed an early sign of ischemia known as the hyperdense MCA sign, caused by an acute thrombus in the vasculature.
