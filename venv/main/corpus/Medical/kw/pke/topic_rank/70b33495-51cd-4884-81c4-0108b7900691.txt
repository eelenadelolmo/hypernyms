Surgical therapy 
1. Open treatment -Lesions may be treated by curettage and packing with freeze-dried, crushed, cortical-bone allograft.
2. Percutaneous procedures - Steroids are percutaneously instilled within UBCs.
Well-defined, slightly expansile, lytic lesion in the mid-diaphysis of the left humerus.  There is a narrow zone of transition with endosteal scalloping.  Cortical irregularity is seen through its mid-aspect consistent with fracture.  A periosteal reaction is noted at the fracture site.  A cortical fragment is seen "within" this cystic lesion and may represent a "fallen fragment"
Unicameral Bone Cyst with Pathologic Fracture
14 y/o suffered a fall on outstretched hand (FOOSH) and complains of pain
UBC is very common in the proximal humeral metaphysis.  A metaphyseal lesion can be described as active.  A lesion of the diaphysis has been called latent and is no longer growing.
