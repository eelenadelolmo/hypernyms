Axial contrast-enhanced CT images reveal a large, mildly heterogeneous, enhancing right hilar mass that measures 7.2cm AP.  No distinct calcification or necrosis is appreciated, no other masses or nodules are appreciated. The mass exerts minimal compressive effect on the superior vena cava and right atrium.
Castleman Disease
Broad differential for asymmetric hilar lymphadenopathy includes infection (tuberculosis or other granulomatous/infectious causes), primary or metastatic lung cancer, metastatic disease, lymphoma, sarcoidosis, inflammatory pneumoconioses, collagen vascular disease, reactive hyperplasia
50yo man presents for follow-up of his "Castleman disease, hyaline vascular variant".  No prior studies are available.
If the mass continues to grow, it could compress the right atrium/SVC and result in superior vena cava syndrome, so continued monitoring was recommended.
