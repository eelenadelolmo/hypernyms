Brachytherapy seed embolization to the pulmonary arteries is a frequent occurance.  Patients should be informed of the phenomenon in case a question comes up on a future radiologic exam.  The tiny metallic seeds may be mistaken for aspirated metallic foreign bodies, or for schrapnel (which would be of more irregular shape).  But given the characteristic rod-like shape, identical to that found within the prostatic bed, the diagnosis is sealed.
