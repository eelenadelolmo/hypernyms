The patient was treated with antibiotics and drainage of the lesion.  Serial US exams demonstrate thickening/fibrosis of the abscess wall over time with decrease in overall size.  The patient continues to show gradual clinical improvement.  Treatment of pyogenic liver abscess typically requires drainage and 4-6 weeks of IV antibiotics.
CT imaging demonstrates large cystic structure with area of low attenuation centrally and apparent fluid level, with a discrete, enhancing wall.  US demonstrates a thickened, irregular wall with central area of heterogeneous echogenicity, representing the liquefaction of the abscess.
