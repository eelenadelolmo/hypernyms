60 year-old man with enlarged liver by physical exam.
Initial biopsy revealed that the tumor cells are strongly positive for CD20 and focally positive for CD99; but negative for cytokeratin, S100, and mesenchymal markers consistent with atypical B-cell Lymphoma.

Follow-up flow cytometry revealed that predominant cell population are B-cells expressing CD45, CD20 (bright), CD19, CD10, FMC-7 and CD38.  The kappa to lambda ratio is greater than 1:100, lambda light chain restricted.  They are negative for CD34, CD5, and CD23. Differential diagnosis includes Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma and Burkitt's Lymphoma.
