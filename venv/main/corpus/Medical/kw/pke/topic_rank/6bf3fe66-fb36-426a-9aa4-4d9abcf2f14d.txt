On physical exam, the patient's colostomy site was noted to be erythematous and tenderness to palpation. Laboratory tests were significant for an elevated white blood cell count.
Renal ectopia required no treatment but underlying periumbilical infection dictated treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics with possible surgical drainage.
CT revealed ill-defined mixture of soft tissue and air in the periumbilical region in the post-operative site. This in combination with the patient's history and physical exam are highly suggestive of an infection. 

The notable other finding on CT scan was the absence of a kidney in the right retroperitoneal space.  Further inspection, however, revealed two left kidneys but also a distal right ureter with normal bladder insertion.
Crossed Fused Renal Ectopia
The differential of an absent retroperitoneal kidney.
1) Congenital absence of the kidney
2) S/P nephrectomy
3) Renal ectopia (pelvic kidney, crossed fused ectopia, intrathoracic kidney)
History of diverticulitis with recent removal of sigmoid colon and colostomy.  No history of urologic complaints or problems.
CT scan of abdomen indicates the absence of a right retroperitoneal kidney.  Closer inspection reveals the presence of a two left kidneys and two distal ureters (one right and one left).  Of note the right ureter can be traced back from the bladder and noted to cross midline to one of the left kidneys.  These findings are characteristic for a crossed fused renal ectopia.  A potential differential consideration when finding two left kidneys would be that of a duplex kidney but in this case both ureters would remain on the same side and not cross midline.
