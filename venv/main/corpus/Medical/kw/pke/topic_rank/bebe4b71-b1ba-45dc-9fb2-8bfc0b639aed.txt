Remarkable findings:
Heart/vasculature:
•Blood pressure: 151/72
•Pulse: 85 bpm
•Prominent and pulsatile right carotid
•Regular rate/rhythm with 2 to 3 x 6 diastolic murmur
Continue regular visits with cardiologist and primary care physician.
•MRI Heart w/contrast

Remarkable findings:
•Mildly dilated LV; normal systolic function, EF 70%
•Moderate aortic regurgitation with flow quantitiation showing regurgitant fraction of 25%
•Aortic root and ascending aorta are diffusely dilated; aortic dilation extends up to aortic arch
•Brachiocephalic trunk is aneurismal measuring maximally at 2.5cm
•Ectasia also involves proximal portion of right common carotid artery
•Left common carotid artery has fusiform aneurysms in proximal segment before bifurcation
•Subclavian artery has a high-grade stenosis immediately after origin of left internal mammary artery
•Some pericardial effusion
•Moderately dilated main pulmonary artery

Late gadolinium enhancement:
•Subepicardial myocardial enhancement off inferior and inferolateral wall
•No myocardial infarction
