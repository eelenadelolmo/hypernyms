Texto: 
Palpable, mildly tender subcutaneous mass on the plantar aspect of the foot, at the base of the first MTP joint.  Mild overlying erythema. Otherwise healthy male.  No recallable history of antecedent trauma.
Treatment consists of wide excision; some advocate post surgical radiation to help prevent recurrence.
2cm x 3cm well-circumscribed fusiform mass arising from the plantar fascia on the medial aspect of the foot proximal to the 1st MTP.  Lesion is homogenously iso-intense to muscle on T1 sequences, and hetrogenslightly hyperintense on fat-saturated T2 sequences.  Marked, homogeneous enhancement following administration of gadolinium DTPA.  No surrounding soft tissue or bone marrow edema.
Plantar Fibromatosis (Ledderhose Disease)
Plantar Fibromatosis
Nodular (Pesudosarcomatous)Fasciitis
Aggressive Fibromatosis
Enlarging mass on medial plantar aspect of his foot, becomming increasingly sypmpomatic over last 2 weeks.
Location and imaging characteristics are classic for this entity of superficial fibromatosis.  Nodular fasciitis is a differential consideration, but only involves the feet in ~15% of cases, being mostly found in the upper body and trunk.  About 50% of plantar fibromas are painful.  Lesions are not related to trauma and are of uncertain etiology.  Lesions can be bilateral in up to 50% and can also involve the palmar fascia (Dupuytren's Contracture). Treatment with excision must include the entire lesion, and similiar to other fibromatoses, lesions tend to recurr.  Not locally destructive as the deep (aggressive) fibromatoses(desmoid).
