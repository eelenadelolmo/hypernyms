The intussusception was transient and not clinically appreciated.

Depending on the clinical management plan of the patient, PET Scan or CT Enterography were suggested regarding the metastatic RCC.
In addition to metastatic disease to the lungs and liver, the patient was found to have enlarged mesenteric nodes and probable metastases to the small bowel that were serving as lead points for multiple occurrences of intussusception.  Classic target sign is noted in the axial view.
Intussusception secondary to metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the small bowel.
The target sign is classic for intussusception, but there are a multitude of causes, which are dependent on age group:

• Gastrointestinal malignancy (most common in adults)
• Meckel diverticulum
• Infection (Peyer's Patches)
• intestinal polyps and lipomas
• Burkitt lymphoma
• Ectopic pancreas
62 y.o. man with intermittent abdominal pain and cramping.  PMH of abdominal surgery.
