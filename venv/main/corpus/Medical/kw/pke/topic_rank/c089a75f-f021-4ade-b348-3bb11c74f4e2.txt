25 y/o WM in acute renal failure after intense exercise session
Imaging generally does not play a role in management of rhabdomyolysis, other than to rule out obstructive hydronephrosis and assess renal size.  

Although the imaging findings are non-specific, correlation with clinical history is the key to diagnosis.
