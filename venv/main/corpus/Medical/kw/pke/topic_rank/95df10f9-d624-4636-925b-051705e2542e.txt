painful draining ulcer right great toe
plain films:  show destruction of tuft of distal phalanx great toe, with gradual decrease in mineralization over several month period.

Tc99m-MDP bone scan: increased uptake on flow, pool, delayed and 24 hour delayed images in the region of the distal phalanx, right great toe. 

In-111 tagged WBC scan:  concordant increased uptake in the region of the right 1st distal phalanx in comparison with 24 hour delayed bone scan images.

MRI:  decreased T1 signal, increased T2 signal, enhancement with gadolinium within the bone (not just adjacent soft tissues).
osteomyelitis
*osteomyelitis is by far the most likely diagnosis
*seronegative spondyloarthropathy (reactive or psoriatic arthritis)- may involve phalangeal tufts
