Physical Exam:
• HEART:  Sinus tachycardia
• LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
• ABDOMEN: nondistended, nontender 

Lab results to note:
• hemoglobin: 8.3 (below normal)
• normal cardiac enzyme evaluation
• guaiac positive stool

• ECG: sinus tachycardia
• Echocardiogram: flattened septum consistent with right ventricular pressure overload, mild-to-moderate right ventricular hypertrophy
Follow up with primary care physician and cardiologist.
• No acute or chronic pulmonary embolism
• Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return from the left upper lobe to the left brachiocephalic vein
• Enlargement of the pulmonary artery
Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return
This imaging findings using this modality are pathomnemonic
A 76 year old man complains of shortness of breath with minimal physical activity.  

PMH includes episodic atrial fibrillation, type II diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, iron-deficiency anemia, and colon cancer status post right hemicolectomy.
Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return is a rare congenital condition in which pulmonary venous return feeds into systemic venous return. PAPVR is mostly reported originating from the right upper lobe; however, this patient has PAPVR from the left upper lobe.
