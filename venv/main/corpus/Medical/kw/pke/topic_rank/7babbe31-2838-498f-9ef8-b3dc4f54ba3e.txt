Asbestos Pleural Plaques
Virtually pathognomomic of asbestosis exposure
differential considerations include:
talc exposure
prior hemothorax, empyema
therapeutic pneumothorax for TB

This is an advaced calcification with leaflike and thick rolled edges.

Typically, plaques spare the lung apices and costophrenic angles.  Pleural plaques are unilateral in 25% of cases.
