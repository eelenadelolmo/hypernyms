Asymptomatic Persistent Left Superior Vena Cava
Persistent Left Superior Vena Cava
The following complications were entertained: intra-arterial line placement (unlikely), penetration of the vein wall, and persistent left superior vena cava.
3 mo AAF with aqueductal stenosis, subsequent hydronephrosis and ventriculo-peritoneal shunt placement admitted for VP shunt infection and IV abx.  PICC line was placed in the NICU, with a left arm cut-down and chest radiograph to confirm placement.  No pulsatile blood or high-pressure back-flow was noted, the minimal blood seen was dark, and the vessel cannulated was by consensus venous.  Atypical placement of the PICC line was noted on the left side of the heart.  The child was born at NNMC in Bethesda, MD and the report of a post-natal echocardiogram was obtained which confirmed the presence of a persistent LSVC, with no other cardiac abnormalities.
