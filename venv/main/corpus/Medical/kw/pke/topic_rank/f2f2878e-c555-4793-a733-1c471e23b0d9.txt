right nephrectomy path:
    The neoplasm measures 13 x 12 x 7 cm and appears encapsulated.
    The cut surface is soft with solid, cystic and necrotic areas.  The
    remainder of the kidney is grossly unremarkable. Grossly, the neoplasm
    appears not to involve the renal pelvis or the renal sinus.
Heterogeneous soft tissue mass that on CT demonstrates a "claw sign", distinguishing the mass as arising from the right kidney.  In addition, this is associated multiple pulmonary nodules.
Wilms Tumor
Wilm's tumor (Nephroblastoma)
Renal cell carcinoma
Neuroblastoma - if the mass was not recognized as renal in origin and thought to be adrenal in origin.

While cases of Renal cell carcinoma have been reported as young as 8 years old, in a 3 year old, nephroblastoma is the most common cause for a renal mass.  Neuroblastomas, also a common tumor in this age group, would demonstrate origin from outside the kidney.  Wilm's tumor metastasis to the lungs is also not uncommon where as Neuroblastoma is less likely to metastasize to lung, also helping to differentiate the masses.
