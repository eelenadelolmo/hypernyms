44 year old man presents with one week history of paresthesia, ataxia and slurred speech.
Brainstem gliomas are quite unusual in adults.
Most such lesions are not anaplastic and typically present in children.  The new WHO classification (2007) indicates that any vascular changes upgrade the neoplasm from anaplastic to GBM.  Thus, contrast enhancement should be viewed as a very ominous finding.
