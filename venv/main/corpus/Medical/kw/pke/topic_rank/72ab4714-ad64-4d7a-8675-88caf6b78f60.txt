Surgical removal followed by radiation therapy
High right parietal lobe mass with surrounding edema.
The lesion is adjacent to superior sagittal sinus without invasion.  There is relatively homogeneous contrast enhancement - but without a "dural tail" sign.
Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)
• Astrocytoma
• Meningioma
• Hemangiopericytoma
• Metastatic lesion
61 year old man with a 2 week history of right arm and leg numbness.  A CT scan had been done at an outside hospital (not available today) that was abnormal.
The preoperative MRI was thought to show an extraaxial lesion most consisten with meningioma,  rather than an intraaxial lesion (e.g. metastasis or glioma).

This lesion is difficult localize into either the intra-axial or extra-axial space.  It also has signal intensities more suggestive of a meningioma vs a glioma.  The lack of a dural tail may the best indication that this tumor is an intraaxial glioma - since up to 90% or more of meningiomas have a dural tail.
