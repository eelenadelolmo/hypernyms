Pertinant Positives: Subtle Left Facial Droop
The initial treatment of choice for Glioblastoma Multiforme is surgical resection with maximal preservation of neurological function. However, few if any patients are cured with surgery alone. Therefore, adjuvant focal external beam radiation therapy along with chemotherapy is usually added. The median survival rate with supportive care is 14wks, 20wks with resectionn alone, 36wks for surgery with radiation therapy, and 40-50wks with the addition of chemotherapy.
