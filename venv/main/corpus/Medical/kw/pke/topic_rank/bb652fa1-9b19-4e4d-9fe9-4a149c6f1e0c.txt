None required - continued followup of liver function
• No evidence of large intra-abdominal or thoracic hemorrhage.

• Postsurgical changes in the left chest wall compatible with recent placement of AICD (implanted cardiac defibrillator).

• Unchanged cardiomegaly.

• and, … a hyperdense liver!
Amiodarone Liver, increased attenuation (density) on CT
• Iron deposition
» Multiple blood transfusions, increased iron oral intake, ineffective erythropoiesis, primary hemochromatosis (congenital hemochromatosis)
• Glycogen storage diseases (Types I and IV)
• Gold therapy
• Wilson’s disease
• Thoratrast (contrast agent 1920s-1950s)
• Amiodarone therapy
54 y.o. woman with a long history of cardiac problems.  Currently an inpatient after an elective cardiac procedure.  CT scan ordered because of decreasing hemoglobin and hematocrit after cardiac procedure.
Normal liver attenuation, precontrast, is similar to spleen, but often slightly  greater (+10 HU) - reported to be about 55 (PMID: 10789806) to 63 HU (PMID:   1389665).    http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/reprint/174/5/1417

Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication -which this patient was taking.  Primary hepatic metabolism of amiodarone - and it is slowly excreted into bile by the liver.  Chronic amiodarone therapy increases hepatic parenchymal attenuation - even at normal/typical dosage without toxicity.  Normalization of liver attenuation takes weeks to months after discontinuation of the drug.
