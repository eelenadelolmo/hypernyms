Drainage of the abscess can be preformed but has as a high risk of causing the complication broncho-pleural fistula, which is very difficult to treat. Furthermore drainage of small pulmonary abscesses in young children who are clinically not in extremis is usually not necessary. These generally resolve with intravenous followed by oral antibiotic therapy. On the otherhand, drainage of the empyema is necessary as antibiotics will have no effect on the empyema
