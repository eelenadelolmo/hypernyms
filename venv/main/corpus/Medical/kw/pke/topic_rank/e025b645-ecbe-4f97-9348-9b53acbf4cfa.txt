Following the PET scan, the patient proceeded to excisional biopsy.  Frozen section was collected in the OR which did not show malignant features and the entire mass (along with AP window node) were removed.  Special stains were performed which showed focally hyalinized germinal centers, occasionally penetrated by blood vessels, consistent with the hyaline vascular variant of Castleman Disease.  Extensive flow cytometry was performed which proved that the tissue was not lymphoma.
1. Old CTA
-large right pulmonary artery embolism
-apices not imaged
2. New CTA
-clot resolved
-apices imaged - mass along the left aspect of trachea = ~10 x 3 x 2 cm
3. PET
-mass size corresponds to CT - significant activity (4.45 SUVs)
-other regions at base of neck correspond to brown fat
-single focus of high activity in AP window likely node
Castleman Disease - Hyaline Vascular Variant
Lymphoma
Tuberculosis
Castleman Disease
Exophytic thyroid nodule
Thymoma
42 year-old with history of large PE treated with anticoagulation for 6 months.  Now with recurrent chest pain.  ER requests reassessment of clot burden.
Given that the pathological diagnosis is hyaline vascular variant, the patient will likely be cured by this single intervention.  It is unlikely that her Castleman Disease was related to her symptoms, however, this cases demonstrates that the previous standard method of performing CTA can lead to missed diagnoses as the lung apices are not imaged.  Given the speed of modern scanner and the presence of fan-beam geometry, scans of the entire chest can now be performed without significant radiation increase.
