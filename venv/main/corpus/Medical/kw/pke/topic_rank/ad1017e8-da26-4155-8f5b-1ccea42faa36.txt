Conservative treatment initially, to be followed by surgery if the symptoms fail to remit.
Sagittal and axial T2 images reveal asymmetric diskovertebral degenerative changes at L5-S1, with disk dessication and narrowing at this level.  More significantly, there is a large left paramedian disk extrusion at this level, measuring 2.3cm cc x 1.7cm transverse x 1.2cm AP, which displaces the left S1 nerve root posteriorly. The extruded disk results in moderate left neural foraminal stenosis.
