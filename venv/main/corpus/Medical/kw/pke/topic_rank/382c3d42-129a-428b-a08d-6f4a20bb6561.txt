There is a soft tissue lesion superior to the left ear. Otherwise the patient is alert, active, and in no acute distress. The rest of the physical exam is within normal limits. 

Labs were significant for an elevated sedimentation rate and peripheral eosinophilia @ 7%. CBC, CMP, and Iron studies were within normal limits.
A port was placed by general surgery for chemotherapy infusions. He was placed on prednisone, and received his first course of vinblastine prior to discharge, as well as 6MP oral maintenance. 

After several months, his bony lesions were resolving and showed evidence of healing. 

However, his vertebra plan was persistent. His follow up lung CT showed improvement of lung cystic lesions with minimal residual changes.
-Head CT w IV contrast demonstrated 3 areas of bone destruction in the skull with associated enhancing soft tissue. The largest is in the right parietal bone above the squamosal suture. The additional areas of involvement include the greater wing of the sphenoid on the right and the left posterior parietal bone.

-Skeletal survey revealed lytic skull lesions, L3 vertebral body completely collapsed and sclerosis, an erosive lytic lesion in the patient"s right 6 anterolateral rib along the anterior surface, and evidence of expansion of the patient"s left sixth anterolateral rib. 

-Bone scan revealed multiple foci of increased uptake within the skull, ribs bilaterally. There is heterogeneous uptake within the thoracic and lumbar spine which may represent small lesions as well. The area of vertebra plana at L4 is also demonstrated.

-Chest AP plain film demonstrated prominent markings, at least partially due to low lung volumes.

-Chest CT w IV contrast revealed multiple cystic lesions with nodules throughout both lungs and also scattered patchy areas of groundglass opacity bilaterally. There were also lytic lesions within 
several posterior lateral ribs bilaterally and there is vertebra plana 
at the level of T8.
Langerhans cell histiocytosis
metastatic bone disease 
leukemia 
lymphoma 
 
multifocal osteomyelitis (less likely)
The patient is a 13 month old boy, with a history of prematurity at 25 weeks gestation, who presented to his primary care provider after his mother noticed a soft tissue mass over his left ear. The patient is not complaining of pain or tenderness. He has no other significant medical or surgical history.
Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disease, and lung involvement is even more infrequent - occurring in approximately 10 percent of cases. Furthermore, when the lungs are involved it is typically seen in adult smokers, and is very infrequently found in children.
