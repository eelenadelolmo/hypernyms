Left Tubal Ectopic Pregnancy

Tubal ectopic pregnancy.
Intra-abdominal ectopic.
Several hours of cramping abdominal pain with positive pregnancy home test.
True ovarian pregnancy represents less than 1% of all ectopic pregnancies. This was a live fetus measured (by CRL) at 7 weeks, 4 days EGA.  While the initial thought was that this may represent a ovarian ectopic as the implant was unable to be seperated from the ovary, surgically and pathology demonstrated that it was tubal in location.
