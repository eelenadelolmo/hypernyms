Quadraplegia
Placement of a IVC filter.
Ultrasound examination of the right lower extremity demonstrates a linear intraluminal echogenic area located in the common femoral vein. No acoustic shadowing deep to the area. These findings are suggestive of a small non- occlusive thrombus of indeterminate age.
