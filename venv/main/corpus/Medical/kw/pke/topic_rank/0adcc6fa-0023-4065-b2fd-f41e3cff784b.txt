Patient will receive continued imaging and clinical follow-up; she is currently asymptomatic.
Repaired Coarctation of the Aorta.  Four contiguous double inversion recovery fast spin echo magnetic resonance (MR) images in LAO (”candy cane”) projection show an area of narrowing at the level of the proximal descending thoracic aorta, the site of the patient’s surgical repair.  At the point of maximal narrowing, the aorta measures 13mm. 

Bright blood (SSFP) MR images in LAO and a tangential oblique coronal plane through the region of the coarctation repair shows no evidence of a flow jet, which if present suggests a hemodynamically significant coarctation.

Bright blood (fast GRE) MR image in LAO projection shows no evidence of a flow jet.
Aortic coarctation repair; postsurgical imaging
