- 24 SEPT 2003 - No physical exam performed prior to her routine ultrasound. 
- 25 SEPT 2003 - ABD - Nontender, normal BS. No palpable masses. PELVIC (BIMANUAL) Palpable mass in left adnexa.
- 12 NOV 2003 - Follow up ultrasound.
- 11 DEC 2003 - MRI Pelvis.
Torsion is a worry given the size of the mass and surgical resection is a possibility despite benign histology.
- 24 SEPT 2003 Ultrasound:
1) Complex L adnexal cyst: a) Mixed echogenicity, b) smooth inner wall structure, c) no septations, d) thin outer wall. (Presence of true through-transmission is equivocal; any through-transmission appreciated may be from the adjacent bladder). No flow is demonstrated on Doppler interrogation. 

- 12 NOV 2003 Ultrasound:
1) Complex left adnexal cyst/mass: No interval change in size. Interval increase in echogenicity (same internal echoes as uterus). Origin indeterminate.

- 11 DEC 2003 - MRI:
1) Single representative T2 axial and T2 sagittal images demonstrate an extrauterine, left adnexal mass of homoogeneous signal character. It is well-circumscribed and non-aggressive in appearance. The left ovary not appreciated on any sequence. 

Biopsy-driven diagnosis.
COMPLEX OVARIAN CYST PRESENTATION OF OVARIAN FIBROMA
Radiographic diagnosis:
1) Hemorrhagic cyst
2) Ovarian Mass - Benign (Fibroma, Dermoid) and Malignant (Germ Cell and Stromal Cell tumors)
3) Abscess
4) Endometrioma
5) Subserosal, exophytic uterine fibroid
6) Non-gynecologic mass
7) Hydro-, Pyo- salpinx
8) Ovarian torsion
15 year old female with caudal regression for routine annual renal ultrasound.
Consistent with FACTOID discussion, this mass, suspicious for a complex ovarian cyst, was followed in 6 weeks time. With no interval regression and no identifiable origin, cross-sectional imaging was imperative. Despite imaging, differential could not be narrowed significantly though the mass' imaging characteristics were more re-assuring for a benign-type process. Definitive diagnosis in this case was histologic.
