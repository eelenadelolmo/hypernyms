Labs:
PTH = 85.1  (normal range:  13-65)
Ca++ = 10.9  (normal range:  8.4-10.2)
Vit D = normal
Surgical excision, follow-up labs to ensure normalization
-Early images:  small  focus of increased radiotracer accumulation at the left lower thyroid region, which appears extraglandular

-Late images:  appropriate thyroid washout with the focus of increased radiotracer accumulation at the left lower thyroid region, now more evident
Parathyroid adenoma:  Probable - pending surgical confirmation
1)  Parathyroid adenoma

2)  Less likely an exophytic thyroid adenoma
 
3)  Thyroidal or extrathyroidal malignancy, lymphoma, etc
56 y/o male with recurrent kidney stones and elevated PTH.
Early images  (“Thyroid phase”) 
-prominent thyroid uptake, also salivary glands 
-often can see focal uptake in parathyroid adenoma

Delayed images  (“Parathyroid phase”)  
-most of thyroid uptake has washed out 
-a focal area of residual activity (adenoma) or multiple foci of activity (hyperplasia or multiple adenomas) will be seen

Sensitivity for 300 mg adenomas is approx 85-90%
-False negative:  small size and lower sensitivity for hyperplasia (50-60%).
-False positive:  most common is a thyroid adenoma.
