Secondary to persistent severe headaches and as part of a research protocol, the patient underwent an MRI which demonstrated a densely enhancing lesion in the region of the pineal gland.

An angiogram was performed to exclude a vascular malformation.
Angiographic images demonstrate a 1.3 cm aneurysm arising from the distal/peripheral aspect of the left posterior cerebral artery.  There was no shunting of blood through the lesion / early venous visualization and no additional feeding vessels.  Also, the adjacent vein of Galen and Straight Sinus are normal in appearance.
Aneurysm
Aneurysm
The patient is a 34 y/o white man who presented with headaches and hypertension.
Aneurysms peripheral to the circle of Willis are relatively rare and are usually secondary to infection or trauma.  No etiology was identified in this patient.  Peripheral aneurysms, when present, are not uncommonly multiple and usually present secondary to spontaneous hemmorhage.  Please see the other case discussions of aneurysm already submitted on MedPix.
