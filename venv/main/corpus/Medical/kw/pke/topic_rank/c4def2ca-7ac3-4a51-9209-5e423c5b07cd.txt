In most instances pain is the only adverse effect of the tumor.  Aspirin and NSAIDs can be used if surgery is not an option.  Rarely is there are secondary pathologic consequences in young children with spine or joint oriented tumors.  But, because the pain itself can be disabling and spontaneous regression over years is unpredictable, operative treatment is often recommended.  Most recently radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has gained acceptance as the treatment of choice for this condition.  It has replaced open surgery because it has far fewer complications and a much shorter recovery period.  

Generally this procedure is performed under spinal or local anesthetic and the lesion is identified under CT guidance.  Once the electrode is introduced into the lesion it is heated up to 85-90 degrees Celsius for 6 minutes and then withdrawn.   Patients treated with RFA are usually pain free within 2-3 days and are advised to avoid running or jumping for 3 months.
