Texto: 
- Initially, the biloma was percutaneously drained.
- An ERCP was performed by GI, and a stent was placed to facilitate the drainage of bile into small bowel.
STUDY: Hepatobiliary Scan.

History:  Continued RUQ pain, rising bilirubin, and continued ileus after right liver lobectomty for HCC.

RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 8.0 mCi of Tc-99m hepatolite V. 

FINDINGS: There is prompt uptake by the liver followed by increased radiotracer activity which tracks along the liver margin.

IMPRESSION:  The above findings are consistent with a biliary leak.
Biliary leak
The patient is a 51 year-old woman with a past medical history significant for Hepatitis B.  The patient was found to have HCC by CT abdomen.  The patient subsequently underwent a partial right liver lobectomy and cholecystectomy.  On follow-up CT, the surgical margin was positive for residual tumor, and after undergoing embolization in special procedures, the patient had a completion lobectomy.
