On examination, she had terminal neck stiffness, sluggishly reacting right pupil, left hemiparesis, left upper motor neuron facial palsy, and right sided optic atrophy.

Investigations showed anaemia and raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed an infarct involving  the right middle cerebral artery region , thick enhancing exudates along the cortical sulci and basal cisterns, and features suggestive of tuberculous meningitis 

MRI also showed a 2 cm x 1.8 cm x 1.8 cm mass in the supra-sellar cistern which was isointense on T1 weighted images and hypointense on T2 weighted and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images (Figure 2). Hypointensity on T2 weighted imaging is characteristic of caseous necrotic content.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed 5 cells (100% lymphocytes), 20 mg/dl proteins, and 45 mg/dl of glucose. CSF adenosine deaminase (ADA) level was 22 U/L (Normal <10U/L). Immunoglobulin M (IgM) for anti-A60 antigen was positive. 

Cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leutinising hormone (LH), prolactin, T3, T4, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were within normal limits.

The above clinical, laboratory, and MRI findings were suggestive of a tuberculoma; however, a malignancy had to be reliably ruled out. In view of her pregnant state, magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed in lieu of transnasal suprasellar biopsy.

MR spectroscopy revealed a prominent lipid peak at 1.3 ppm, typical of a tuberculoma (Figures 3 and 4).

Anti-tuberculous drugs and intravenous steroids were started. There was marked clinical improvement over the following weeks. She was discharged and advised regular physiotherapy and follow-up with repeat MRI after 3 months
MRI reveals suprasellar mass lesion which is isointense on T1 W images and hypointense on T2 W images with enahncing exudateds along cortical sulci and in sylvian fissure with vasculitis - ischemic changes in right basal ganglion.

A 20 year old woman presented with sudden onset depressed sensorium and left sided weakness. She was 20 weeks pregnant and had a 6 month history of low grade fever and occasional vomiting. She had no past history of gastric or esophageal disorder, tuberculosis, diabetes, or any other major illness.
