The labs actually suggest a possible mixed in component of focal pyelonepritis.  He underwent treatment for both and has done very well recovering from his Aortic repair.
Ultrasound was performed of the kidneys.  The left kidney demonstrates a hypoechoic soft tissue mass in the central renal sinus fat, splaying the pelvic vasculature.

Non-Contrast CT followed by IV contrast demonstrates a similar soft tissue mass with enhancement.  This is non-obstructing.  The remainder of the kidney is normal in appearance.  

On neither CT or U/S is the mass infiltrative in appearance.  There is no adenopathy.  A dissection flap is seen within the abdominal aorta...hmmm.
Renal infarct as a complication of a dissection flap in a patient with Marfan's Syndrome.
Renal Tumor
     - Renal Cell Carcinoma
     - If the patient was older, Transitional Cell Carcinoma
     - If this was a black male with sickle cell trait potentially Medullary carcinoma.

Renal Infection - Focal Pyelonephritis masquarading as a mass

Renal Infarct - focal (embolic)
Patient presenting with left flank pain and microhematuria.  

The rest of the history comes later...
This case underscores the value of old films.  The history provided when the patient re-presented for the renal abnormality had no mention of his Marfan diagnosis or recent surgery at another facility.  Given the microhematuria and mass appearance, Renal Cell Carcinoma would have been a diagnosis of exclusion.
