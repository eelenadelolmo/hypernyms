Active range of motion of the cervical spine revealed bilateral deficits with more pronounced deficits in rotation and lateral bending on the left side than compared to the right. She reported sharp pain in the neck during flexion and extension, and the neck pain radiated in the front of the chest during left lateral bending. She also reported neck pain during left and right rotation.

Reflexes of the biceps and triceps were graded 2/4. Cervical compression testing produced neck pain radiating straight down the back. Left rotation cervical compression testing produced pain that extended from the neck to the left shoulder. Right rotation cervical compression testing produced neck pain that extended to the right shoulder. Active range of motion of the shoulders revealed that she could elevate each shoulder 140° with pain in the neck, back and shoulder.

Muscle strength testing of the upper extremities revealed weakness of the wrist extensors and finger extensors on the left side. Grip strength, using a Jamar dynamometer, on the right side was noted as dominant. There was ipsilateral wrist and forearm pain when each side was tested while gripping the dynamometer. Neer’s testing when performed on either side could be accomplished to 150° without pain. The Hawkins-Kennedy and Supraspinatus tests were negative bilaterally.

Postural evaluation reveals the lumbar spine to be in anteflexion of 20°. Active range of motion of the lumbar spine revealed flexion to be performed to 18 degrees from 20°/60° with lower back and right lower extremity pain. Left lateral bending was accomplished was accomplished to 10°/25° with lower back pain. Right lateral bending was accomplished to 10°/25° with lower back pain. Extension was accomplished to 8°/25° with lower back pain. The subpatellar and Achilles reflexes were graded 2/4 bilaterally. The patient was unable to arise onto her toes in the static position. She was able to arise onto her heels in the static position. She was able to perform a 1/4 squat with lower back pain. The straight leg raise could be performed to 27° on the left with left hip pain. She was able to perform the right straight leg raise to 24° with lower back pain extending to the right knee. Internal and external rotation of the hips was limited. Deep palpation produced pain over the lateral and anterior hips bilaterally. Percussion and posterior to anterior compression of the spine produced pain through the entirety of the spine. Hypomobility was present over the cervicothoracic, thoracic and lumbosacral regions paraspinally. Pain/tenderness, asymmetry/misalignment, abnormal range of motion, and tissue/tone changes were associated with the areas of hypomobility. Deep palpation produced pain over the right buttock.

On the Durkan Gauge test, at a pressure of 14-15 psi, the patient experienced tingling into the thumb and into the 3rd-5th digits of the right hand. The results of this test indicate that the patient may have carpal tunnel’s syndrome that can occur as a result of median nerve compression.

These findings suggest possible double crush syndrome arising from the cervical spine and contributed to by the median nerve compression.
Nerve conduction studies determine whether there is proper electrical signal propagation down the median nerve and the muscles it innervates. If the signal is slowed or blocked in any way, then nerve conduction studies would detect this and would correlate to the clinical findings of altered sensation and muscle weakness that is associated with the syndrome. EMG detects whether there is proper muscle depolarization upon stimulation of the muscle. If there is any abnormality in this process, then it can be inferred that the nervous input to the particular muscle is not normal. This test is very important for detecting early nerve damage as it can detect minor loss of muscle function even before the patient experiences any type of muscle weakness. Abnormal results from these tests are suggestive of carpal tunnel’s syndrome, however, it must be kept in mind that if normal results are obtained, they may not rule out carpal tunnel symptoms, and so more investigation is warranted.  In this case, the patient had a negative EMG of the cervical and upper extremities.  As such, the EMG findngs did not corroborate either radiculopathy or Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.  However, Cervical compression testing does produce cervical and radiating pain to the right shoulder.  Durkan gauge testing was positive for a finding of CTS.  The clinical studies are useful in evaluating the patient and ultimately in this case are producing the correlative information for diagnosis.  Once the diagnosis is established, it would be most appropriate to be conservative initially. So the current initial options for treatment include: modifying lifestyle habits that put pressure on the median nerve and thereby reducing pain; wearing a splint/brace on the wrist to stabilize the wrist and prevent excessive movement about the wrist; and NSAIDs for symptomatic relief.
•	On a multiplanar, multisequence images of the cervical spine, at the C6-C7 level, there is a diffuse disc bulge and a broad-based posterior disc protrusion which has a right sided component. There is a tear of the annulus fibrosus. There is some deformity of the spinal cord and mild to moderate right foraminal narrowing. There is also a disc bulge present at the T1-T2 level with posterior disc protrusion. Spin echo pulse sequences were utilized to evaluate the lumbar spine, and images in the sagittal and axial planes were obtained. There was no remarkable signal within the vertebrae. On the sagittal images a small left paracentral disc herniation is seen at T10-11. On additional axial images, there is slight encroachment on the left foramen but is incompletely visualized since it is at the superior edge of the study. There is hypertrophy of the right facet, though the right foramen is patent. There is extensive multilevel spondylosis and paramedian bulge with varying degree of canal and foraminal encroachment. These findings correlate with the clinical diagnosis of vertebral subluxation complex.
•	Of the right and left wrist lateral x-ray views, there was evidence of deformity in both wrists. The right and left forearm AP and oblique x-ray images reveal a Madelung deformity with bowing of the radius. There is no apparent acute fracture or dislocation. Thus the impression of these reports is the presence of congenital Madelung Deformity of the right and left wrists.
Madelung Deformity, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, C6/C7 disc herniation, Possible double crush phenomena.
1.	Cervical Disc Disease: Disc herniation at C6-C7 usually is associated with injury to the C7 nerve root and can result in sensory, motor or reflex abnormalities in the affected nerve root distributions. This differential diagnosis is a strong possibility given the patient’s history, symptoms, presentation and imaging. Cervical radiculopathy can cause neck pain and numbness that may radiate to the digits. Specifically, the patient describes that she has pain and numbness in the dorsum of her left thumb. Cervical compression testing indicates radiation of pain which can contribute to the double crush phenomena.   Posttraumatic carpal tunnel’s syndrome due to her motor vehicle accident seems to be  likely.
2.	Compartment Syndrome: Trauma or fracture can impede venous outflow from an area and this can increase tissue pressure. In such a case, there is accumulation of waste products, and when combined with the lack of inflow of oxygenated blood, there is injury to the muscles and nerves within the surrounding area, and this can lead to pain, numbness and decreased sensations, secondary to nerve irritation. In light of the patient’s history of Madelung Deformity and recent motor vehicle accident, compartment syndrome of the forearm can be considered, because the accident may have affected an already malformed bony structure in the forearm. Although the symptomology of compartment syndrome can be similar to that of carpal tunnel’s syndrome (such as paresthesias, numbness or pain), the presence or absence of symptoms is not truly reliable. Moreover, the patient did not have redness, tenderness or swelling on physical exam, which are more common features in compartment syndrome. Most importantly, in compartment syndrome, there would be firmness on deep palpation of the area in question, and this is an important diagnostic finding that was absent in the patient. Also, on imaging, the patient had no fractures or dislocations which are typical etiologies for compartment syndrome. So, in light of the patient’s history and physical examination, compartment syndrome seems to be a less likely diagnosis.
41-year old right-hand-dominant female presents with bilateral hand pain, numbness, and tingling for the past 1 month after a motor vehicle accident. She had put her hands out and her wrists were bent into a dorsiflex position during the accident when her hands struck the dashboard resulting in traumatic extension to the wrists.  She does have Madelung’s Deformity bilaterally.

•	Madelung Deformity vs. Fibrous Dysplasia: In fibrous dysplasia, fibrous tissue (scar tissue) replaces normal bone, and this can weaken the bone and cause fractures/deformity. Fibrous dysplasia generally involves a single bone either in the skull or long bones in the arms or legs, and it occurs in adolescents and young adults. If the condition is mild, then fibrous dysplasia has no to few symptoms, and with increased severity can cause deformities and fractures of affected bones. Fibrous dysplasia can also cause nerve entrapment syndromes due to thickened fibrous tissue impinging on surrounding nerves. Though a rare cause, fibrous dysplasias can be associated with abnormal endocrine functioning of hormone-producing glands, such as the thyroid, whereas Madelung’s Deformity does not. In the symptomatic stages in severe fibrous dysplasia, it can cause fractures or bone deformities due to weakened bone and the increased likelihood of bending the bone and fracturing. Also, arthritis can become a complication in cases of severe deformity.
•	Madelung Deformity & Carpal Tunnel&#39;s Syndrome: Carpal tunnel’s syndrome is characterized as a condition of nerve compression at the wrist, usually of the median nerve, that can produce numbness, tingling, and/or weakness at and distal to the wrist. Since the median nerve is most commonly involved, symptomology of numbness and tingling often starts at the thumb, index and middle fingers. These symptoms can also awaken a patient at night, and patients will tend to “shake out” their hands, which provides temporary relief. The patient fits into this description as she exhibits these features. In considering the patient’s history, there is a possibility that the patient’s deformity may have contributed to her carpal tunnel’s syndrome after the accident by way of irritating the median nerve. Since the patient already has a bony deformity in both wrists, and in light of the history that the patient’s wrists were dorsiflexed during the accident, it is possible that the patient experienced irritation of the median nerve secondary to the force applied on wrists that have bony deformities. Another hypothesis to consider for the relation between Madelung Deformity and carpal tunnel syndrome is via tethering by Vickers ligament, which is a fibrous band that traverses from the distal radius to the lunate on the volar surface of the wrist. As part of the pathophysiology of Madelung Deformity, the Vickers ligament can thicken and tether, as a result of radial inclination. This increases the angle and the carpal bones begin to bulge into the radioulnar joint, resulting in separation of the articulating joint and thus increasing tension on Vickers ligament. Vickers ligament would be crossing over the transverse carpal ligament, under which the median nerve is found. If there is tethering of Vickers ligament, then this could possibly compress the portion of the underlying transverse carpal ligament and thus the median nerve. As a consequence, the median nerve would be irritated and lead to carpal tunnel syndrome like symptoms. However, the patient also has numbness on the dorsal aspect of the thumb, which is innervated by the superficial branch of the radial nerve. This suggests that there may be an additional pathology in this patient in along with carpal tunnel’s syndrome.
•	Double Crush Syndrome & Carpal Tunnel&#39;s Syndrome: Double crush syndrome involves carpal tunnel syndrome that’s associated with cervical radiculopathy. In double crush syndrome, a cervical radiculopathy can contribute in an additive manner to carpal tunnel syndrome because of increased risk of nerve entrapment along the same neuraxis. In the presence of cervical radiculopathy, there’s a higher likelihood of having carpal tunnel syndrome bilaterally. Double crush syndrome should be considered when the patient is an older female presenting with paresthesias and/or grip strength weakness that can be related to distal prolonged sensory latencies on nerve conduction studies. In the patient seen, she had pain along the left shoulder upon performing the cervical compression test. On radiographic findings, the patient also had disc herniations along the C6-C7 level. This area of distribution can give rise to the symptoms that the patient experiences, especially the numbness on the dorsal surface of the left thumb, since the C6 nerve root innervates the thumb area via contributions through the superficial branches of the radial nerve. Also, if the patient’s motor vehicle accident history is taken into consideration, then there could have been the possibility that the patient may have impinged on cervical nerve roots from random movements of the neck during the accident, especially when taking into account the fact that the patient has disc herniations along the C6-C7 level. Although there was no documentation of such a history, this is an important point to take into consideration.

Thus, considering the clinical history, it seems that double crush syndrome may also have played an important role in causing symptomology in the patient in addition to having Madelung Deformity and trauma. All of these factors may have impacted the patient in ways that significantly predisposed her bilateral carpal tunnel symptomatology.
