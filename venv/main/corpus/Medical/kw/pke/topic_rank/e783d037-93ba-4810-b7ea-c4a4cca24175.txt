Echogenic gallbladder wall with posterior linear echo (gallstones) and posterior shadowing.
Gallstones
Gallstone filled gallbladder demonstrating a WES sign
41 yo female with right upper quadrant pain and nausea.
This is a classic ultrasound appearance for the Wall Echo Shadow sign which is indicative of a gallstone filled gallbladder. You can visualize the gallbladder wall as an echogenic line with a posterior linear echogenic line that is gallstones against the wall and then a posterior clean shadow. You must differentiate gallstones from air or calcification in the wall. However, with air or calcification, you will only see echo and shadow. The gallbladder wall will not be visualized.
