Increase from last documented Creat of 1.5 to ED value of 6.5
Bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes

Urology consultation with treatment per their recommendations with plan for resection of bladder tumor and placement of double J stents.
OLD CT for comparison: mild hydrouretonephrosis

New CT with marked increase in hydrouretonephrosis with distal obstruction, no renal or ureter calculi identified, foley in decompressed bladder.

Spot AP flouro images demonstrate percutaneous nephrosomy placement with tubes in renal pelvis. Dilated ureters without proximal obstuction.
Percutaneous Nephrostomy for hydrouretonephrosis secondary to malignant distal obstruction
Distal obstruction due to prostate cancer
Distal obstruction due to bladder cancer
Male with prostate & bladder cancer
Prior CT with mild hydrouretonephrosis

Presents with fall, general weakness, tremor, and “feeling poorly”
Percutaneous nephrostomy is commonly indicated for one of four reasons: 
1. Relief of urinary obstruction
	Preservation of renal function, treatment of 	infection
2. Urinary diversion 
	usually for urinary tract injury but may also 	be done for fistula or hemorrhagic cystitis
3. Access for therapeutic interventions 
	Antegrade pyelogram or Whitaker test
4. Access for diagnostic interventions
	Stone therapy, benign strictures, ureteral 	stent placement or removal of foreign bodies

Percutaneous Nephrostomy

Preprocedure: screening coags, Antibiotics if not already on board include coverage for common urinary pathogens with infection; however, in this case Ancef 1gram would be adequate.

Procedure: Using ultrasound guidance in a posterior lateral approach a posterior calyx was selected.  Urine noted to flow freely from the needle and a 0.018 guide wire was placed into the renal pelvis. Using a 8 french access set under floroscopic guidance a short stiff 0.038 wire was placed. The tract was subsequently dilated to 8 french and 8 french locking pigtail catheter was placed. 

Complications: possible complications include: bleeding, infection if not already present, damage to kidney, liver, spleen, bowel, pneumothorax, empyema, and urinomas.
