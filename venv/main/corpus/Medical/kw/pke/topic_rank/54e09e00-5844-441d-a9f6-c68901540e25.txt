14 year old girl with HO of pseudotumor cerebri.  She has had multiple lumbar punctures for diagnosis and therapy.

Developed intractable headache precipitated by standing, one week prior to this study.
There is dramatic enhancement and engorgement of the cervical spinal epidural veins.  This may have prevented downward displacement of the posterior fossa structures through the foramen magnum.
