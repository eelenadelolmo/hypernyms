The patient was initially diagnosed with chemical conjunctivitis with corneal sloughing. In addition to irrigation, he was started on Gentamycin ophthalmic ointment. Medivac of the patient was initially delayed by IED attacks in the surrounding area. He was re-evaluated at 0700 the next morning with complaints at that time of decreased vision, pain, and pressure at which time the patient’s eye was re-irrigated and transported to the battalion aid station.  

Documentation is limited from the battalion aid station though the patient was maintained on Gentamycin and Refresh eye drops until evacuation to the Army combat support hospital. He was eventually evacuated from combat theater due to a persistent corneal epithelial defect and concern for limbal ischemia.

The patient was followed for one year by ophthalmology and treated with Pred Forte, Restasis, and Genteal during that time. His final eye exam showed residual superior and inferior limbal stem cell changes with a return to his baseline visual acuity at which time he was lost to follow up.

?21 yo, right eye dominant?, male, Marine waked from sleep by his friends throwing Texas Pete Hot Sauce and Gold Bond mentholated powder in his face as part of a practical joke. He immediately experienced pain in his right eye and spent roughly 30 minutes irrigating his eye before he presented to medical attention. Initial treatment involved continued irrigation with 1.5 liters of saline during which time his corneal epithelium sloughed off.
Despite the patient's longterm sequela from the chemical burn to his eye the damage to the corneal epithelium generally heals well following good irrigation soon after the injury. It is unlikely that his limbal stem cell changes could have been prevented by earlier follow up by ophthalmology. Treatment recommendations for patients with chemical eye burns who present in the emergency or primary care setting are listed below:

Initial emergency treatment of chemical burns to the eye:
- Copious but gentle irrigation using normal saline or lactated ringers.Tap water may be used if saline or ringers is unavailable  
- Irrigation should be continued until a pH between 7.0 – 7.4 is obtained.  
- Removal of caustic materials retained in the conjunctival fornices may be accomplished by eversion of the eyelids and manipulation with a moistened cotton-tipped applicator.
- Surgical removal is required for acidic or basic foreign bodies embedded in the eye. 

Work up and disposition:
- Take a thorough history of injury, taking care to document the specific chemical, duration, and amount of irrigation.  
- Physical exam should include; visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and slit lamp exam with fluorescein staining.
-If an epithelial defect is present a  topical cycloplegic agent should be prescribed three times daily for pain reduction. 
 Phenylephrine should be avoided as it can result in further limbal ischemia.  
-Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment four times daily to affected eyes.
-Consider administering tetanus toxoid.  
-Consider topical corticosteroids after consultation with an ophthalmologist.
-Frequent use of preservative-free artificial tears.
-Oral pain medication PRN 

Follow up:
-Ophthalmology consultation is recommended for all but minor burns: Patients with corneal clouding or an epithelial defect after irrigation should receive prompt ophthalmology referral.
-Treatment for patients with chemosis and no corneal or anterior chamber findings after irrigation is erythromycin ointment four times daily and ophthalmologic referral within 24-48 hours.
