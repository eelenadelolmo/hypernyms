Usually the cysts (but not the osteoarthritis itself) will improve on their own with time. In the meantime, if they are symptomatic, using an NSAID or avoiding exacerbating activities may help. Usually leaving the cysts alone is the best treatment. Surgical excision place unneeded risk of complications such as infection or poor wound healing.

Subchondral cysts are fluid-filled sacs extruding from the joint. They consist of thickened joint material, primarily hyaluronic acid, a substance found in the fluid that normally lubricates the joint. The cysts most commonly occur over the end or middle finger joints and represent the early phases of osteoarthritis of those joints.
