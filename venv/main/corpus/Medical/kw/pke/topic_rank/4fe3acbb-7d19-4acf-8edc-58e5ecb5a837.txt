No lab work available.
No treatment.
Biopsy: There is a mild perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with increased density of collagen bundles in the reticular dermis.  Capillaries are reduced in number with atrophy of eccrine glands.
Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy/Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis
54 yo woman with idiopathic end-stage renal disease for four years requiring renal dialysis.  She presents now with extensive dry and firm areas that started on both anterior shins and rapidly progressed to involve both inner thighs, over the past 3 months.  She also complains of some tenderness of the lesions to palpation.  

PMH: Six previous gadolinium MR scans.     

Unremarkable family history.
Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy (NFD) is a rare, acquired, idiopathic disorder in patients with end-stage renal disease.  Clinically, patient typically presents with large area of indurated, thick, sclerotic skin involving the extremities.  Muscle weakness and flexion contractures are also common.  Histologic evaluation reveals increased dermal fibroblasts and elastic fibers, with thick collagen bundles and mucin deposition.  

The pathophysiology of NFD is not known.  Most patients have a history of end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis.  Most recently, there have been reports of NFD associated with previous gadolinium MRA scans.  Also, there are reported cases following peritoneal dialysis, renal transplantation, and acute and chronic renal disease.
