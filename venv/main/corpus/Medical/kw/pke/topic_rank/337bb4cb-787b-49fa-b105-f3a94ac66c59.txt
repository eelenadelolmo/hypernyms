Beware of normal variants - far more common in venous anatomy compared to arteries. In some patients, the superior sagittal sinus (SST) drains primarily to one side or the othe, usually into the right transverse and sigmoid sinus.  In some cases, the deep venous system (internal cerebral veins - ICV, vein of Galen, straight sinus) may drain preferentially into the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses. The right internal jugular vein is dominant in about 2/3 of patients. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11280654 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25468583
