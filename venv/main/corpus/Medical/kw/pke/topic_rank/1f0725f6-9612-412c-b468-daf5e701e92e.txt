No treatment needed unless continued growth causes impingment of adjacent nerve or vascular structure or causes delterious mass effect on adjacent soft tissues.  

Lesions should be followed over time and should stop growing after growth plate fusion.  Rarely, malignant degeneration to chondrosarcoma may occur and assessment of cartilagenous cap thickness can be performed using MRI.
