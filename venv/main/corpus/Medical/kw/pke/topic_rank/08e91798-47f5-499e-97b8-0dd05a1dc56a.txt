Surgical correction (pyeloplasty) is indicated to relieve the obstruction and preserve renal function on the affected side.  Follow up US imaging is typically performed one-two months after surgery to confirm relief of UPJ obstruction, though some degree of renal pelvis dilation usually persists.
Ultrasound images demonstrate grade III hydronephrosis of the left kidney.  The right kidney, both ureters and the bladder are normal sonographically.

Lasix renal scan using 99mTC MAG3 demonstrates left hydronephrosis with delayed uptake and excretion.  There is minimal clearance before and after administration of lasix.  The differential function is 45% on the left and 55% on the right.
