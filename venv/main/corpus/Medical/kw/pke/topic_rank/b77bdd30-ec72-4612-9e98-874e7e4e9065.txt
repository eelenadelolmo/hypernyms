Physical exam shows thyroid enlargement with prominent left sided nodules as well as bilateral mastectomy.
CXR: hypoinflation of lungs, increased pulmonary vascular markings throughout bilateral lung fields, multiple pulmonary nodules with the most prominent in the right lower lobe, mild cardiomegaly, lack of breast shadows bilaterally, fluid withing the right major and minor fissure. 

CT of Chest/ABD/Pelvis: Diffuse thyroid enlargement with nodule present in the left lobe, multiple large (>5mm) pulmonary nodules throughout both lungs, bilateral myelolipomas with L larger than R.

48y/o female with history of bilateral breast cancer s/p bilateral mastectomy who is currently hospitalized after obtaining bronchoscopy to evaluate multiple pulmonary nodules.
Patient had bilateral mastectomy prior to age of 50 indicating a likely genetic disorder contributing to early onset breast cancer vs. prophylactic mastectomy's.  The patient's thyroid abnormalities make Cowden's syndrome the most likely genetic abnormality.  The multiple pulmonary nodules as well as myelolipomas are also consistent with this diagnosis
