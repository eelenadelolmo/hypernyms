BP 160/82 otherwise VSS.
PHYSICAL EXAM: Noncontributory.
Endograft.
1) HiRes CHEST CT, axial images (1) lung window and (1) soft tissue window which demonstrate a focal outpouching along the posterior aspect of the proximal descending thoracic aorta at the level of the arch.
2) CXR, PA/LAT demonstrates a focal assymetric saccular bulge of the posterolateral aspect proximal descending aorta most likely a pseudoaneurysm.
AORTIC PSEUDOANEURYSM
1) Posttraumatic pseudoaneurysm.
2) Mycotic pseudoaneurysm.
3) Ulcerated atherosclerotic plaque.
73 year old male presents for a high resolution chest CT to evaluate for possible interstitial lung disease based on a recent chest radiograph. No trauma history.
This was an incidental finding in an asymptomatic patient with hypertension. Note, this is the wrong location on the arch for a ductus bump (typically anterior in the AP window).
