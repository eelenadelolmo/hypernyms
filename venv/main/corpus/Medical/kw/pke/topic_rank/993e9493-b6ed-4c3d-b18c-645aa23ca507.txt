Normal abdominal examination with negative Murphy's sign.
Since the gallbladder polyp identified is solitary and measures slightly larger than 5 mm (but less than 10 mm) it should be monitored with follow-up ultrasonography to ensure its stability.  According to some texts, gallbladder polyps that are 5 mm or smaller require no treatment or follow-up, those that are greater than 5 mm but less than 10 mm require monitoring and those that are 10 mm or larger should be removed even though most will prove to be benign with only a small percentage being malignant.
A small (approximately 5 mm), nonmobile, intraluminal polypoid mass adherent to the nondependent portion of the gallbadder wall demonstrating the typical "ball on the ball" sign of a cholesterol polyp.  No acoustic shadowing is observed.  The common bile duct is not dilated.

Forty two-year-old male with intermittent right upper quadrant abdominal pain for one year.
A solitary gallbladder polyp was identified on this study.  Cholesterol polyps are the most common type of gallbladder polyp, usually 5 mm or smaller and are usually multiple.  This polyp was slightly larger than 5 mm and was solitary, which requires consideration of other less common types of gallbladder polyps to be included in the differential diagnosis: adenoma, papilloma, leiomyoma, lipoma and neuroma.  Gallstones and sludge balls were ruled out due to the nonmobile nature of the lesions during patient repositioning.  The lack of a shadow also makes gallstones unlikely.   The common bile duct was not dilated.  No detectable blood flow was demonstrated on color Doppler imaging.
