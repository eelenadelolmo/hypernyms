Atherosclerosis
82 year old diabetic male with nonhealing ulcer on left foot.  Patient to undergo transmetatarsal amputation.  Requesting atherectomy of the left lower extremity to improve blood flow to foot to improve healing.
Although atherectomy is still making a come-back for lower extremity arteries, particularly the tibial arteries, it showed a dramatic result in this patient. He had marked improvement in blood flow to his left foot, underwent transmetatarsal amputation with a good result at discharge from the hospital. Although further clinical trials are needed to show evidence for atherectomy success, it proved to be beneficial in this patient.
