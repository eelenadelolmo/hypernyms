Texto: 
Swelling and pain which increases in intensity with movement.  ROM is decreased with flexion and extension.
• Type I: undisplaced or minimally displaced fx.
treated non-operatively (consider presumptive tx, reimage in 3 wks)
pt given a sling or splinted for a few days
begin early ROM, usually w/in several days or as early as pain allows to avoid post traumatic stiffness
excellent prognosis
• Type II:  partial displacement, depression, or angulation
by definition:  <30 % of articular involvement and > 2 mm of displacement
Treatment based on elbow exam after administration of local anesthetic
Distinguish between motion limited by fx fragments vs limited by pain
If no mechanical block, fx is treated similar to Type I
• Type III:  comminuted fractures of the entire head 	
Surgery:  excision of radial head, ORIF, radial head implants
Radial head fracture, anterior fat pad ("sail sign") and posterior fat pad sign.
Radial Head Fracture
• Elbow Sprain
• Radial head fx
• Olecranon Fx
• Olecranon bursitis
• Elbow dislocation
• Other joint effusion
21 y/o man presents w/right elbow pain after falling from a height of 6 feet, while playing basketball.  He is concerned for swelling and pain of the elbow, which increases in intensity with movement.
Radial head is most common type of elbow fracture in adults and primarily occurs in adults, whereas fractures of the radial neck are more common in children
fx of the radial head and neck generally results from a hard fall on an outstretched hand (FOOSH) impact of fall drives head of radius axially onto capitellum of distal humerus

Companion Pediatric Case: http://rad.usuhs.edu/medpix/kiosk_image.html?mode=pt&pt_id=13431#pic

typical manifestations: 
pain with flex/extension or supination/pronation of elbow 
+/- effusion in the elbow
tenderness on palpation directly over radial head, 
if fx is displaced, click or crepitus over radial head is detected w/ supination
if elbow ROM is limited, then aspirate and inject several cc of lidocaine, and then re-examine:
check for blocks to flexion-extension as well as supination-pronation 
wrist tenderness with ROM is common
