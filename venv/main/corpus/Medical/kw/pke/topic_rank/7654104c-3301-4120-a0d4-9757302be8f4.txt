Evaluation of plasma amino acids revealed elevation of branched chain amino acids, including alloisoleucine.
Treatment of the acute metabolic decompensation, and dietary restriction of branched chain amino acids.
•Axial T2 weighted images reveal T2 prolongation, consistent with edema, in the deep cerebellar white matter, dorsal brainstem, cerebral peduncles, and posterior limb of the internal capsule.
•MR spectroscopy reveals a broad peak at 0.9 ppm representing branched chain amino acids and branched chain alpha ketoacids.  An abnormal peak is also present at 1.33 ppm consistent with lactate.
Maple syrup urine disease
• Maple syrup urine disease
• Other aminoacidopathies presenting in the first week of life
