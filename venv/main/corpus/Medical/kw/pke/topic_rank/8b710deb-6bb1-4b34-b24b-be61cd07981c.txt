Selected coronal and sagittal views of a pediatric head ultrasound show multiple anechoic foci adjacent to the frontal horn of the right lateral ventricle with enhanced through transmission and thin walls.
Periventricular Leukomalacia
Periventricular Leukomalacia
Twin B, born at 31 weeks 2 days, began having hypoxic events at day of life 7, showing desaturations to the mid 80's.
Periventricular leukomalacia occurs mainly in premature infants (<34weeks)and is secondary to hypoxic injury.  In the premature infant, the watershed area is located perventricularly between immature cerbral arteries and the basal ganglia aterial supply until after 34 weeks of gestation when the cerebral arteries mature and move the watershed areas to the cortex in between cerebral artery distribution as in an adult.  This area is highly susecptible to ischemic changes.  Infarction with reperfusion hemorrhage leads to necrosis, cyst formation and eventually gliosis.  The cyst formation, as seen in this infant, typically occurs 2-3 weeks post hemorrhage and can take several months to resolve, leaving a glial scar as mentioned above.  Multiple cysts can coalesce to form persistant large porencephalic cysts.
Sequelae includes spastic diplegia or quadriplegia, developmental delay, visual defects, and mild to severe mental retardation.
