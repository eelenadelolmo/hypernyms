Film #2 and 3: Axial T1 and T2 weighted images, respectively, shows a bilobed T1 hypointense and T2 heterogenously hyperintense mass arising from the left optic nerve sheath with mildly associated proptosis. There is a clear demarcation present between the mass and optic nerve.   

Film #4: Axial T1 postgadolinium with fat saturation shows the mass to enhance intensely and is only slightly inhomogeneous.
