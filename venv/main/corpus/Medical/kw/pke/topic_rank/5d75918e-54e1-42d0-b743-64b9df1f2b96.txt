Physical Exam and Laboratory: 
No pertinent findings
Treatment and Follow-up: 
-Diuresis for pleural effusions initially which decreased the patient’s symptom of dyspnea on exertion
-Placement of ureteral stents due to compression of Left ureter causing Hydronephrosis
-Chemotherapy started at diagnosis and continued for greater than one year
-Patient succumbed to her disease approximately 15 months following her diagnosis
Image Findings: 
CXR (AP Portable): mediastinal mass, left pleural effusion
Chest CT: large mediastinal mass spanning the anterior, middle, and posterior mediastinum and descending into abdomen and     
                   encircling the aorta, large left and right pleural effusions
Abdomen and Pelvis CT: large mass descending from mediastinum into the retroperitoneal space and into the pelvis compressing 
                                            the Inferior Vena Cava, Hydronephrosis of the Left kidney
Diffuse Rhabdomyosarcoma
Differential Diagnosis for these findings in this case:
Based on CXR: Malignancy, Granulomatous disease, Other inflammation (abscess/pneumonia), Benign neoplasm, and Congenital 
                           anomaly
Based on CT: Lymphoma, Other malignancy (most likely soft tissue in origin), Metastatic disease
History (can include gestational age, or age in days, weeks, months):
Previously healthy 13 y/o female with shortness of breath on exertion.
Discussion (include references): 
Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood and adolescence, usually arising before age 20.  It is classified into three histological subtypes: Embryonal, the most common subtype often with the best prognosis; Alveolar, the most common subtype in adolescents and this patient’s final diagnosis; and Pleomorphic, the least common of the three subtypes.  Overall, in children, 65% of patients diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma are cured with treatment consisting of chemotherapy, surgery, and occasionally radiation.
