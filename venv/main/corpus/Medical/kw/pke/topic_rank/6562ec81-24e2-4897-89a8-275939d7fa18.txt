Normal abdominal examination with negative Murphy's sign.
None required since the size of the polyps is 5 mm or less (polypoid lesions that are between 5 and 10 mm require monitoring to ensure stability).
Multiple small (approximately 5 mm), nonmobile, intraluminal polypoid masses adherent to the dependent and nondependent portions of the gallbadder wall.  No acoustic shadowing is observed.  No detectable blood flow is demonstrated on color Doppler imaging.
Gallbladder (Cholesterol) Polyp
Cholesterol Polyp
Adenoma
Papilloma
Leiomyoma
Lipoma
Neuroma
Cholelithiasis
Sludge Balls
Metastasis (especially melanoma)
Forty two-year-old female with intermittent right upper quadrant abdominal pain for three months.
Gallstones and sludge balls were ruled out due to the nonmobile nature of the lesions during patient repositioning.  The lack of a shadow also makes gallstones unlikely.  The common bile duct was not dilated.
