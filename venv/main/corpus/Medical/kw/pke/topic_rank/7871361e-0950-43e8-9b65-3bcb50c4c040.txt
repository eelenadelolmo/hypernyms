Unremarkable
None, asymptomatic incidental finding.
Barium swallow study under fluoroscopy shows a soft tissue density compressing the posterior wall of the esophagus in the mediastinum. 
CT shows aberrant right subclavian artery arising from the descending aorta and passing left to right posterior to the esophagus and trachea.
Left aortic arch with aberrant right subclavian artery
N/A
65yo male complaining of regurgitation of food. Barium swallow showed esophageal diverticulum.
Although incomplete vascular rings such as an aberrant right subclavian can cause dysphagia, in this patient the esophageal diverticulum was more likely to be responsible for the regurgitation of food.
