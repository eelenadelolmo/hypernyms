B/l lower lung rales.
Chest radiographs and CT demonstrate interstitial thickening at the right base consistent with fibrosis as well as pleural plaques and calcifications.  There is also hyperinflation of the lungs and flattening of the hemidiaphragms.
Asbestosis
Interstitial Processes
-Pneumoconioses
-Chemical inhalation
-Chronic aspiration
-Connective tissue disease related fibrosis
-Drug-induced fibrosis
-Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
-Desquamative interstitial pneumonitis
Pleural calcifications
-Tuberculosis
-Healed Empyema
-Hemothorax
-Pneumoconioses
83 year-old male with dyspnea.
This case represents a classic case of asbestosis given the findings of fibrosis with pleural calcifications in a patient with known exposure.  Malignant mesothelioma is less likely because it is usually unilateral.  This patient also has hyperinflation and flattening of the diaphragms consistent with obstructive airway disease secondary to smoking.
