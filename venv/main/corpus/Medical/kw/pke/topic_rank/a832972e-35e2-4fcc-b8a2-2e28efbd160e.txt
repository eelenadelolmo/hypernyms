A Left salpingectomy was performed and submitted to pathology which confirmed the diagnosis of tubal ectopic pregnancy with associated hemorrhage.  The patient is doing well post-operatively.
A dilated 1cm tubular structure, predominantly hyperechoic, with some central hypoechoic foci is seen anterior to an unremarkable appearing L ovary.  A gestational sac is not seen in or around the tubular structure or in the left adnexa.
No gestational sac is seen on the single image of the uterus.
A moderate amount of free fluid is noted in the pelvis with increased echotexture/debris within the dependent regions of the fluid collection
