Texto: 
Swollen posterior ankle with palpable soft tissue defect in the region of the Achilles tendon.
Surgery is pending.
Sonography: Absence of detectable tendon, tendon retraction, and herniation of fat into the expected region of the tendon. 

MRI:  Low-signal-intensity disruption of the Achilles tendon on axial and sagittal T1-weighted MRimage and enlarged Achilles tendon with disrupted high-signal-intensity on the axial T2-weighted MR image consistent with a tear.
Achilles tendon rupture
Full thickness tear, partial thickness tear
70 yo male felt a pop and intense pain in his calf while descending stairs, after which he had difficulty weightbearing and plantarflexing.
This case, in presentation, clinical exam, and radiographic findings, is typical for an Achilles tendon rupture.
