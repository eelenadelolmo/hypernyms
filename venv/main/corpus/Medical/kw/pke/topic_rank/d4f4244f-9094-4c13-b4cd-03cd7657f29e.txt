Texto: 
Equal movement of extremities, nystagmus and searching eye movements.  Very small lump palpable at occipital area of head below posterior fontanel.  Anterior and posterior fontanels are open, soft, and flat.
Treatment:  Surgical reduction of encephalocele, reconstruction of brain and follow up medications for seizure disorder.  Hydrocephalus was treated with VP shunt.

Follow-up:  Follow with neurosurgery for revisions of VP shunt if necessary.  After surgery, continue following with developmental clinic as well as neurology for functionality.
Findings are consistent with holoprosencephaly with communication between the right and left lateral ventricle, and fusion of the thalami.  The pituitary and optic chiasm appear to be normal.  There is a small parietoccipital encephalocele.  This appears to contain CSF without any evidence of brain tissue at this time.  There also is some evidence of abnormal clefting in the frontal lobes bilaterally.
Encephalocele
•Encephalocele
•Arachnoid cyst
•Intracranial bleed
•Infection/abscess
•Occipital cystic hygroma
•Occipital dural venous anomaly 
•Dural sinus anuerysm
After a pregnancy which was complicated by HTN and polyhydramnios the patient was delivered at 34 weeks gestation by vaginal delivery.  Birth weight was below the third percentile and diagnosis of duodenal atresia and hydrocephalus were made in neonatal period.  Imaging work up to determine extent of malformations and to evaluate small lump at the occipital area just below the posterior fontanel of head on day 1 of life.
In 2011 the patient was presenting with stable exams.  Hydrocephalus had resolved with continued use of VP shunt.  The patient was diagnosed to have Warburg-walker syndrome and muscle-eye-brain disease.  Patient follows up with opthomology and neurosurgery for continued management.
