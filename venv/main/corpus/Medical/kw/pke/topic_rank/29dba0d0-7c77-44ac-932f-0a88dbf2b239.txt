Vitals: T 37.3?C, P 139, BP 114/73, RR 39, PulseOx 95% on RA, BMI 29.4
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. S3 gallop present. Tachycardia with distant heart sounds, no friction rub or murmur. Pedal and radial pulses palpable.  No JVD present.
Lungs: Normal work of breathing, no respiratory distress.  No wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Decreased breath sounds in bilateral lower lobes.  No chest wall tenderness on palpation.

ECG showed sinus tachycardia (140 bpm), mild right ventricular conduction delay, depressed PR intervals in the limb leads, and diffuse T wave flattening

Echocardiogram showed large pericardial effusion, early signs of cardiac tamponade, and normal left ventricle size and systolic function.

On original hospitalization patient was treated with Ibuprofen 600mg q6h.  Ibuprofen therapy was continued for 6 days (3 inpatient and 3 outpatient) and was converted to aspirin therapy 1,000mg Q6H due to failure of response to ibuprofen.  Upon readmission, the patient had diagnostic and therapeutic pericardiocentesis removed 755cc of serosanguinous fluid which resolved the tachycardia.  Fluid did not re-accumulate post-procedure.    Patient was transferred to an outside facility for heart catheterization for definitive diagnosis.  Patient was followed with serial echocardiograms for three months post-hospitalization none of which showed re-accumulation of fluid and no progression to chronic constrictive pericarditis
1.AP Chest X-Ray
Moderate to marked cardiomegaly.  Areas of sub-segmental atelectasis bilaterally, and small bilateral pleural effusions. There is suggestion of a small amount of pneumomediastinum along the left heart border and left cardiophrenic angle, although this could be artifactual due to superimposition linear lung markings. No skeletal abnormality is identified.

2.Chest CT w/ contrast
Findings: There is a large pericardial effusion with bilateral pleural  effusions, greater on the right than on the left. There are areas of atelectasis in both lower lobes and the lingula. There is no evidence of free air in the chest. The heart size is normal. There is a left-sided aortic arch. Pulmonary vascularity appears normal and symmetric. I see no evidence of hilar adenopathy. Skeletal structures have a normal appearance. There are mediastinal nodes seen, particularly in the left superior mediastinum, the largest of which is approximately 2.6 cm in length.

16 year old overweight male presented to outside ED in February 2011 and was transferred to here with 1 day history of “achy, pressure” type chest pain.  Pain was described as sub-sternal, non-radiating, and not associated with breathing, eating, or movements.  Patient denied prior episodes, palpitations, SOB, recent illness, or chest trauma.  He was started on Ibuprofen 600mg q6h and discharged on third day.  Patient was seen at outpatient cardiology three days post-discharge and was switched to high dose ASA therapy.  Patient presented to the ED six days post-discharge with worsened chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, pale, tachycardia, and lethargy.  Patient was admitted to the PICU.
