Right sided colonic diverticulosis involving the ascending and proximal transverse colon.
Diverticulosis
Diverticulosis.  Carful attention to exclude coincident polyp.
54 y.o. Asian female presents for screening barium enema after a failed colonoscopy due to a redundant sigmoid.  No significant past medical history, no surgical history.
This study shows the relatively less common isolated right sided diverticulosis.  This is classically described as more common in people of Asian decent, as in this case.  This type is more easily confused with appendicitis or acute cholecystitis when inflamed.
