Point tenderness over the anterior tibia, no instability
In general, no follow-up required for NOF.  Large lesions prone to pathologic fracture, or those that develop secondary aneurysmal bone cysts, may require curettage and bone grafting.
Lytic lesion of the proximal tibial metaphysis, with a narrow zone of transition and mild cortical expansion.  Sclerotic margin, no overlying periosteal reaction.  There is a pathologic fracture through the lesion.
Nonossifying Fibroma
• "Don't touch" lesion consistent with Nonossifying fibroma/fibroxanthoma
• Chondromyxoid fibroma can have a similar radiographic appearance, but is an uncommon lesion
• Fibrous dysplasia tends to be more central than eccentric
Kicked in the shin playing soccer, now with persistent knee pain.
Classic appearance, location and presentation (incidental to minor trauma).
