Late corticomedullary phase of enhancement demonstrates thin crescents of contrast in the collecting tubules surrounding dilated left calyces
Crescent Sign (of recoverable renal function)
Newly discovered left adnexal mass
In this patient, the mid and distal left ureter appeared normal on this scan, and there was no obvious etiology for the proximal obstruction.  Thus it is not clear that the pelvic mass was the definitive cause of the dilated collecting system and crescent sign.  Positional obstruction, intermittent and incomplete but not present on this study, could explain these findings.
