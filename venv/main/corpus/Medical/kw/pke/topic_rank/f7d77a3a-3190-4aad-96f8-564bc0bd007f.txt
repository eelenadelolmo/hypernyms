A small amount of contrast was injected into the stomach via an enteric tube.  Contrast passed through the stomach into the proximal duodenum, but after greater than fifteen minutes of intermittent observation, would not pass beyond the proximal duodenum.  Contrast demonstrates somewhat of a beak-like point at its distal-most position within the duodenum, and gas is visualized within bowel distal to the point of obstruction, concerning for the possibility of volvulus.
