Caudal Regression Syndrome
• Sirenomelia 
• Neural tube defect 
• Segmental spinal agenesis 
• VACTERL
This 15 y.o. girl presented with a history of chronic back pain with no relief. She tried some NSAIDs which did not seem to help with the pain. She was later prescribed Vicodin and Lidocaine patches which seemed to mitigate the pain.
This 15 year old patient had some noteworthy complications. Firstly, she had a neurogenic bladder that was repaired with a vesicostomy. Secondly, she had a meningomyelocele that was also repaired. These are two possible complications that must be accounted for in caudal regression syndrome.
