1. axial ct images that were obtained in the normal abdominal protocol.  The images are in arterial phase as seen by the contrast filled aorta.  The liver is abnormally heterogenous in attenuation.  The next image shows the abnormal increase attenuation of the hepatic veins.  The next image shows enlarge portal vein and as the vein reaches the periphery, there is pooling of the contrast.  The last image shows a large common hepatic artery.  These findings are consistent with arterial venous shunting which may be caused by Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia or a diffuse neoplastic process.  The patient has a history of  Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia and cutaneous lesions.
Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) and Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM)
1. arterial venous malformation
2. diffuse hepatic cellular carcinoma or diffuse metastatic disease
Rule out diverticular disease in patient with abdominal pain
