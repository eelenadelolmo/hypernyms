Surgery is recommended only for treatment of symptomatic lesions and only when significant hemodynamic benefit is expected.  This woman has lived for six decades without significant cardiac symptoms.
CT Scout radiograph demonstrated mild enlargement of the cardiac silouhette with mild increase in pulmonary vascularity.  There are calcification in the aorta.

The CT images reveal cardiac enlargement.  The positions of the aorta and main pulmonary artery are transposed, with the aorta lying anterior and to the left of the main pulmonary artery.  

The positions of the ventricles are also reversed, with the anatomic left ventricle lying directly behind the sternum and the trabeculated right ventricle posterior, forming the left heart border. 

These findings are consistent with a congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries.
Congenitally Corrected Transposition of the Great Vessels
• Congenitally corrected Transposition of Great Arteries
• Ventricular noncompaction
• Some other congenital heart disease
A 63 year old lady is being evaluated for cirrhosis.
