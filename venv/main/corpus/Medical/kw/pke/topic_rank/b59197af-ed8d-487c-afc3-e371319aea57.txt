Shortness of breath
Increasing dyspnea on exertion
Restricted pattern on pulmonary function testing
After confirmation of pericardial effusion by diagnostic radiology (TTE - Transthoracic Echocardiography) and absence of ischemia or infarct by dual isotope nuclear cardiology, the patient proceeded to surgery for a pericardial window.  Following the procedure, symptoms resolved rapidly and post-op CXR 9 months later shows a return of cardiomediastinal silhouette to pre-operative study size.
CXR:
Pre-op - Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette size
Post-op - Enlarged cardiomediastinal sihouette size, which given rapid change is most consistent with pericardial effusion
Post-2nd op - Cardiomediastinal sihouette size has returned to normal

Dual Isotope Stress Test:
Circumferential and uniform wide photopenic volume enveloping the heart is consistent with pericardial effusion.  Normal LVEF of >65%.  Normal perfusion without evidence of ischemia or infarct.

Echo:
Technically difficult exam with suboptimal views (left parasternal long axis view is shown).  Large pericardial effusion measuring 2 cm in greatest diameter.  Overall normal left ventricular function to include 60-65% LVEF. Impaired diastolic relaxation and RV/RA collapse noted. No significant valvular abnormalities present. Paradoxical septal motion consistent with post-op status from median sternotomy.
Pericardial Effusion - Dual Isotope Appearance
• Pericardial effusion
• Cardiomegaly
• Pericardial effusion with features of early tamponade
55 y.o. woman presents with increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion four weeks after 2-vessel CABG.
Large pericardial effusions are treated with pericardiocentesis or surgical placement of a pericardial window; and, collection of dual-isotope images is unusual.  Fortunately, sufficient counts were obtained to demonstrate a normal exam.
