Patient with right CV angle tenderness and history of multiple UTI's was noted to have scalloping of vertebral bodies on a stone-protocol CT of the abdomen.  These were incompletely visualized and an MR was subsequently ordered.
The lesion, although causing some displacement of the thecal sac and scalloping of the vertebral bodies, has no aggressive features.  It also, follows CSF signal and was found incidentally.
