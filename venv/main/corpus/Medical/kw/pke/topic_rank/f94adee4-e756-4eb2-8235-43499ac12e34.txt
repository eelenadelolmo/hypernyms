Axial CT images of upper thorax demonstrate the aberrant origin of the right subclavian from the medial wall of the aorta as the last branch of the arch.  The right subclavian courses posterior to the esophagus.  Additionally the left vertebral artery arises directly from the arch, thus making a "5 vessel arch."
