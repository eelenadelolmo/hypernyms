The patient is currently on pharmacological therapy for Multiple Sclerosis. She has had a chronic, intermittant course, so far, and seems to be slightly progressing in symptomatology. She currently has no symptoms of optic neuritis.
Axial FLAIR MRI sequences demonstrate multiple small foci of increased signal intensity in the periventricular white matter which had increased in number compared to prior MRI performed four years prior. The left optic nerve was enlarged on the axial T2WI from 2001 consistent with the patients symptoms of left optic neuritis. The left optic nerve has normalized on the current examination with treatment and the symptoms of optic neuritis have resolved.
