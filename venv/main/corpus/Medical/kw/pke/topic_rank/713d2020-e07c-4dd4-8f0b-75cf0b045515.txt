Gait disturbance and muscle weakness
Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis
&#913; 65 year old man presents with a gait disturbance.
This man had a PMH of melanoma.  The diagnosis of melanoma was established on 2005 by an inguinal lymph node biopsy. The primary site of melanoma is unknown. The patient himself hasn't noticed any suspicious nevus. Perhaps the primary melanoma underwent a form of regression.

CSF cytology is positive for melanoma.
