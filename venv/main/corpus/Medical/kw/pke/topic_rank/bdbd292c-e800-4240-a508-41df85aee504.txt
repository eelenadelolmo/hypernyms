The patient reports having mononucleosis in September with diffuse cervical adenopathy.  In December she reports resolution of cervical lymphadenopathy and malaise but complains of an enlarging non-tender anterior neck mass over the last two weeks.  She denies trauma to her neck.
Presentation after infectious mononucleosis may have more that a casual relationship.  It may have percipitated progressive inflammation of the branchial cleft cyst.
