VS:  afebrile, HR 156, RR 55, O2 sat RA 98%, prior to bronchoscopy.
GEN:  NAD, resting comfortably
HEENT: NC/AT, no nasal flaring, no perioral cyanosis, MMM, anterior fontanelle is soft and non-bulging.
CHEST:  Diminished breath sounds over the right upper lobe.  No rales or rhonchi.  Mild expiratory wheeze while asleep.  Expiratory phase is not prolonged.  No accessor muscles use.
HEART:  Sinus rhythm on monitor.  No murmurs.  Hands and feet warm to touch.

LAB:  wnl
TREATMENT:
-Tracheostomy followed by mechanical ventilation. 
FOLLOW-UP:
-Schedule regular follow-up visits to assess pulmonary status
IMAGING CHARACTERISTICS:
-Enlarged air-filled right middle lobe and left upper lobe of the lungs.
-Compressive atelectasis of the right upper lobe.
-No evidence of septi or cyst walls within the expanded lobe
-Shift of the mediatinum away from the left upper lobe lesion.
-Widening of the rib interspaces of the affect side.
-Flattened hemidiaphragm.
-Involved lung herniates across anterior midline
-On lateral cxr, heart is displaced posteriorly with retrosternal lucency representing an anterior herniated lobe
Bilateral Congenital Lobar Emphysema
-Bronchial mucous plug with associated hyperaeration
-Extrinsic bronchial compression
-Agenesis/hypogenesis of contralateral lung
-Bronchial hypoplasia with air trapping peripherally
-Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation
-Pneumothorax
This patient is a 7 weeek old infant with history of noisy breathing.  The patient was born at 35 weeks gestation by SVD and remained in the nursery for 10 days without intubation.  Over the next 3 weeks, patients has had increased wheezing which worsens when he is excited.  
  Past medical and family history is unremarkable.  
  Medications:  none
The case was discussed with the pulmonologist who performed the bronchoscopy.  He felt strongly that the narrowiing of the bronchial tree precluded adequate ventilation without tracheostomy.  This patient will need careful followup post surgery to assure that the differential expansion normalizes, at least partially.
