Treatment for high-grade tumors include chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery.   Low grade tumors are treated surgically.
CT Chest 	
Mass-like expansion of the left pectoralis major muscle, with focal hypodensity within the substance of the muscle near the chest wall.
PET CT 		 
Hypermetabolic left anterior chest wall mass arising from the medial aspect of the pectoralis major muscle.  
Maximal SUV 10.11.
Soft tissue sarcoma
Tumor
Infection
Trauma
Painful mass of left pectoralis region.
Differential diagnosis for a chest wall mass include the broad categories tumor, infection and trauma.  Considering involvement primarily of the pectoralis muscle, the most likely etiology would be a soft tissue sarcoma; other considerations could include metastatic disease, however in this case, no additional focal abnormalities were noted.  Bone tumor with soft tissue mass is much less likely, due to disproportionate involvement of soft tissues.  Infection (phlegmon leading to abscess) may manifest in a patient with history of  penetrating trauma, or IV drug abuser, however a rim-enhancing fluid collection would be expected to be seen on contrast CT.  In a patient with onset of acute pectoralis pain during exercise (e.g. bench press, pushups), a muscle tear would be suspected; however, this would not erode underlying bone as seen in this case.
