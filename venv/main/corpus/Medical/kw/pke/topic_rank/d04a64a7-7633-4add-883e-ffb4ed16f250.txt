The gallbladder demonstrates a nonshadowing, nonmobile hypoechoic mass along the superolateral wall of the gallbladder, as well as a nonshadowing hyperechoic area along the lateral wall.  Decubitus images were performed which identified the hypoechoic superolateral mass as nonmobile, and the hyperechoic area as mobile.

59 yo woman with 6 month history of ascites.
While the mobile nonshadowing hyperechoic area on the lateral wall is consistent with sludge, the nonmobile nonshadowing hypoechoic mass adjacent to the superolateral wall could represent a polyp, cancer, or tumefactive sludge.  The mass lacks many of the characteristic features of gallbladder cancer (eccentric irregular wall thickening, infiltration of liver or vessels, bile duct obstruction, or associated lymphadenopathy) the size (>10 mm) makes this lesion worrisome for cancer.  The patient was scheduled for a CT scan to further evaluate the finding, with possible resection to follow pending the results of the CT scan.
