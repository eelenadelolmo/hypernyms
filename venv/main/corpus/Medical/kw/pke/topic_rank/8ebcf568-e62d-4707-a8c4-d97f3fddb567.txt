A small focus of late acute hemorrhage is noted within the cord exhibiting the signal characteristics of extracellular methemoglobin.  This hemorrhagic event may have been why the patient sought treatment.

Chronic hemorrhage within the cord is more common with AVMs, which leads to low signal on Gradient echo sequences.  An acute hemorrhage may mask the presence of chronic hemosiderin on spin echo sequences.
