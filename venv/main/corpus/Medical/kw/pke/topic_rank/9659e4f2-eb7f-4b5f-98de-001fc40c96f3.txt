Sagittal T1-weighted MR images demonstrate soft tissue lesion whose   the contents  cannot be clarified. In addition a curved   vessel is seen connecting the superior sagittal sinus with the encephalocele.
Parietal Atretic Encephalocele
• Encephalocele
• Sinus pericranii
•
The newborn has a small skin-covered midline parietal, 2  cm cephalad to lambda, subscalp cyst that ruptured during labor .
The findings are typical of atretic encephalocele.  They are typically parietal in location and contain meninges and neural rests. A vertically positioned straight sinus is commonly associated with these malformations, and anomalies of the tentorial incisura and superior sagittal sinus have also been reported.  Atretic encephaloceles contain a fibrous stalk at their base that connects to the dura mater.
