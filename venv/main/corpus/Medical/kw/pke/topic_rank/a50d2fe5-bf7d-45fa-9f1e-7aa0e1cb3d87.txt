Physical exam shows a thin and athletic female with no apparent distress.  Examination of the right hip shows significant pain with flexion and internal rotation, which replicates the chronic pain she has been experiencing.  There is an audible and palpable popping of her psoas tendon with hip flexion and extension.  The most severe pain is elicited from impingement testing with flexion and internal rotation.  There is also tenderness directly over the posterior iliac wing on the right side, with bruising over the location.
The plan is to let the iliac wing fracture heal on its own with conservative therapy and is considered non-surgical.  After the MR arthrogram results were reviewed it was determined that the patient would be able to complete the dance season without significant risk of further injury or disability.
Radiograph of the pelvis shows a subtle, non-displaced right iliac wing fracture and a fairly significant cam lesion on the right femoral neck. MR arthrogram of the right hip confirms the CAM lesion of the femoral head and neck junction and associated anterior superior labral tear measuring approximately 1 cm in length with near complete separation from the acetabular rim.
Right hip femoral acetabular impingement, right hip anterior superior labral tear, right iliopsoas snapping syndrome, right iliac wing fracture
-Femoral acetabular impingement
-Labral tear
-Coxa saltans(snapping hip  syndrome)
-Greater trochanteric bursitis
This 14 yo girl presents with two issues with her right hip pain.  The acute problem began 6 days ago, after she slipped on the hallway floor and fell down 12 steps, landing on her right hip.  Since this time she has had significant pain over the posterior iliac region, which has remained stable since the time of injury.  She has attempted to use crutches when ambulating without any significant amelioration of her pain.  

She is a competitive dancer.  With regard to her chronic problem, the patient complains of several years of substantial right hip pain located in the groin region and significant popping of the joint.  The pain is worse with activity, especially dancing, but does not seem to be associated with the popping.  She does not complain of pain in the left hip.
Future plans will involve a right hip surgical dislocation with a greater trochanteric advance, a right femoral neck osteo-chondroplasty, and an iliopsoas release.
