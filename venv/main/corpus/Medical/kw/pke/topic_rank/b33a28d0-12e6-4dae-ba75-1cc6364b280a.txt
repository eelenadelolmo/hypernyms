An 18-year-old football player presents with a chief complaint of chronic left shoulder pain and decreased range of motion.  The patient reported a history of a traumatic dislocation two years ago for which the patient received no follow up treatment. The patient claims his shoulder has "fallen out of its socket" several times in the last six months.
