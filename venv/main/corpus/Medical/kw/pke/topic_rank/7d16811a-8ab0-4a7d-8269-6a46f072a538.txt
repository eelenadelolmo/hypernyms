No tenderness to palpation, but difficulty walking and pain with internal rotation of the right hip.
Patient was referred to Orthopedics for definite care, which required surgery due to small 1 mm osseus fragment (not shown) within the joint.
1. X-rays: Subtle irregularity of the right superior lateral acetabulum.  Linear lucency overlying and extending past the right femoral head which is present on both AP and frogleg views.

2. CT: Vertical fracture which extends the length of the posterior acetabulum, best visualized on the coronal view.
Acetabular Fracture - Posterior Vertical
Normal (if lucency artifact)
Femur fracture
Acetabular fracture
17 year-old male with pain in right hip and limp after fall during football practice.
Recognition that the visualized lucency was not a line (Mach effect) but instead a stripe and extended past the borders of the femoral head led to the correct diagnosis.  The CT was obtained for confirmation, and used low radiation (56 mA) as high resolution was not necessary.
