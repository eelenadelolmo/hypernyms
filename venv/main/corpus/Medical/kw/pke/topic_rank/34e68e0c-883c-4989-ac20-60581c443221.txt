asymptomatic for this finding. Normal LFTs.
no specific treatment, except reassurance.
Follow up only if symptomatic or suspicion for other disease process.
CT: ill-defined right anterior hepatic lobe lesion, which is essentially iso-intense, sub-capsular, and does not enhance more than remainder of liver;
Tc-99m Sulfur Colloid scan: no abnormal distribution of radio-labeled sulfur colloid (neither "hot", nor "cold") in distribution of CT lesion.
Focal Nodular Hyperplasia
infection
HCC
Hepatic Adenoma
Incidental discovery on ABD CT for unrelated pain of ill-defined right anterior lobe hepatic lesion.
Had this nuclear scan exhibited a "hot" area that corresponded with the CT finding, this lesion would have been more exemplary of a FNH lesion. As FNH foci can have variable amounts of intrinsic Kupffer cell populations (the target cell in the sulfur colloid scan, then FNH could exhibit a "hot", "cold" or, as in this case, an "iso" uptake of activity, as compared to surrounding hepatic tissues and their Kupffer cells. A corresponding cold lesion would have been more characteristic (or have required inclusion in the differential) the possibilities of abscess/infection, HCC or a cyst.
