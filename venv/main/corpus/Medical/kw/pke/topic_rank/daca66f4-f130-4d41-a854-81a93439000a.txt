1) Determine Degree of Severity of Deformity, as well as Rule Out Associated Anomalies (Cardiac Arrhythmia, Mobius Syndrome, Klipel-Feil Syndrome).  Use Physical Exam and CT Scan.
2) Aggressive Occupational Therapy for Development of Hand Strength.
3)  Chest Reconstruction with Tissue Expander and Latissimus Dorsi Flap (if Latissimus Dorsi is present).  Tissue Expanders are recommended only if the patient is mature enough to accept a foreign body, and may be used until the patient is old enough to tolerate a more definitive repair.  
4)  Hand Reconstructive Surgery as possible.
A plain film portable view of the lungs demonstrate that they are well expanded and clear.  The cardiothymic silhouette and pulmonary vascularity are within normal limits.  The right lung is more lucent than the left, with absence of the pectoralis shadow. 

A portable plain film view of the right hand was performed and demonstrates deformity of the 2nd and 3rd phalanges.  The metacarpals are all present and normal.  The proximal phalanges of all digits are present.  The distal phalanges of all digits appear present.  However, the middle phalanges of all digits are not visualized.  There is radial deviation of all digits of the metacarpophalangeal joints with ulnar deviation of the distal thumb, index finger and middle finger.  There is significant overlap of soft tissues especially on the radial side and evaluation of soft tissues is limited.  Fusion of the soft tissues may be present.

1 day old male is presenting for radiological evaluation of apparent hand deformity (noticed by the mother).
Poland Syndrome is a constellation of ipsilateral deformities. It includes absence of the pectoralis major, hypoplasia and/or aplasia of breast or nipple, deficiency of subcutaneous fat and axillary hair, abnormalities of rib cage, and upper extremity anomalies; short upper arm, forearm, or fingers (brachysymphalangism). It may also include hypoplasia or aplasia of serratus, external oblique, pectoralis minor, latissimus dorsi, infraspinatus, and supraspinatus muscles, total absence of anterolateral ribs and herniation of lung, symphalangism with syndactyly and hypoplasia or aplasia of the middle phalanges.  This current case presents with ipsilateral right sided syndactyly, nipple hypoplasia, upper extremity anomalies and pectoralis aplasia.

Poland syndrome is uncommon with between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 100,000 diagnosed.  The right side is affected twice as often as the left.  Some cases have been described in twins, suggesting a genetic component.  However, the current theory is based on a subclavian vascular accident during the sixth week of gestation. 

Some associated anomalies are present, such as Mobius Syndrome and Klippel-Feil syndrome.  Malignancies, such as Leukemia and Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma are rarely associated with this syndrome.

Prognosis of this syndrome is good, with many being satisfied with the aesthetic result of these surgeries.
