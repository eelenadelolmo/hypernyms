The patient is a tall well developed but thin man.   A diastolic murmur can be appreciated at auscultation.
Surgically repair of the ascending aorta and aortic valve
MRI Findings include the following:

1. Markedly dilated proximal aorta with the aortic sinus measuring 5.7 x 5.7 cm, annulus measuring 4.3 cm, sinotubular junction measuring 3.9 cm and the mid ascending aorta measuring 3.0 cm. Mild aortic regurgitation. 

2. Dilated left ventricle ( End diastolic diameter 7.5cm) with preservation of systolic function, ejection fraction measuring 52%. 

3. Moderate mitral regurgitation measuring 37% of left ventricular stroke volume.  

4. Posterior mitral valve leaflet prolapse.
Marfan Syndrome
Possible Diagnosis includes:

Ehlers–Danlos syndrome
FragileX syndrome
Gigantism
Acromegaly
Hyperpituitarism
Hyperthyroidism 
Klinefelter syndrome
Congenital contractural arachnodactyly
Loeys-Deitz syndrome 
Familial thoracic aortic dissection
MASS syndrome (an inheritable genetic disease affecting the connective tissue involving   the Mitral valve, Aorta, Skeleton, and Skin)
Mitral valve prolapse syndrome
Familial ectopia lentis
Weill–Marchesani syndrome 
Shprintzen–Goldberg syndrome
Congenital arachnodactyly
A 30 year old man presents with intermittent back pain with exertion.  His job involves heavy lifting, and the pain is interfering with his ability to work. The pain radiates to his neck and head and resolves with rest.  The episodes of pain have increased in frequency and intensity over the last few months. 

He states that his mother died at the age of 41 from a “ruptured aorta,” and that he is worried the same thing will happen to him.
