Physical exam was normal
Pregnancy test (bHCG) negative
Serum Prolactin was elevated (>1005 ng/mL)
The patient is receiving bromocriptine and is responding to therapy.
High-resolution contrast-enhanced MRI depicts a small hypointense lesion, measuring 0,2 x 0,2 x 0,4 cm, against a hyperintense background of normally enhancing pituitary gland.
Pituitary microadenoma
Differential diagnosis includes:  Pituitary microadenoma, Rathke cleft cyst, pars intermedia cyst, craniopharyngioma, pituitary hyperplasia.
A 33-year old woman presents with mentrual cycle abnormalities and galactorrhea.
This was a case of a typical pituitary microadenoma more slowing enhancing than normal pituitary gland, although dynamic contrast-enhanced MR Imaging was not used. Despite the signal intensity abnormalities it is also useful to look for morphologic abnormalities such as,   localized bulging and depressions of the sellar floor, thinning or blistering of the sellar walls and deviation of the pituitary infundibulum.
