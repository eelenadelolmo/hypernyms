34 yo Hispanic female G3P0 needs work up for recent infertility.
Asherman's syndrome is the presence of intrauterine adhesions that typically occur as a result of scar formation after uterine surgery, especially after a dilatation and curettage (D&C). The adhesions may cause amenorrhea and/or infertility.

Uterine adhesions are usually due to endometrial trauma during pregnancy, such as postpartum or postabortal curettage, or mechanical evacuation of a live or dead fetus. Curettage after a missed abortion is also a relatively frequent cause of adhesions. Rarely, curettage in a nonpregnant uterus results in adhesions. Other rare causes include severe endometritis, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, postmyomectomy fibrosis, or Caesarian delivery.

Symptoms include disrupted fertility (infertility), spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and premature delivery) and menstrual dysfunction (irregular or absent menses). Endocervical adhesions can present as a cyclic pelvic pain due to blood in uterus.  

The diagnosis is confirmed by hysterosalpingography or hysteroscopy. The major hysterographic finding is a persistent filling defect of variable size in the endometrial cavity. There may be multiple defects, and in advanced cases the endometrial cavity becomes irregular and deformed. Adhesions at the internal os may result in failure of opacification of the endometrial cavity. 

Treatment options include laser or electrocautery dissection, under direct hysteroscopic visualization. After scar tissue is removed, the uterine cavity must be kept open while it heals to prevent recurrence of the adhesions. This is usually done with a balloon.
