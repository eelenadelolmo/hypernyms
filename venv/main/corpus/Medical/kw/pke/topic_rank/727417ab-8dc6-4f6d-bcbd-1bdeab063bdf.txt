Multiple, hard, palpable masses on the 4th and 5th digits.
In childhood, the cartilaginous lesions are subject to pathologic fractures, and in adults they are at risk for malignant transformation.  Therefore, serial radiographs are recommended to document the extent of growth and possible malignant transformation that may occur.
Multiple well defined, expansile, heterogeneously lytic, central lesions throughout the 4th and 5th metacarpals and phalanges, consistent with multiple enchondromas.
Ollier's disease
Ollier’s disease
Maffuci’s Syndrome
Multifocal fibrous dysplasia
Multiple palpable masses on the 4th and 5th digits.
This is a very typical radiograph for a patient with Ollier’s disease.  On radiographs, linear or columnar translucencies in the metaphyses and in the flat bones represent sites of persistent cartilaginous tissue.  In some instances, erosion and proliferation of the bones surface are seen.  Some of the lesions may regress or disappear during the years of growth.  Multiple, asymmetrically distributed intraosseous cartilaginous foci and subperiosteal deposition of cartilage are found either exclusively or predominantly involving one side of the body; the affected bones often are shortened and deformed.  The chondromas in Ollier’s disease predominate in the extremities, although the flat bones, especially those in the pelvis, are also affected.  
In childhood, the cartilaginous lesions are subject to pathologic fractures, and in adults they are at risk for malignant transformation.  Therefore, serial radiographic follow up is recommended.  
If there had been multiple soft tissue hemangiomas, evident by phleboliths and calcifications within the soft tissues, this would be diagnostic of Mafucci’s Syndrome
