Initial Labs:
Hemoglobin 10.3 m/uL
Hematocrit 29.2 %
Normal Reticulocyte Counts, Iron, TIBC and Iron Saturation.

Labs after CT of the abdomen and pelvis:
CA 125:  1365 (0-34 U/mL)
Patient in pending evaluation by Gynecology Oncology.
Contrast enhanced axial images of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate a soft tissue density in lower abdomen between the abdominal wall and small bowel consistent with an omental cake.  

A fluid collection in the pelvis with a cystic lesion in the left ovary is demonstrated.
Ovarian Cancer
Ovarian Cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis
Metastatic disease from occult colon or stomach cancer
74 year old white female with normocytic, normochromic anemia.  Evaluation for lymphoma.
The CT of the abdomen and pelvis in this case carried the provisional diagnosis of lymphoma.  The patient's examination did not demonstrate evidence of lymphadenopathy.  

Omental cake represents soft tissue attenuation that can occur within the peritoneum from metastatic disease from ovarian, gastric or colon malignancy.  With the constellation of peritoneal fluid and a cystic appearance to the left ovary, ovarian cancer was the most likely diagnosis.  Subsequent ultrasound of the abdomen demonstrated a complex fluid collection within the culdesac but no identifiable cysts or additional information.  

CA 125 is expressed by coelomic epithelium in fetal development and is most often expressed by epithelial ovarian cancer.  It can, however, be expressed in other malignancies.

Subsequently, a CA 125 was drawn and was strongly positive and suggestive for ovarian cancer.  This tumor marker has been used as an adjunct in postmenopausal women with asymptomatic pelvic masses.  Levels greater than 65 units per mL have a positive predictive value of 98 percent for ovarian cancer.
