ultrasound shows a heterogeneous isoechoic mass with echogenic rim.
The peripheral nodular enhancement on CT is pathognomonic of a Hemangioma
The U/S characteristics are nonspecific, and a reasonable differential diagnosis would include
Hemangioma, FNH, adenoma, HCC, metastasis, and lymphoma.
49 year old female with incidental lesion on CT please evaluate with ultrasound.
The liver lesion was a nonspecific incidental finding on an earlier unenhanced CT study.  At that time an ultrasound was recommended for further evaluation.  However, on the same day as the ultrasound, the patient was undergoing a contrast CT of the chest contrast for different reasons.  The submitted CT image is from that study. Although not a 3 phase CT, the characteristics shown on the single obtained phase are sufficient for the diagnosis of a hemangioma. The CT and US images were made available at the same time.
