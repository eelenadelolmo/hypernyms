This patient was enrolled in the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center P6 protocol for DSRCT that was the standard of therapy at that time. This protocol involved seven rounds of combination chemotherapy with surgery occurring after the third round of treatment and then an autologous stem cell transplant at the end of the treatment cycle. This patient also received aggressive post-surgical radiation therapy of 3,000 cGy. 
   The patient initially tolerated the therapy well, but was found to have tumor recurrence within a year of ending the protocol. The subsequent treatment course encountered multiple complications that lead to urosepsis and eventually the death of the patient 2 years and 11 months after the initial diagnosis.
