T2 weighted axial MR image reveals a well-marginated mass with smooth borders in the left lung at the level of the aortic arch, which demonstrates multiple small foci of increased T2 signal intensity, giving the mass a speckled appearance.

Contrast enhanced axial CT image shows a homogeneous, well-marginated, solid mass with minimal contrast enhancement in the left upper lobe.  No fat or calcification is evident.
Atypical Pulmonary Hamartoma
• Tuberculoma
• Metastatic Disease
• Carcinoid Tumor
• Adenocarcinoma
• Small-cell carcinoma
• Pulmonary hamartoma
58 yo man presented with neck pain to his primary care physician.  An MRI of the cervical spine was obtained revealing an abnormal finding.
The biopsy demonstrated cartilage lobules without intervening stroma, and  sparse cellularity.  Additionally, respiratory epithelium was visualized lining the margin of the mass and invaginating into the mass forming multiple small cystic areas, with fat tissue intermixed within adjacent respiratory epithelium, consistent with chondromatous hamartoma.
