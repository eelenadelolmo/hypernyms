Uterine size appropriate for LMP dates.  Normal, dopplerable fetal heart tones.
Given both the relatively young age of the mother and the absence of other fetal abnormalities on sonography, the likelihood of the fetus' having a chromosomal abnormality was deemed extremely low.
  
The patient followed up in the high-risk Obstetrics Clinic, where a level 2 ultrasound examination revealed no other abnormalities.  Following an uneventful third trimester of pregnancy, the patient delivered a healthy baby boy.
Transverse sonographic images through the fetal head, at the level of the lateral ventricles, without and with measurements, show bilateral fluid-filled structures surrounded by normal choroid plexus tissue within the lateral ventricles.

No other fetal abnormalities were detected.
Choroid plexus cysts
These findings are essentially pathognomonic for choroid plexus cysts (CPCs).
This G2P0 female patient presents for a routine second trimester obstetrical ultrasound (fetal survey).  At the time of the examination, the fetus' estimated gestational age based on the date of the mother's last menstrual period was twenty weeks and 3 days.
Please see the accompanying factoid.
