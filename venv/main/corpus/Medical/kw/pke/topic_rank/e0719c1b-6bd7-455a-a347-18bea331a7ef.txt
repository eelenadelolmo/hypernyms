Median arcuate ligament syndrome
19 year old man with long history of abdominal pain following meals presents with cachexia
The anatomically abnormality that leads to median arcuate ligament syndrome is an abnormally tight aortic hiatus. In such patients, when the aorta moves upward during expiration, the celiac axis is pinched against the relatively immobile median arcuate ligament.  The repetitive trauma to the endothelium of the artery over time leads to subintimal fibrosis and arterial stenosis.  This is the same pathology that causes other more common entrapment syndromes.
