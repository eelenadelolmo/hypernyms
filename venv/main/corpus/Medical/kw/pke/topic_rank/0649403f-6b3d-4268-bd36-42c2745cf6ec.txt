One point to consider in the evaluation of these patients is the timing of the contrast enchanced soft tissue neck CT.  The patients are frequently imaged emergently in the Emergency Room due to concern for abscess.  CT is very accurate at making this distenction, but the initial CT rarely changes clinical management.  Phlegmon and abscess are managed clinically with antibiotics for 24-48 hours before drainage is considered in most cases.  If the patient is clinically stable, CT can be postponed until the patient has received a trial of IV antibiotics.   This will decreased the amount of CT's actually required.
