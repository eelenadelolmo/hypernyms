Pain with passive motion of the left hip joint
Patient made non-weightbearing; orthopedic consult placed; patient had operative stabilization with 3 canulated lag screws and is currently recovering / healing.
Pelvis radiograph (fig 1a) demonstrates a subtle oblique area of sclerosis at the base of the left femoral neck, new from the prior exam (fig 1b).  Nuclear medicine bone scan (fig 2) demonstrates intense activity in the area of sclerosis.  MRI (figs 3,4) reveals a band of signal loss in the marrow (with associated surrounding marrow T2 hyperintensity) corresponding to the radiographic finding.
