The two images submitted show vascular access catheters.  The first image is of a Mahurkar large-bore tunneled catheter.  The second image is of a peripherally-inserted central catheter (PICC).

Tunneled catheters are utilized to provide long-term vascular access.  A cuff on the catheter causes scar tissue formation, anchoring the device.  The cuff also helps prevent migration of bacteria up the catheter.  Tunneled catheters come in single to triple lumen designs, and are available in multiple sizes.  These devices are appropriate when frequent, prolonged use is anticipated and high flow rates are needed.  Some restrictions are needed when wearing one of these devices (swimming), and some daily or weekly care is required.

Other vascular catheters are available with large bores and multiple ports.  Triple lumen vascular access catheters are frequently placed for short-term use.  These devices are sutured in place and do not have a cuff to invoke scar formation.

PICC lines offer central vascular access with relative ease of placement.  These lines can easily be removed, although they can stay in for months if properly maintained.  Because of their length, high flow rates are not easily achieved.
