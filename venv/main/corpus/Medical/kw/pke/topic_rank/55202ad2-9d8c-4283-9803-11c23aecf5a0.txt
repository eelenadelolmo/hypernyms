hypertonic with opisthotonic posturing, a very high-pitched cry, significant jaundice and icterus.  No hepatomegaly.

Total Bilirubin: 42.2 (<16 mg/dL)  Indirect Bilirubin: 41.5 (0.1-0.7 mg/dL)  RBCs: 3.43 (4.10-6.70 10x6/mm3) Hemoglobin: 10.5 (15.0-24.0 g/dL)  Hematocrit: 30.4 (44-70%)  MCV: 88.6 (102-115fL)  G6PD quant: 1.8 (4.6-13.5 U/g Hgb)
Exchange transfusion is a definitive therapy used to mechanically remove already formed bilirubin from the blood.  It is indicated whenever clinical signs of bilirubin encephalopathy are present, in patients with critically high bilirubin (>25 mg/dL), or when the bilirubin continues to rise despite attempts to reduce it.  Phototherapy induces a conformational change in the bilirubin molecule, rendering it water-soluble and therefore increases its excretion through the kidneys and also non-lipophilic.  Total serum bilirubin needs to be kept under 20 mg/dL.
MRI T2 FLAIR (2/25/08)  -  small amount of hemorrhage in the extra-axial spaces of the posterior fossa, consistent with recent vaginal delivery
- otherwise normal MRI of brain.

MRI T2 FLAIR (5/6/08) – Subtle prolongation in the globi pallidi bilaterally is present consistent with previous acute bilirubin encephalopathy.
