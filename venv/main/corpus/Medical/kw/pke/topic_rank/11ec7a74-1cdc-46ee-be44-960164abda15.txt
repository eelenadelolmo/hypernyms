Treatment for Crohn's is mainly for symptomatic patients to treat active/acute disease by treating infection and reducing inflammation. The goal of treatment is then to maintain remission and avoid flares. Surgery is reserved for complications of the disease such as obstruction, abscesses or failure to respond to medical treatment.
Spot and Overhead images demonstrate a long segment of stricturing of the terminal ileum with separation of bowel loops. The bowel loops in the right lower quadrant were not as mobile on real time fluoroscopy. There is associated proximal dilatation of the distal ileum prior to the strictured region.
