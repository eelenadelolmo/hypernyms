High-resolution CT through the petrous bone in axial section shows a cystic cochleovestibular malformation of both ears.  The bilateral cochlear turns are incomplete with a small appearance of the apex (last cochlear turn).  The bilateral semicircular canals are abnormal with dilatation of the posterior and lateral semicircular canals. The vesibule is dilated on both sides.  The vestibular aqueduct appears normal.
The findings are bilateral although more pronounced on the right.
Mondini deformity, incomplete partition type I.
Mondini Deformity.
Large vestibular aqueduct syndrome (can be isolated only to vestibular aqueduct or can be associated with cochlear and vestibular dysplasia)
Cochlear hypoplasia (associated with one large cavity between coclea and vestibule)
Michel's Aplasia (complete lack of formation.  Cock's Deformity).
Pendred syndrome.
9 year old male with left-sided sensorineural hearing loss.
These CT results were reviewd as Mondini deformity, incomplete partition type I (IP-I).  Incomplete partition type I is defined as a malformation in which the cochlea lacks the entire modiolus and interscalar septa, resulting in a cystic appearance and there is an accompanying grossly dilated vestibule.  

At first glance, the overall cochlea in this anomaly shows no significant difference from normal findings.  Close inspection demonstrates the small size of the superior aspect or final turn of the cochlea.  Only the internal architecture is different.  Inspection of the semicircular canals is important since the can also be abnormally dilated (as in this case).
