Case 17 (27th Annual Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, 2003) CUTANEOUS CARTILAGINOUS REST OF THE NECK (WATTLE)
History: 39 year-old Caucasian male with a right neck lesion that has been present since birth, but recently became bothersome because it would rub on the collar of his shirt. The initial impression to his primary care doctor was thought to be a benign nevus. A shave biopsy was performed at the patient's request.
