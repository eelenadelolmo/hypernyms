Laboratory values (LFT's, bilirubin studies) were normal at the time of the study.  Patient was relatively weak. Biliary T-tube in place, with yellow fluid draining freely.
The T-tube stayed in place following the procedure.  The patient is undergoing further evaluation in managing the existing stones.
A 7mm stone is seen in the distal common bile duct.  Two 5-6 mm stones are seen in the right intrahepatic duct, and one 7mm stone in the left intrahepatic duct.  A T-tube is in place. Cholecystectomy surgical clips are seen on this T-tube cholangiogram.

62 year old female 2.5 weeks post-op following open cholecystectomy and common bile duct exploration.  A T-tube was placed at the time of surgery.  The patient was asymptomatic at the time of exam, but she experienced intermittent pain when the T-tube was clamped.
The patient's intrahepatic biliary system displayed a "pruned tree" appearance.  This can be seen in patients with cirrhosis, or may indicate chronic cholangitis (this is the case in this patient).
