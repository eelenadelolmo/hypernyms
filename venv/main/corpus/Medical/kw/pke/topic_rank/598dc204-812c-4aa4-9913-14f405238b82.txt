Na, K, Cl, CO2, Glucose, BUN, Creatinine, CA, drawn on the same day the CT scan was taken were all normal.
Pt is currently not receiving treatment but is being worked up followed with serial CT scans due to unexplained weight loss.
1. The parenchyma of the lung demonstrates bilateral upper lobe predominant fibrotic changes with interlobular septal thickening. 2.  Numerous 1 cm nodular densities with in the periphery.
3.  As well as dominant fibrotic masses at the end of the bronchovascular bundle on the right side seen best on image #16 measuring 3.6 cm x 1.7 cm and on the left upper lobe seen best on image #10 measuring 2.4 cm X 1.8 cm with associated traction bronchiectasis, as well as some sparse areas of effected regions within the superior segments of the lower lobes bilaterally as well as the right middle lobe, which appears to have not changed significantly in comparison with the prior CT scan performed on 27 Feb 2002.
4.  No evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
5.  Mediastinum demonstrates no evidence of lymphadenopathy pathologic by size criteria.  
6.  No evidence of axillary lymphadenopathy pathologic by size criteria.
Sarcoidosis
Nodular Interstitial Pattern: Granulomatous diseases both infectious (TB, Fungal, Bacteria, Atypical mycobacterium) and non- infectious (Sarcoidosis, Vasculitis-granulomatosis diseases, Histiocytosis) Hematogenous spread of malignancy, and, Pneumoconiosis.
History (can include gestational age, or age in days, weeks, months):
70 y/o female for follow up CT scan to monitor for any pulmonary changes due to a recent 15lb weight loss, otherwise asymptomatic.
Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology that can affect multiple systems; the presence of noncaseating granulomas in the involved organs is what characterizes it pathologically.  Sarcoidosis is estimated to have a prevalence of 10-20 per 100,000 and is 3-4 times more common in African Americans than Caucasians.  The most common target of sarcoidosis is the lungs, around 90% of all patients with sarcoidosis have lung involvement, resulting in the main symptoms including cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and the less common features include fatigue, weakness, malaise, fever, and weight loss.  Sarcoidosis, when in its extrapulmonary form, can result in a plethora of other complaints depending on the organ system affected.  But approximately 50% of those with sarcoidosis are asymptomatic at the time it is discovered.  The treatment for sarcoidosis is not straightforward.  It is typically agreed upon that treatment should begin if the patient is symptomatic, if lung function is deteriorating, or the radiological findings associated with sarcoidosis are worsening.  The current primary treatment is with daily oral corticosteroids.  The best dose is not known so a dose must be chosen by balancing the risk of adverse effects versus the benefits of therapy.  Treatment typically lasts between 6 to 12 months.
