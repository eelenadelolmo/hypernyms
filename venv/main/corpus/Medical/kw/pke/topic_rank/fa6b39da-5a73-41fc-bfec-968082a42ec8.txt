Pt was admitted for diagnositic laporoscopy with resection of obstructed diverticulum that was confirmed by pathology.  Pt recovered well from the operation and was discharged shortly.
• Within the pelvis, just posterior to the uterus and just to the right of the midline, there is a 1.9 cm round mass with an internal air-fluid level and some enteric contrast material present within.  
• The density of the enteric contrast material within the lesion is somewhat less than that of the surrounding small bowel.  
• There is no mesenteric inflammatory change surround this lesion.   
• The appendix is not definitely identified on this examination.  No secondary signs of appendiceal inflammation are noted.  
• The bowel loops otherwise demonstrate normal attenuation and configuration throughout.  
• There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.

42 year old female with a 10 day history of lower abdominal/pelvic pain and dysuria despite antibiotic therapy for presumed cystitis
While Meckel's Diverticulum is most common in children, it can present at any time.  When it presents in females it can mimic many gastroinestinal or genitourinary problems that may be difficult to differentiate clinically.  A Meckel's Scan is not very sensitive or specific in the adult population and an abdominal CT Scan is the imaging of choice to evaluate a patient with a possible Meckel's Diverticulum in an adult.
