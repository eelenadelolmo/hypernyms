Hand radiographs reveal pancarpal fusion with soft tissue swelling overlying the ulnar styloids.  Marginal erosions are seen at multiple MCP joints. Joint space narrowing can also be seen at the PIP and some DIP joints. 
Elbow radiographs demonstrate bilateral ulno-humeral joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis.

The proximal distribution of findings in the hands and the symmetric appearance of the findings are highly suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis.  Secondary OA can sometimes be seen in patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis.  This patient does have joint space narrowing of her DIP joints along with small osteophytes.
