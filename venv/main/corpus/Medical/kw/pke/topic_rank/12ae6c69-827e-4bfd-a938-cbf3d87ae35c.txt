Physical exam revealed no peritoneal signs.  Patient had a normal white blood cell count.
Patient subsequently had a mesenteric angiogram confirming the extent of mesenteric ischemia.
Contrast enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated interval development of 2 wedge shaped perfusion defects in the spleen and a segmental perfusion defect of the right kidney.  Vascular structures were remarkable for a filling defect within a long segment of the mid to distal superior mesenteric artery.  

Bowel wall enhancement was normal.  There was no wall thickening, thumbprinting or pneumatosis.  Diverticulosis was present without diverticulitis.

The aorta demonstrated dense calcification at the ostia of the celiac, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric and both renal arteries.
Acute mesenteric ischemia
Mesenteric ischemia:

Vasculitis
Embolic disease
Hematologic
Collagen vascular disease
Aortic dissection (less likely given the organs involved)
68 year old caucasian female presented with lower abdominal pain.  2 weeks ago she had presented with right lower quadrant pain but no etiology was discovered.

PMHx:  Atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, osteoporosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia
The etiology of mesenteric ischemia for the majority of cases is due to arterial occlusion;  venous disease is another cause. Embolic phenomena accounts for 50% while thrombotic etiologies account for 25% of cases.  The heart is the usual embolic source and embolism to the superior mesenteric artery accounts for 50% of cases.  More than 95% of patients with occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery have documented histories of cardiac disease.  

A majority of emboli will wedge at the branch points in the mid to distal superior mesenteric artery.  This event is often superimposed in the setting of atherosclerotic disease of the mesenteric vasculature.  Additonally the degree of collateral circulation dictates the extent of ischemia.  In the setting of adequate collateral circulation, bowel infarction may not develop, as was the case for this patient.


In older patients the etiology of splenic infarct is usually an embolic event.  Given the multiplicity of findings in this patient's case, the underlying etiology was patient's history of atrial fibrillation.  CT findings of splenic infarction include low attenuation areas which are typically described as wedge-shaped, peripherally located, and sharply marginated.  Imaging findings are variable, however, and the shape can vary between round, multinodular, heterogeneous, and poorly marginated.  Acutely the infarct is well demarcated whereas subacutely it is more isoattenuating and chronically the tissue appears atrophic.

Similar concepts apply with regard to contrast enhancement of the kidney in this patient.
