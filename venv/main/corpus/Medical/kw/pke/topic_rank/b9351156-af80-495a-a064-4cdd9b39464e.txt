1)  T1 SAGITTAL, CORONAL - 1.7 cm TRV x 2.5 cm CC x 2.1 cm AP, T1 isointense to gray matter, pituitary mass with extension into the suprasellar cistern and into the right cavernous sinus. There may also be infrasellar extension along a midline sphenoid sinus septum which is thickened.  
2)  T2 CORONAL - Sellar mass T2 isointense to gray matter. Mass effect on the optic chiasm and, in turn, the anterior cerebral arteries. 
3)  T1 CORONAL POST GAD - Heterogeneously-enhancing mass with a single internal well-circumscribed focus in its suprasellar aspect which is nonenhancing consistent with focal necrosis, hemorrhage, cystic degeneration.
