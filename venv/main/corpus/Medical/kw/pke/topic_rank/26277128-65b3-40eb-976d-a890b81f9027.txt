No treatment needed in this case.
Plain Radiograph, left tibia/fibula: mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion of the proximal tibia with a narrow zone of
transition and a thin distinct sclerotic border.  Otherwise, normal bones, joints and soft tissues.

MR: Well-circumscribed 4.7 x 2.0-cm lesion in the proximal medial metadiaphyseal region of the tibia. This demonstrates heterogeneous signal but is primarily intermediate on T1 and T2. It appears to be arising from the cortex with minimal cortical thickening in the adjacent region. The surrounding marrow demonstrates normal signal intensity with no adjacent stress fracture or marrow edema identified. No evidence of stress fracture. The distal femur is intact.
Nonossifying Fibroma
-Nonossifying fibroma (healing)
-Bone abscess
-periosteal chondroma
-chondromyxoid fibroma
-aneurysmal bone cyst
History of reported trauma left lower extremity, "please rule out fracture"
These lesions usually arise close to the physeal plate and are metaphyseal lesions. Without evolution they may extend into the diaphysis. Epiphyseal localization is unusual. Multifocal lesions are also very uncommmon. Symmetry of involvement is characteristic if bilateral. CT is useful for evaluating cortical thickness and medullary involvement and finding potential fractures.  MRI shows intermediate to low signal on both T1 and T2 weighted sequences.  Following administration of intravenous gadolinium, the lesions demonstrates a hyperintense border and signal enhancement. Low signal is seen on MR images during the healing phase with mineralization of the lesion. Most lesions involute (heal) as the patient ages. Pathologic fractures occassionally occur. Lesions that extend across more than 50% of the medullary cavity will usually be treated with curettage and bone grafting.
