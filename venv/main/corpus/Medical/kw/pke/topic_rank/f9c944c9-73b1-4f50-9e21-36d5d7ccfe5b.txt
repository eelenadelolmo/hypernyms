Decreasing hematocrit, left upper quadrant pain.
Uneventful recovery following coil embolization of spleen.
Contrast enhanced axial CT images of the abdomen show a wedge-shaped area of hypoattenuation within the spleen which extends to the splenic hilum, consistent with splenic laceration.  Minimal perisplenic and perihepaic blood is present.  Fluoroscopic spot images show selective catheterization of the splenic artery with heterogeneous contrast opacification of the splenic parenchyma.  No frank contrast extravasation is present.  Subsequent images show coils within the mid-portion of the splenic artery and significantly reduced/near absent perfusion of the spleen.

Splenic laceration, pathognomonic.
