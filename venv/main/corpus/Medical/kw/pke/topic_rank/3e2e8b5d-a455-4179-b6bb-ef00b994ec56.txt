Physical exam revealed a II/IV systolic ejection murmur. His lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion.
Following films, further history was obtained. The patient then revealed that he had had an intermittent cough productive of brown sputum. In addition, his sister, who lives with him, recently was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He denied fever or chills.

Therapy was begun with isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide
The pertinent findings are in the right chest. On the AP view, a 4 cm. cavitary lesion is present in the right upper lobe. In the right apex, there is increased density which is diffuse with sane linearity.

The minor fissure is somewhat elevated, the mediastinum is mildly shifted to the right, and the right hemidiaphragm is elevated. These findings
suggest loss of lung volume on the right.

The right costophrenic angle is blunted, and a meniscus may be seen at the right lateral base, suggesting an effusion.
These same findings are seen on the lateral view as well.
Reactivated Pulmonary Tuberculosis
Patient is a 62yo man who had several episodes of chest pain on exertion. Following a positive stress test, the patient was referred for cardiac catheterization.  On admission, the patient denied any respiratory symptoms. Past history was remarkable for pneumonia with a pleural effusion which was tapped in 1958.

As part of his precatheterization work-up, AP and lateral radiographs were done of his chest
Pulmonary tuberculosis may be primary or secondary (reactivated).

Primary is usually asymptomatic. Radiographically, there may be a patchy middle lobe infiltrate and hilar adenopathy. If present, these signs usually resolve without therapy. Scarring may occur, forming a Ghon complex. This consists of a parenchymal granuloma and a calcified regional lymph node.

Reactivated or secondary tuberculosis is that which is seen in this patient. Symptoms include chronic cough and blood-tinged sputum. It is most common in the elderly, as it represents reactivation of a previous (often many years old) primary infection. Radiographically, increased apical density, upper lobe cavitary lesions, volume loss, and pleural effusions are all commonly seen. The process is frequently bilateral, although unilaterality (as with this patient) is not uncommon.

Rarely, either of these may progress to military tuberculosis, which presents with many small nodules in both lung fields.

In addition to the radiographic and clinical signs, the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis also requires positive laboratory findings. Staining of sputum for acid fast bacilli and culture of sputum are the most commonly used tests. In this patient, the AFB smear was positive while the culture was still pending.

Without therapy, primary tuberculosis frequently heals, leaving only the Ghon complex,(and the possibility of reactivation). Secondary and miliary disease, however, is more serious. Approximately 60% of those with reactivated pulmonary tuberculosis die of their disease if it is left untreated. The disease takes a slaw, progressive course, eventually leading to generalized wasting and death. The average time from diagnosis to death in the untreated patient is about 2 1/2 years.

Fortunately, effective therapy does exist. This consists of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide. Treatment generally lasts for anywhere from six to twelve months. Following this regimen, greater than 90% of patients recover with no serious sequelae.
