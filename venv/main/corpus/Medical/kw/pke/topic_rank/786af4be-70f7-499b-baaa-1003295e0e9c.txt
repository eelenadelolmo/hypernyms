Delayed whole body images and spot views of the pelvis from a Tc99m-HDP osseous scintigraphy study show abnormal and asymmetric increased radiotracer activity at the left iliac wing.  While scintigraphy has a lower resolution than conventional radiography, expansion of the left iliac is nevertheless suggested on the bone scan.  Comparison to a prior CT exam of the pelvis as well a prior frontal radiograph of the abdomen helped to confirm a diagnosis of Paget's disease in this case, as these studies showed the classic findings of trabecular and cortical thickening and osseous expansion at this location.
Paget's Disease; confirmed by characteristic imaging findings.
Imaging findings are characteristic of Paget's disease of bone.
The patient is a 76 year-old man with a referred for a bone scan following a finding made on a recent CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis.
