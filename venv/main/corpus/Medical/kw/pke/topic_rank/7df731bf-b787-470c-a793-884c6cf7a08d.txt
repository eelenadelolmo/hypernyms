65 year old male presents to the primary care clinic with several weeks of vague abdominal pain, sometimes felt to increase with meals.
Celiac artery aneurysms are usually caused by atherosclerosis. Infection and trauma are also reported etiologies. While these aneurysms are considered quite rare, they may present with vague abdominal pain, as in this case, or merely as an incidental finding. In most cases surgery is the desired treatment to avoid rupture or thrombosis.
