Presumptive hemorrhagic ovarian cyst.

G0P0 female presents to the emergency room with acute onset of pelvic pain.
Hemmorhagic cysts are not an uncommon finding associated with pain.  While the more classic features of lace-like or chicken wire internal septations or a fluid-fluid level are not present in this case.  Keeping in mind a broader differential of complex cystic masses of the pelvis listed above in the differential (- ectopic pregnancies as the hCG was negative) is helpful in directing follow up.
