No focal neurological deficits.
Supportive, with continued control of hypertension and monitoring of INR for warfarin treatment.
Small lesion in left thalamus (dark CT, bright T2) 
Subcortical lesion (dark CT, bright T2) in the inferior right frontal lobe
Subacute infarction, Broca&#39;s area & arcuate fasciculus
Low grade glioma (astrocytoma Gr 2)
Lacunar infarction
Subcortical white matter infarct
Cortical MCA infarction
79 y.o. manÂ had 2 episodes (approx. 2 months apart) of sudden expressive aphasia (word finding difficulty) lasting 30 - 45 minutes - each with complete resolution. The first episode was in early four months ago; and, the most recent was three months ago.  He was labeled with a TIA diagnosis; and, had negative carotid US and negative echocardiograms (for thrombus) - but with a <50% carotid stenosis.

PMH - He has atrial fibrillation and has always been appropriately anticoagulated with warfarin.   He does not drink EtOH or smoke, he has medication-controlled hypertension.
Many patients with resolving neurologic deficits ("TIAs") actually have permanent imaging findings - as shown here in this case.  The subcortical infarction (old) is in the location of the frontal lobe and arcuate fasciculus, which may be the related to his two episodes of "word finding" problems.  http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/136/11/3451.full.pdf+html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcuate_fasciculus
-------------------  Additional History  ---------------
There was also one episode 18 months ago where he had transient blurry vision in one eye (can&#39;t remember which one) that lasted 3 - 4 hours with a negative exam by an ophthalmologist during the symptomatic phase. No recurrence of the ocular/vision issue.

The last piece of history is he was in a horrendous MVA (head-on collision, on the way to the beach) where someone crossed the double yellow in the opposite direction while turning on to the two lane road. This occurred several months after the one-time ocular event. He sustained a neck injury and Fx ribs - but without any loss of consciousness nor any CNS effects. Despite being fully anticoagulated, he did not have any bleeding. His residual effects are decreased range of motion in his cervical spine, primarily unable to completely turn his head to the right. His wife had multiple fractures as well. Both were cut out of their vehicle and airlifted to the hospital.
