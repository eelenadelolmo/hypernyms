Patient is a 21-month-old female, with no significant medical history, referred by her primary care physician for worsening right eye redness and droopy eyelid.  Two weeks prior to presentation, the patientâ€™s mother brought her to the primary care physician, after she had noticed tearing of the right eye and drooping of the right eyelid.  She was treated for conjunctivitis, but then returned ten days later due to worsening of the redness and tearing.  The patient was then referred to the ophthalmologist, who noted a right CN III palsy.
