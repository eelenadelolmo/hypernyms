Texto: 
Physical exam is significant for lack of a visible bulge, and there is no obvious inguinal hernia palpable bilaterally.
Patient consulted to Sports Medicine and General Surgery for consideration of conservative management versus surgical repair.
Dynamic CT, inguinal hernia protocol, obtained, with no evidence of inguinal hernia.
MRI obtained showing avulsion injury of rectus abdominis-adductor longus aponeurosis from the pubic symphysis bilaterally, though left more significant than right, with a split intra-substance tear.
Sports hernia, specifically avulsion of rectus abdominis-adductor longus aponeurosis
Sports Hernia
33 year old active-duty man with 3 month history of left sided groin pain.  Patient has pain even when lying in bed, and it is exacerbated with activities such as running.  No history of abdominal surgery or of previous inguinal hernia.
Athletic Pubalgia (specifically Sports Hernia)

Groin pain accounts for between 2-5% of all sports related injuries [1].  Athletic pubalgia refers to the group of musculoskeletal processes that occur in and around the pubic symphysis and that share similar mechanisms of injury and common clinical manifestations [2].  Athletic pubalgia tends to affect males more frequently than females, however when females have it they tend to have more severe symptoms [2].  It tends to be insidious onset, is exacerbated by physical activity, and patients tend to have symptoms for a long period of time prior to reaching a diagnosis [2,3].  The most common cause of athletic pubalgia is injury to the common aponeurosis of the rectus abdominis and adductor longus tendons [2].  Differential diagnosis for groin pain in an athlete is broad.  Potential causes of groin pain, other than athletic pubalgia include adductor longus tendinosis, osteitis pubis, pubic stress fracture, inguinal hernia, nerve entrapment syndromes, acetabular pathology including labral tears, as well as referred pain [1-5].

Imaging for patients with these complaints usually starts with pelvic radiographs, which are generally normal, which can be followed with CT or MRI [4].  In terms of MR Imaging, a useful technique is to first obtain an imaging survey of the pelvis for the initial evaluation.  Following immediate review of the survey, high-resolution small-field-of-view imaging can be obtained, focusing on regions with suspected pathologic change [2,5].  Certain regions, such as the inguinal canal, may be best imaged with dynamic sonography, though results tend to depend on the experience of the operator [4].

Treatment for athletic pubalgia is initially conservative, including rest, ice, and a short course of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, followed by physical therapy to restore function and correct movement deficiencies [2-4].  In cases where this is unsuccessful, steroid injections in the affected region are frequently attempted.  For patients who continue to have pain, surgical management can be directed at repairing a recognized site of injury [2,5].
