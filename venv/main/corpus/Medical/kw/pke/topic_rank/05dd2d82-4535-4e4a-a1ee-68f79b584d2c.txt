Regular Cardiology Follow Up
Abnormal left ventricular dilatation with noncompacted myocardium of the inferior and lateral walls of the mid ventricle as well as apex. The ratio of non compacted to compacted myocardium was measured at 2.4 in the short axis view of the left ventricle at the end of diastole. The patient was also noted to have a small ASD, and there were no noted abnormalities of the coronary vasculature.
Left Ventricular Non Compaction
--Physiologic trabeculations
--Left Ventricular Noncompaction
--Dilated cardiomyopathy
--Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
A 38 year old female presented to clinic with symptoms of new onset fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. The patient’s family history was significant for a brother with known history of cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death of the patient’s mother in her 40s.
This case illustrates the importance of screening patients with early onset of CHF symptoms and a family history of cardiomyopathy.  Although left ventricular noncompaction is typically more common in males, this patient demonstrated common presenting symptoms, with dyspnea on exertion and fatigue.  Patients with left ventricular noncompaction often exhibit symptoms of congestive failure.  

In this case, MDCT findings correlated well with with MR findings and could be used to establish the diagnosis independent of other modalities.
