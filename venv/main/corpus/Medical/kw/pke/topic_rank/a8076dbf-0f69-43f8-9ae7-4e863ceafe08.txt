There is minimal diffuse abdominal tenderness to deep palpation without palpable masses, rebound tenderness, or guarding.  The physical examination is otherwise noncontributory.

The complete blood count is remarkable for a hematocrit of 33.
A chest/abdomen/pelvis CT scan for staging was pending at the time of case submission.
An axial CT image through the pelvis following the administration of oral contrast shows excellent contrast-distention of the descending colon and proximal sigmoid colon with an apparent  focal area of circumferential colonic wall thickening involving an approximately 4 cm segment of sigmoid colon (in the left hemipelvis adjacent to the bladder).

Overhead and spot images from a gastrograffin enema show, within the sigmoid colon, a classic “apple core” lesion: a relatively short, sharply defined region of annular, constricting colonic narrowing with overhanging margins, ulcerated mucosa, and an eccentric and irregular lumen.
Annular Apple Core Colonic Lesion: a Differential Diagnosis.
Biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon.  Please see the accompanying factoid for a discussion of the differential diagnosis.
