Fat Sat coronal T2 shows symmetric enlargement of the extrinsic muscles of the eyes.  .  Axial contrast T1 image shows  enlargement and enhancement of the extrinsic eye muscles.  Together, the images demonstrate bilateral enlargment of the inferior, medial, superior, and, to a lesser extent, lateral rectus muscles.  Bilateral proptosis is present.  The tendinous insertions are normal. (The superior oblique muscles, not pictured, were normal).

Thyroid orbitopathy
Orbital pseudotumor
lymphoma
rhabdomyosarcoma
41 year old female with previously diagnosed metabolic abnormality.  Patient had scan ordered to better identify left superior oblique muscle after strabismus surgery.
The lack of involvement of the tendinous insertions helps differentiate this diagnosis from orbital pseudotumor.  the involvement of all the extrinsic muscles narrows the diagnosis immediately, although thyroid orbitopathy need not be symmetric.  In this case, the patient had known thyroid disease, taking some of the mystery out of the diagnosis.
