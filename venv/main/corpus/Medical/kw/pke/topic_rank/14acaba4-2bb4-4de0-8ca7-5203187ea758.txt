Consevatively managed
Ultrasound of scrotum  revealed  intra testicular hematoma/contusion with fracture lines,seen as hypoechoic lines which were seen crossing the tunica albuginea.
Mild asymmetry was also seen in the testicular contour which suggested rupture of the testis.

Moderate amount of haematocoele was also seen.
