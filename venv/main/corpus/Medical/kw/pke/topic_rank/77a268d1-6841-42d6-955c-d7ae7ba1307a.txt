PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a large spherical opacity 5 cm in diameter.  It is retrocardiac as it does not obscure the the left heart border on frontal view.  On lateral view, the opacity is seen to lie posteriorly in the left lower lobe

67 y/o WF with h/o of prior partial wedge resection of LLL for metastatic melanoma two years ago.
-  This patient's known previous metastatic melanoma to the lung makes this new large mass highly suspicious for recurrence of the melanoma.
-  The age of the patient, the size of the mass at presentation and its growth over an eight month time frame are consistent with malignant disease.
