Treatment is aimed at inhibiting osteoclastic activity through bisphosphonates.  Surgical intervention is indicated for pathologic fractures, advanced disabling arthritis, and extreme bowing deformities of the long bones.
Scout image reveals bowing of the left femur, with an osseous abnormality involving the distal femur.

AP and lateral radiograph of the left femur reveals a blade of grass appearance of osteoclastic activity in the mid-shaft  cortex with sharp borders, advancing along the shaft of the femur.  Additionally, bone remodeling with thickening of the cortex, and a coarse trabecular pattern in the medullary portion of the femur is noted.  There is also a increase in bone density, with diffuse sclerotic change, enlargement and widening of the epiphysis.  Bowing is evident.  

Frog leg radiograph of the left femur, reveals the blade of grass appearance of osteoclastic activity advancing along the shaft of the femur.
Paget Disease of Bone
Lymphoma 
Metastatic cancer
Familial idiopathic hyperphosphatasia (Juvenile Paget disease) where the articular ends of the bone may not be affected.  
Paget Disease
60 yo male for evaluation.
If laboratory markers had been drawn, one would expect increased levels of serum alkaline phosphatase with osteoblastic activity, and high urinary levels of hydroxyproline with osteoclastic activity.

Complications of Paget's disease include deformity of the long bones, warmth in the involved extremity, periosteal tenderness, bone pain, fractures, secondary osteoarthritis, neural compression, and sarcomatous degeneration.
