Urine culture grew E. coli.
Prophylactic antibiotic therapy.
Possible surgical correction with ureteral reimplantaion.
There is right grade II-III reflux (forniceal blunting with partial effacement of the papillary impression) with a normal axis of the collecting system.  The ureteral insertion was normal.  There is left grade II reflux (normal calyceal architecture with a normal papillary impression) into a low bifid ureter with symetric filling of both the upper and lower pole moieties of a duplex kidney.  The common distal ureter insertion is normally positioned.  There is no ureterocele in the bladder.
Vesicoureteral Reflux
Left partial duplex renal collecting system with low bifid ureter.
None.
7 y/o girl with resolving E. coli urosepsis.  The renal ultrasound was normal.
A clue to the fact that there is a bifid ureter on the left, rather than a complete duplication of the collecting system is that in complete duplication reflux into the upper pole is unusual and very unlikely to be simultaneous and symmetric with the lower pole reflux.  

Also, note that the axis of the right kidney, extablished by a line from the lowest calyx to the highest calyx will eventually cross the midline superiorly.  A similar line applied to the lower pole moiety on the left fails to cross the midline superiorly.  With a complete duplication, in the absence of upper pole reflux, this abnormal axis is commonly the only clue to the presence of reflux into the lower pole of a duplex kidney.
