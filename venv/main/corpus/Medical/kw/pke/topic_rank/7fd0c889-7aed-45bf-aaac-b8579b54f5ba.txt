Cholecystectomy and recovery of the common bile duct calculus with routine postoperative management.
Gray scale sonographic images of the gallbladder demonstrate multiple mobile subcentimeter foci of increased echogenicity within the gallbladder lumen that cast posterior acoustic shadows.  There is no gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid.  The common bile duct is not dilated, however, contains a single echogenic focus.
Choledocholithiasis and cholelithiasis
Choledocholithiasis (and)
Cholelithiasis (mobile and cast shadows) 
Gallbladder polyps (nonmobile and do not cast shadows)

Filling defects in the common bile duct:
stone / debris
hematoma
parasites
tumor - cholangiocarcinoma / adenoma
