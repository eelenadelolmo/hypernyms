32 year old male with fall onto outstretched hand.
Albeit rare, the pisiform fracture can be easily missed unless there is a high index of suspicion.  Additional views such as the reverse oblique view of the wrist (described by Alinok) or a carpal tunnel view as in this case is useful.  If plain films are equivocal, an MRI can be performed for confirmation.
