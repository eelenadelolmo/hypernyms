Abnormal skull morphology, with nonvisualization of the metopic suture.  There is abnormal sclerosis and narrowing of the anterior most aspect of the sagittal suture. There is thickening and prominence of the inferior frontal bones.  Hypotelorism with abnormal superomedial peaking of the orbits is noted.

Radiographically, hypotelorism can be determined by a intercanthal distance less than 15 mm in infants less than one year old (Benson et al. AJR 1996; 166(3):697-703).
Trigonocephaly, Metopic synostosis
4 week old baby boy with an unusually shaped head.
Radiographically, hypotelorism can be determined by a intercanthal distance less than 15 mm in infants less than one year old (Benson et al. AJR 1996; 166(3):697-703).
