CXR FINDINGS:
Airspace disease with possible cavitation in the lingula and left lower lobe along with partially loculated left effusion.  The mostlikely etiology is infection, however, other etiologies would include hemorrhage.  Recommend further evaluation with chest CT. 

Chest CT Findings: 
1.  Large, multiloculated pleural fluid collection in the left hemithorax as  described.  Slightly more complex regions are present inferiorly.   
2.  Streaky air space opacities in the lingula and left lower lobe which may represent superimposed or resolving infection with atelectasis.   
3.  Mediastinal and left hilar lymphadenopathy which is most likely reactive.This constellation of findings is most likely secondary to bacterial pneumonia.  Although less likely other considerations would include mycobacterial infection such as TB.

45 yo Female ED nurse at large inner city hospital diagnosed and treated 19 days with Levaquin for pneumonia.
Despite antibiotic therapy had persistence of symptoms and presented again to outside hospital with fevers to 103, productive cough, SOB, rigors and pleurisy. CXR at outside hospital showed worsened findings when compared to earlier CXR and transferred to larger hospital for treatment.
3 stages of empyema formation on radiographic studies. 

Stage 1: Exudative pleural effusion with more than 15,000 WBC/microliter. Easily drained

Stage 2: Fibrinopurulent stage with formed adhesions. Decortication may be necessary for treatment

Stage 3: Organizing stage with development of thick pleural peel. Decortication necessary for treatment. 

Split pleural Sign: seen in fibrinopurulent and organizing stages.  Requires contrast CT to enhance pleural linings to show separation of the two pleura by the empyema.
