Mild tenderness to palpation in the epigastrium.
The patient underwent a technically successful cholecystectomy.
The sonologist reports not being able to find the gallbladder.  The radiologist scans the patient and obtains the following image:

The gallbladder is filled with multiple stones and is not visualized in its entirety.  Instead, this transverse sonographic image through the right upper quadrant shows the anterior gallbladder wall along with an adjacent superficial layer of calculi; this is the classic appearance of the wall-echo shadow sign.
The Wall-Echo Shadow (WES) Sign
Cholelithiasis, as evidenced here by the wall-echo shadow sign.  This could easily be mistaken by the inexperienced sonographer for gas within a small bowel loop (and "absence of" or "nonvisualization of" the gallbladder).
This patient presents with a three week history of epigastric pain and states that, two years ago, she had been diagnosed with gallstones and had been scheduled to undergo surgery, which was postponed for unknown reasons.
Please refer to the accompanying factoid.
