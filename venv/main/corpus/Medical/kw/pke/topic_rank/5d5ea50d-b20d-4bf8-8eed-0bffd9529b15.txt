Femoral Artery Pseudoaneurysm
Pseudoaneurysm
Contained rupture of the femoral artery
58 year old female who resented approximately 3 weeks ago with chest pain.  She had a right femoral artery catheterization which showed no significant blockage.  She represented to the ER approximately 4 days later with worsening right groin pain.  US for DVT was unsuccessful due to patient apin.  Blood cultures were taken.  The patient presented again for worsening pain and a CT of the abdomen/pelvis was obtained.
Pseudoaneurysms can be thrombosed with intrarterial injection of thrombin or treated by inserting a graft at the location of the bleeding.  However, due to the infection at the operative site these were not options.
