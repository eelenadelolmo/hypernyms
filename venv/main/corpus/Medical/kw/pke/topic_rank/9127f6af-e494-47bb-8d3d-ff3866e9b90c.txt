N/C
Ultrasound of the pelvis demonstrates a large right adnexal mass with predominantly hyperechoic echotexture.  

MRI demonstrates a right ovarian cystic mass with predominantly expected homogeneously high T2 signal, with a rind of high T1/T2 signal in the anterior surface which becomes dark on fat-saturation images.  This clearly demonstrates the fatty component of what is most likely a benign cystic teratoma.
