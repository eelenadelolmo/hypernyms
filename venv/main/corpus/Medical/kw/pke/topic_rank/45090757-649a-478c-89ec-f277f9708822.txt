MRI of the brain – sagittal T1W, axial T2, FLAIR, coronal T2 with pre- and post-contrast T1W axial.

Vague low signal abnormality at the left insular region and left centrum semiovale.  There is a distinctly low signal rim surrounding a small central “popcorn-like” focus of higher signal on T2W images at the insular lesion.  Radially arranged small enhancing medullary veins drain into an enlarged transcortical vein.   The lesion in the white matter fibers is completely high T2W signal without similar venous structures surrounding it.  No mass effect, adjacent edema or gliotic changes are present.
Venous Angioma
New patient to the Neurosurgery Clinic, follow-up of a known brain abnormality.  No prior imaging is available
The findings above describe a venous angioma and the possibility of a small co-existent cavernous angioma.

The low signal rim surrounding the lesion at the insula represents small hemorrhage from the venous angioma or the presence of a small cavernous angioma.  These lesions are often larger, with surrounding gliotic changes.  It does demonstrate the characteristic popcorn like central focus of increased signal and it is the most common lesions seen in association with venous angioma.
