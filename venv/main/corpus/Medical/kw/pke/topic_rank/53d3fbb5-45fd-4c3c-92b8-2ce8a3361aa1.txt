The plain film of the abdomen shows an elliptical ring-like calcification in the RUQ which corresponds to the shape and location of the gallbladder, the characteristic appearance of porcelain gallbladder.  The ultrasound (Film .2) reveals a crescentic hyperechoic areas (anterior gallbladder with wall).  The CT scan (Film .3) shows curvilinear calcification conforming to the gallbladder wall.
Porcelain gallbladder.
An 86-year-old woman with a complaint of chronic abdominal pain underwent radiologic evaluation.  Review the abdominal film (Film .1).  What is the diagnosis?  Now evaluate the US (Film .2) and the CT scan (Film .3).
Porcelain gallbladder is a term used to describe extensive calcification of the gallbladder wall which gives blue discoloration and brittle consistency to the gallbladder wall, hence the term "porcelain."  The calcification is thought to be a result of low grade chronic inflammation, supported by the fact that gallstones are almost always present and frequently obstruct the cystic duct.  The gallbladder wall is thickened by chronic inflammation and the mucosa is often denuded.  Pathologically, the calcification occurs as a broad continuous band in the muscularis or as multiple, punctate deposits in the glandular spaces of the mucosa.

The condition is 5 times more frequent in females.  A paucity of symptoms is characteristic, and the diagnosis is often made on the incidental finding on plain abdominal films.  Because an associated increased frequency of gallbladder carcinoma, prophylactic cholecystectomy is generally performed even in the asymptomatic patient.

The plain film findings are characteristic, the gallbladder outlined by a ring of calcification.  The thickness of the calcification varies, and the distribution may be uneven or discontinuous.  The major differential diagnosis is a large solitary peripherally calcified gallstone.  An OCG usually does not visualize.

On ultrasound, the appearance of gallbladder wall calcification is a hyperechoic semilunar area with a posterior acoustic shadow and non-visualization on the lumen.  A contracted gallbladder filled with stones may mimic this ultrasonic appearance.

CT readily demonstrates the mural calcification, and, in addition, may visualize the presence of associated carcinoma and its extension.
