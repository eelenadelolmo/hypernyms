Hands: Swelling of proximal interphalangeal joints of both hands without tenderness, warmth, or erythema
Skin:    plaque-like thickening and areas of hyper and hypopigmentation of the skin of upper arms, upper back, neck and scalp.
Bone involvement is difficult to treat separate from overall disease.  Vitamin D and calcium supplementation may increase already elevated risk of hypercalcemia in sarcoid patients.  Systemic treatment for sarcoidosis (corticosteroids, methotrexate, etc.) may slow or even reverse bone damage.  Serial radiography of involved bones may be used to evaluate overall rogression of disease and provides non-invasive modality to assess efficacy of therapeutic interventions.

The patient has a questionable history of lung involvement as demonstrated by nonspecific spirometry changes with normal chest radiography, which is confused by his history of chronic bronchitis.
