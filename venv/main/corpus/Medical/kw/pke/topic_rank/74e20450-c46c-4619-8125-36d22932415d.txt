Duplication of the SVC.
The patient was undergoing a temporary dialysis catheter placement in the left internal jugular vein.  During the procedure the guidewire initially descended to the left of the spine and there was concern for an arterial stick.  An angiogram was performed, which confirmed venous location and the presence of a duplicated SVC.
