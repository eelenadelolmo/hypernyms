Radiographically it is a broad-based, juxtacortical, densely ossified mass, the periphery somewhat less dense that the base. CT scan is most useful and can demonstrate a radiolucent zone of periosteum and fibrous tissue trapped between the tumor and cortex. The lesion may consist of three layers: at the cortical surface it is dense and compact, it has a middle layer of amorphous dense bone, and the outer layer there are dense spicules extending into the periphery. These tumors typically have a low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and a high signal intensity on T2-weighted images.  The lesion may eventually progress to cortical destruction and medullary invasion, MRI can be used to grade the extent of tumor extension and cortical disruption.
