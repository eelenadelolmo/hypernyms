Longitudinal ultrasound of the gravid uterus reveal two fetal poles.  Visualization of a membrane separating the twins confirms diamniotic twins.  Additionally, there is a “twin peak sign”, a triangular extension of placental tissue with the apex pointing into the intertwin membrane, confirming dichorionicity.
