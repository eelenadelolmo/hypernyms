Mucous Retention Cyst
39 y.o. woman presents for routine CT screening.
Previously treated for papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Currently asymptomatic.
Mucous retention cysts are most common in the maxillary antrum.  They are very common in asymptomatic patients, and have been observed to appear and resolve without treatment.  When they become symptomatic, the options should be discussed with the patient - including "watchful waiting" while under therapy for co-existent sinusitis, etc.
