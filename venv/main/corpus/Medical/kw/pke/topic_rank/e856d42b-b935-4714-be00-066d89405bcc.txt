Left arm edema and palpable thrill over the AV fistula.
The patient was seen in follow-up with a patent right fistula and thrombosed left arm fistula. Arm swelling was improved.
Preoperative fistulogram showed brisk flow through the hemodialysis fistula.

Following coil placement, fistulogram showed more sluggish flow through the fistula. It is not unusual for an embolized vessel to have persistent flow initially, as the coils may not caused thromosis immediately.
Coil emboliztion of a dialysis fistula
1. Unsuccessful ligation of the dialysis fistula - proven with fistulogram.
The patient is a 71 year old female who originally had radial-cephalic hemodialysis fistula created in the left upper arm, ipsilateral to a cardiac pacemaker. The pacemaker caused a central venous stenosis, which, in conjunction with arterialized flow through the fistula, caused massive left arm swelling. The patient had placement of a right forearm fistula, and at the same setting had surgical ligation of the problematic left arm fistula. On follow-up visit, She had persistent left arm swelling and a palpable thrill in the ligated left arm fistula. She was referred for coil embolization of the fistula in an effort to spare her another operation.
It is unusual to embolize an AV dialysis fistula. Typically, the interventional radiologist will be asked to keep the fistula patent. However, in this case there was a central stenosis that could not be angioplastied for fear of dislodging the pacer leads (It is unlikely that this would have been a durable solution regardless).  

Complications of embolization include non-target embolization. In this case, this would include embolization of the radial artery or embolization to the pulmonary artery.
