Neurosurgical consultation; the aneurysm was subsequently coiled by neurointerventional radiology.
Head CT reveals near 2cm hyperdense mass adjacent to right MCA.  On follow-up MRI, the mass has dramatic pulsation artifact, has crescentic internal T2 hypointensity, and does fill with contrast on enhanced T1W images.  Subsequent angiogram demonstrates an enhancing saccular right MCA aneurysm
