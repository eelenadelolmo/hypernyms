29 year old male from Ghana with 2 month history of abdominal pain, not well localized.
This is a case of chronic infection with schisotosomiasis. Eggs released by the adult collect in the epithelial tissues of the portal vein and pre-sinusoidal capillaries. The eggs illicit a profound immunologic response that eventually leads to fibrosis. Over an extended period of time this fibrosis leads to portal hypertension and can involve the spleen and lungs. The parenchyma of the liver remains essentially untouched. 

In this patient the non-cirrhotic portal hypertension also lead to esophageal and rectal varices.
