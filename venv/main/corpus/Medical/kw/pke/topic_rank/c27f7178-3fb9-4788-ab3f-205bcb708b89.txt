Axial contrast enhanced CT images reveal a large, heterogeneously enhancing anterior mediastinal mass, measuring 6.9cm AP by 7.4cm transverse.  No calcification or macroscopic fat is present, though central hypodensity consistent with necrosis or cystic degeneration is seen medially.  An enlarged lymph node is contiguous with the aortic arch superiorly, with loss of the fat plane separating the mass from the anterior chest wall seen more inferiorly.

41 yo woman presents with hemoptysis and pruritus, with a “chest mass” seen on an outside chest radiograph.
Per the Cleveland clinic online (http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/diseasemanagement
/dermatology/pruritus/pruritus.htm):

The strongest association of pruritus and malignancy is with Hodgkin's disease. Itching may precede Hodgkin's disease, and the intensity correlates with the severity of the disease. Itching is present more on the legs and the lower half of the body, is described as burning in quality, and is usually more intense at night. Generalized pruritus has also been described in patients with leukemia, but is less intense than in Hodgkin's disease. The association between solid visceral tumors and pruritus is less clear, though pruritus has been reported in patients with cancers of the lung, colon, breast, uterus and prostate. The pruritus frequently remits when the malignancy is treated and reappears with relapse of the disease.
