The patient was treated surgically with arthroscopic partial lateral meniscectomy. There were no complications. The patient was seen 10 days post-op and was doing well. He completed physical therapy for strengthening and range of motion exercises.
Plain radiograph right knee: Fluid or soft tissue density fills the suprapatellar bursa. Minimal osteopenia is present without significant joint space narrowing. No other radiographic evidence of juvenile idiopathic arthritis is seen

MRI right knee: There is prominent fluid in the supra patellar bursa.  A small amount of fluid is present within the knee joint.  The lateral meniscus appears to be discoid. The medial meniscus is unremarkable.
Discoid Meniscus
- Discoid meniscus
- Meniscal Tear
- Juvenile Rhuematoid Arthritis
- Plica
- Patellofemoral Syndrome
- Chondromalacia patellae
- Osteochrondral defect
11 y.o. boy presents with pain, mechanical symptoms and flexion contracture of the right knee. He denies any injury to the knee. He was seen 4 years ago for right knee pain and swelling. X-ray and MRI at that time showed synovitis and the patient had mild leukopenia so he was referred to rheumatology and hematology but was lost to follow-up.  He returned to the office with the worsening symptoms.
18 months later the patient presented with similar symptoms of pain and mechanical symptoms in his left knee. He had a 20 degree flexion contracture. MRI revealed discoid meniscus of the left lateral meniscus and osteochrondral defect. Bilateral discoid meniscus as seen in this patient occurs in approximately 20% of cases.
