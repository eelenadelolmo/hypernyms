Teratoma
Germ Cell Tumor
28 year old with a 2 week history of right testicular swelling and pain.  Patient was treated for epididymitis prior to evaluation by urology after refractory pain and swelling.
Diffuse microcalcifications are associated with &#8220;germ cell malignancies, infertility, Klinefelter&#8217;syndrome, and cryptochordism&#8221; (Brant). Forty percent of males with testicular microlithiasis have associated germ cell neoplasm. These findings are typically bilateral. Sonographic images show diffuse but irregular punctate echodensities without shadowing (Brant).
