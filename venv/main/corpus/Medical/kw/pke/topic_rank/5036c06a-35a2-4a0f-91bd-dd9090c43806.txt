EGD shows esophageal stricture.
CXR demonstrates significant hilar adenopathy.
palliative care
Large subcarinal/mediastinal mass which completely occludes the esophagus in the area superior to the G-E junction.
poorly differentiated neoplasm as a second primary
Recurrence and extension of non-small cell CA
Hodgkin's lymphoma
Known non-small cell Ca of lung, now reports new onset dysphagia and odynophagia.
This pt was diagnosed a year prior to this CT with Non-small cell CA and treated accordingly with chemotherapy. Follow-up Chest CTs demonstrated resolving pulmonary nodules and progressive resolution was presumed. On the CT of DEC 04, this trend continued for the aforementioned nodules, but a large, sub-carinal mediastinal mass was found to occlude the distal esophagus, prompting the search for a second primary as source, most likely lymphoma. The path biopsies of this mass are still somewhat indeterminate, but "metastatic CA" of unsure etiology, as well as large cell lymphoma or melanoma are chief among the differential list.
