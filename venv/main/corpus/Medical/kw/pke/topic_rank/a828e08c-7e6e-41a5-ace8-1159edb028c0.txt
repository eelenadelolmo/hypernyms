The patient underwent surgical resection of hepatic segments 5 and 6 with pathology-confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma measuring 6cm.  No lymph-vascular invasion.  The surgical margins were negative for tumor.  Underlying liver changes consistent with chronic hepatitis.
Three phase intravenous contrast-enhanced CT of the liver demonstrates a subtle hypodense mass in segment 5.  Arterial phase images demonstrate contrast enhancement within the lesion with a serpentine appearance.  Delayed images demonstrate diffuse, heterogeneous enhancement of the mass.
