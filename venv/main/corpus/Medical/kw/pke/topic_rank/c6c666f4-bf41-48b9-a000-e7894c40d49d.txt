On exam, the patient had TTP very well localized to the LLQ with borderline peritoneal signs.  The patient was afebrile with only a mildly elevated WBC count.
On imaging, there is an ovoid, fat density structure (slightly greater than normal fat attenuation), adjacent to the sigmoid colon.  There is a hyperdense rim with some surrounding fat stranding.  There is a central focus of increased density.
