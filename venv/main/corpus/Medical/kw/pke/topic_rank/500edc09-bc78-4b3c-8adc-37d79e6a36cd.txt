Hiatal Hernia
Patient complains of chronic reflux symptoms that are especially worse when sleeping at night. Denies any associated dysphagia. She has tried PPIs in the past, but symptoms persist.
More than half of all patients with hiatal hernias are thought to have associated GERD. Therefore, these patients should have routine follow-up and repeat imaging/endoscopy to evaluate for any evidence of progressive esophagitis and/or dysplasia (Barrett's). Ensuring adequate follow-up is key to early detection of malignant transformation.
