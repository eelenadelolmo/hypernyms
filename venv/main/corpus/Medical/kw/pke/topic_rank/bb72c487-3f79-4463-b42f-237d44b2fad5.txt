The patient presented with drowsiness, weariness in upper and lower limbs and gait difficulties.
BP 180/110 mmHg
MRI findings of bilateral and symmetric basal ganglia involvement, but diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out (by laboratory and clinical and MRI evolution) of other possible causes. After recovering from the HELLP syndrome, pre-eclampsia and normalization of the high-blood pressure, the patient experienced a quick and complete recovery. Subsequent MRI 2 weeks later was completely normal.

Anti-hypertensive and supportive treatment with favorable evolution.
Lentiform Fork Sign in HELLP syndrome. Bilateral symmetric hypodensity of the basal ganglia on non-enhanced CT, without enhancement after contrast administration. Subsequent MRI showed hypointense areas on T1WI and high intensity on T2WI and FLAIR, consistent with vasogenic edema involving symmetrically globus pallidus, putamen, internal and external capsules, but tiny areas of diffusion restriction were present.

Follow-up MRI 2 weeks later showed complete resolution of the imaging findings.
Lentiform Fork Sign of Basal Ganglia in HELLP Syndrome.
Acute uremic encephalopathies, typically acute glomerulonephritis, hemolytic-uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Systemic metabolic acidosis.

Toxins such as methanol and carbon monoxide.

Etiologies of acute hypoxia.

Metabolic conditions as mitochondrial disorders could also be included in the differential.

Symmetric vasculitis-like processes related to tuberculosis and fungal basal meningitis could also involve bilaterally the basal ganglia.

Deep veins thrombosis.
24 y.o. woman with HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver, Low Platelets) and severe pre-eclampsia with high blood pressure (180/110 mmHg).
Lentiform Fork Sign was classically described in acute uremic encephalopathies and it was explained by both acute uremia and associated metabolic acidosis. Acute uremic encephalopathies in which this sign was typically described included acute glomerulonephritis, hemolytic-uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. 

Classical described MRI findings were relatively symmetric edema in the globus pallidus and putamen, with extension to the internal and external capsules, associated with some mass effect.

The differential diagnosis includes hypoxia and toxins as methanol and carbon monoxide. Metabolic conditions as mitochondrial disorders could also be included in the differential. Symmetric vasculitis-like processes related to tuberculosis and fungal basal meningitis could also involve bilateraly the basal ganglia.
