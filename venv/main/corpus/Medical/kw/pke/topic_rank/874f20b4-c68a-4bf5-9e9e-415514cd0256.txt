In the region of the right common femoral artery, color doppler images reveal a cystic structure adjacent to the common femoral artery with a swirling pattern of blood flow in the lumen appearing as a characteristic “yin-yang” sign.  

Spectral Doppler flow demonstrates a narrow neck in relation to the large lumen, with to-and-fro (bidirectional) flow.
