Tender to palpation in right upper quadrant. Rigors.
15.4 WBC count. Elevated LFTs.
IV antibiotics
Surgical drain placement
Right dome of liver, septated and heterogeneously hypodense lesion but without notable internal enhancement with IV contrast, and no calcifications. (There is a rim of hypoattenuating / decreased enhanced liver parenchyma around the margin.  Moderate intra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There is also a small right pleural effusion and atelectasis at the lung base)
Pyogenic liver abscess
Other liver cyst with hemorrhagic component
Fungal or amoebic abscess
Cystic primary neoplasm/metastasis
Febrile illness with spiking fevers and leukocytosis for 4 days, nausea and emesis for 14 hours.
Patient had an enlarged appendix without other signs of appendicitis. He also had some mild enhancement of the gallbladder wall without cholelithiasis, and a prior US report suggesting scant peri-cholecystic fluid (not seen on CT). This highlights the most common bacterial sources of such a hepatic process: from a biliary source, or from the GI tract via the portal vein. In this patient, both sources were considered as possible and presented a quandary as such.
