Grenade fragment to right transverse foramina of the vertebrae
22 y.o. otherwise healthy marine from Fallujah, Iraq during major firefight. Grenade went off in confined area.
It would be wise to flag the medical record of this marine with precaution to MRI; given the location in the transverse foramina. Since there was no evidence of damage to the vertebral artery, there was no need for an angiogram.
