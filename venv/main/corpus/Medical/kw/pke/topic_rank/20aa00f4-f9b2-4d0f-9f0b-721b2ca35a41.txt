After imaging the patient was to meet with the orthopedic surgeons to discuss the diagnosis and treatment options.

Treatment options range from non-operative to total wrist arthroplasty, depending on the severity of symptoms.  DISI should be corrected.  

If symptoms are mild and there is at least 80% grip strength in the uninvolved wrist is present then conservative therapy is reasonable.  This may include NSAID's and steroid injection.

SLAC reconstruction (limited wrist fusion) is performed by resecting the schaphoid and performing arthrodesis of the lunate, capitate, triquetrum, and hamate.  During this procedure the terminal branch of the interosseous nerve may be resected for pain relief.
This procedure is not effective in patients with radiolunate involvement.

DISI is corrected by using fiver Kirschner wires and bone grafts for stability. 

If involvement is limited to the radioschaphoid joint space, a proximal row resection is the option. The benefit of this procedure is that it is associated with the best range of motion.  The drawback is that is could lead to new pain secondary to radiocapitate joint space narrowing.

Total wrist arthrodesis reduces pain however; it can severely limit range of motion.  Total wrist arthroplasty is an option for patients with bilateral disease.  The drawback to arthroplasty is that the implants are associated with a high incidence of complications.  

Scapholunate Advanced Collapse, Danikas, Dimitrios, MD, http://www.emedicine.com/orthoped/topic553.htm#section
PA, lateral and oblique views of the wrist demonstrate the classic appearance of schapholunate advanced collapse with dorsal intercalated segment instability.  (See captions for specific descriptions)
Scapholunate Dissociation
See discussion.
47 year old female with several weeks history of pain in the wrist.
Dorsal intercalated segment instability is defined as dorsal tilt of the lunate which is often associated with volar tilt of the scaphoid.  Normal scapholunate angle is 30 to 60 degrees.  Capitolunate angle normal measurment is 0 to 30 degrees.  If the scapholunate angle measures more than 60 degrees or the capitolunate angle measures less than 30 degress, DISI is present.
