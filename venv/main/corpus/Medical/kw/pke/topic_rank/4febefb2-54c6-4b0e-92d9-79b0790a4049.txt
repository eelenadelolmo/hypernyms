• Multiple reentrant depolarization waves colliding in atria
• Results in variable conduction to ventricle
• Decremental conduction through AV node
• Ventricular rate may be slow or fast
• No effective contraction, so clots can form in atrium
• Common cause of “stroke” by embolization or low cardiac output
