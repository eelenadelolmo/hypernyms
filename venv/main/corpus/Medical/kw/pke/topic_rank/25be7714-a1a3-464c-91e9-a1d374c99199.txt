A rigid flatfoot is noted with the calcaneus in fixed equinus and the Achilles tendon is very tight.
The current treat involves percutaneous K-wire pinning of the talonavicular joint and percutaneous heel-cord tenotomy. Casting without pinning of the talonavicular joint can result in recurrence of deformity.
1) Talus is in extreme plantarflexion, assuming a vertical orientation. 
2) Calcaneus is in equinus.
3) Navicular is relatively dorsally dislocated.
4) Metatarsals are dorsiflexed.

As a result of these anatomic changes, the plantar arch is made convex.
ROCKER-BOTTOM DEFORMITY (Congenital vertical talus)
1) Congenital vertical talus(aka rocker-bottom foot deformity)
2) Calcaneovalgus Deformity
3) Uncorrected Clubfoot
4) Cerebral palsy
9 month old presents to Orthopedic Department for first time with malformation of the feet bilaterally.
