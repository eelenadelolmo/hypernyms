Texto: 
Within the right cingulate gyrus is visualized a focus of abnormal signal which, on coronal T2 FLAIR images demonstrates heterogeneous bright signal within, but a dark rim.  On pre-contrast T1 weighted images, the lesion is heterogeneous, but predominantly isointense to the surrouding brain parenchyma, but demonstrates a hypointense rim.  Post contrast images demonstrate central enhancement.
