Asymptomatic.
None indicated
Increased radiotracer uptake within right proximal tibia. CT images show a fat attenuation lesion with internal dystrophic calcification and ossification.  There is no peripheral rim of ossification.
Ossifying Intraosseous Lipoma.
Intraosseous Lipoma with internal dystrophic calcification and ossification.
Bone scan for an unrelated complaint.
The bone scan is too hot for a longstanding bone infarct, and there is no peripheral rim of ossification on the CT.  The internal structure indicates a vascularized lesion with fat and dystrophic calcification and ossification.
