Sonographic image of the spleen demonstrates multiple well-defined, hyperechoic lesions within the splenic parenchyma with a similar appearance to hepatic hemangiomas.
Splenic Hemangioma
Hemangioma, hamartoma, angiosarcoma, lymphoma, metastatic disease, malignant histiocytoma, infection, post-traumatic hematomas, lymphangiomas
36 yo female with persistant, intermittent left shoulder pain (no 
injury) x 4 weeks. Pain is often severe. There is a clinical question of referred pain. The patient also has a history of splenic pathology on past imaging studies. Please evaluate spleen and gallbladder.
Hemangiomas are benign vascular neoplasms with slow internal flow.   They are the most common benign neoplasms of the spleen, are almost always asymptomatic and, as in this case, are found incidentally on imaging.    Hemangiomas have been reported in up to 14% of autopsy specimens.  They are usually a solitary solid mass; although, they can be diffuse and rarely can cause splenomegaly.  This entity has also been described in the Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome.  They do not usually calcify.  Hamartomas, also benign splenic lesions but less common, may demonstrate some calcification.  Distinguishing between these two benign entities is often difficult.
