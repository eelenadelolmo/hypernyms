Patient had an immediate post-op MR to confirm resolution of the mass effect.  These tumors are less aggressive and have a good surgical cure rate but recurrence is possible so he will need survellience MR imaging.
CT- Within the posterior right frontal-parietal region there is a large heterogeneous cystic mass measuring ~7.0 X 5.0 cm.  There is a 3.0 X 2.0 cm isodense mural nodule that is abutting the peripheral leptomeninges, and shows diffuse enhancement.  There is a 5mm focus of calcification within the mural nodule.  There is associated mass effect and 1.2 cm of right to left midline shift. 

MR- There is a large heterogeneous cystic mass in the right posterior frontal-parietal region.  There is a heterogeneous mural nodule that abuts the peripheral leptomeninges, and demonstrates avid enhancement after Gadolinium-DTPA administration.  Again identified is the significant mass effect and associated midline shift to the left.
