No focal findings
CT and MRI demonstrate an extra-axial, well circumscribed, avidly enhancing para-sagittal lesion at the vertex which causes downward mass effect on the corpus callosum.  Central T1 hypointensity likely represents necrosis; blood would be less likely.
Meningioma
• Meningioma
• Hemangiopericytoma
• Prostate mets (not applicable in this young patient)
22 year old man presents with new onset seizures and frequent headaches
Gross calcifications seen on CT help differentiate this lesion from a hemangiopericytoma.
