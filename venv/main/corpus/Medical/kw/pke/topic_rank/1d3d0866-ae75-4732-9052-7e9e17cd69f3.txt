Diffuse swelling around the right knee, diffuse tenderness to palpation. Inability to voluntarily extend knee. Labs non-contributory.
surgical re-attachment
There is complete disruption of the quadriceps tendon immediately proximal to the patellar insertion.  There is extensive edema surrounding the quadriceps
tendon, both superficial and deep to the tendon.  There is oval fluid collection anterior to the patella consistent with prepatellar bursal fluid
collection.  A moderate sized joint effusion is present.  There is injury to the medial retinaculum with partial thickness tearing of the medial retinaculum.  Also noted is a stripping of the vastus medialis obliquus away from the medial aspect of the femur with complete disruption of the medial
patellofemoral ligament.  The adductor magnus tendon appears intact and inserts normally into the adductor tubercle.  Extensive soft tissue edema is also noted adjacent to the lateral retinaculum with partial thickness tearing of the superior fibers of the lateral retinaculum.

Fell with flexed knee on ice
The longer surgery is delayed the more retracted the quadriceps muscle/tendon will be, making the re-attachment much more difficult.
