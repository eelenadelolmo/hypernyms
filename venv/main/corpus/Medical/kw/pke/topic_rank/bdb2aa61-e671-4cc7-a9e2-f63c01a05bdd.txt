Ultrasonographic imaging failed to demonstrate a gestational sac in the uterus.  In the right adnexa, there is a round anechoic structure surrounded by a rim of echogenic material which demonstrates prominent vascularity.  There is an echogenic ring structure seen within the anechoic "sac".  This second ring structure represents the yolk sac.  There is no fetal pole or heartbeat identified.  There is fluid in the cul-de-sac, with a few low-level echoes, representing hemorrhage.
