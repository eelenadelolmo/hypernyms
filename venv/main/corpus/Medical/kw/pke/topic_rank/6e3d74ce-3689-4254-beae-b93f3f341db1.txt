Texto: 
Large cutaneous hairy nevi demonstrated on bilateral chest walls.

CSF Cytology:  Atypical cells with melanini pigment consistent with malignant melanoma.
Patient is undergoing chemotherapy with Temozolamide and CNS radiation therapy.
MR of the the spine demonstrates a linear focus of abnormal T2 signal in the intrathecal space from T7 to T8 with adjacent thickening of the dura superior and inferiorly.  

MR of the brain demonstrates leptomeningeal enhancement with no focal parenchymal enhancement.  Nonenhancing lesions that are hyperintense on T1WI in the bilateral temporal lobes.  

FDG PET imaging demonstrated low grade activity in the thorac spinal cord with a standard uptake value (SUV) of 2.0.
Neurocutaneous Melanosis
Neurocutaneous melanosis
Malignant Melanoma
14 year old with new onset diabetes with transient peripheral seventh and sixth nerve palsies.
The radiographic findings in this adolescent patient have been described in case reports as having increased signal in the temporal lobes, leptomeningeal enhancement and associated intraspinal lesion.  This is a rare condition that is typically fatal in early infancy from complications from mass effect.
