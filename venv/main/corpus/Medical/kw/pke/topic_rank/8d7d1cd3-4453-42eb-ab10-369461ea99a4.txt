Texto: 
Low TSH, high FT4, high ESR. Pain in the neck. Tenderness to palpation in the right upper pole of the thyroid. No thyroid nodules. Normal sized thyroid gland.
After injestion of 5.3 uCi of sodium I-131 for uptake values, 375 uCi of sodium I-123 was given and images of the thyroid were obtained.  The 24 hour uptake was 0.4% (normal 12-30%).  

The images demonstrate very poor target to background ration consistent with the poor iodine uptake within the gland.  Additionally, a focal deficit is present within the upper pole of the right lobe.
Subacute thyroiditis with focal involvement of the right upper pole.
Cold nodule
Focal subacute thyroiditis
Weakness and palpitations.
