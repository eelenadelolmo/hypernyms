65 year old German woman who has complained of a 5 year history of hemoptysis
There are several finer points to this case. 

First, the angiographer must take care to identify hazardous collaterals originating from the intercostal-bronchial trunk (ICBT), namely the anterior spinal artery. Filling the anterior spinal artery from ICBT injection is at least a relative contraindication to embolization. If the catheter cannot be positioned distal to the origin of the spinal artery, embolization should not be performed. 

Second, coils should not be used for embolization. The hemostasis required is at the capillary level. Placing a large, proximal coil will not treat the abnormal vessels, which will recruit proximal supply via other ICBT collaterals.
