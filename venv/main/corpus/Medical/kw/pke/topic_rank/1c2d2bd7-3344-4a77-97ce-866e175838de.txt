A curvilinear lucency is seen within the lumen of the aorta, extending down from the root of the last major cephalic branch.
Chronic aortic dissection
Patient is a 71 year old female with a history of ????????? 23 years earlier.  She was treated surgically at that time, including aortic valve resuspension.  Patient later developed severe aortic insufficiency requiring surgical repair.  CT was performed to rule out other abnormalities pre-operatively.
A chronic aortic dissection is seen which originates in the ascending aorta and descends into the descending aorta ending at the origin of the left renal artery (not visualized on the provided images).  The dissection flap is noted to involve the right innominate artery.  Incidentally noted is a "bovine aortic arch".
