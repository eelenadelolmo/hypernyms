Fenestration (or duplication) of proximal right vertebral artery to the C3 level.

Absent signal in left vertebral artery.
Vertebral Artery Fenestration
• Fenestration of right vertebral artery
• Duplication of right vertebral artery
47 year old woman presents with signs of cerebral ischemia.
Since the MRA examination did not include the right vertebral artery origin(s) it is not possible to determine if this is a duplication or fenestration.  Fenestration is a more common variant.
