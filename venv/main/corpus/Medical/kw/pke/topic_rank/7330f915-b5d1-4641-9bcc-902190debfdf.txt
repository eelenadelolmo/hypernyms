The patient's head shape is abnormally narrow transversely and elongated longitudinally.
Treatment can be conservative, wearing a "cranial helmet" (causing reshaping of the skull), or undergo surgery dependent on the severity of the condition.
An axial CT image of the superior portion of the skull and volume rendered CT images of the skull demonstrate closure of the metopic and sagittal sutures.
