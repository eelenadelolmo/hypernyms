Sagittal proton density  images of the knee with and without fat suppression demonstrate screw tunnels in the distal femur and proximal tibia indicative of prior ACL grafting.  The tibial screw tunnel lies anterior to a line drawn along the intercondylar roof (Bloomensaat’s line).  The ACL graft appears draped over the distal portion of the intercondylar roof.  There is increased signal intensity within the distal portion of the graft.
