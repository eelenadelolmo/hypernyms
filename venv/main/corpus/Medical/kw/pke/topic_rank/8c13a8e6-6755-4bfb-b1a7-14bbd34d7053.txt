Colloid cyst was resected given pt's acute presentation.
Noncontrast CT of the head demonstrates a well-circumscribed hyperdense mass in the anterior portion of third ventricle in the region of foramen of Monroe. There is asymmetric enlargement of the right ventricle suggestive of hydrocephalus.

MR images demonstrate a well-circumscribed mass in the anterior portion of the third ventricle at the foramen of Monroe that is hyperintense on T1, mildly hyperintense on T2 and demonstrates some peripheral rim enhancement on post contrast images.
Colloid cyst of the third ventricle
Colloid Cyst
Central Neurocytoma
Gliomas (subependymal giant cell tumor in Tuberous Sclerosis, pilocytic astrocytoma, oligodendrogliomas)
Craniopharyngioma
Choroid Plexus Papilloma
Vascular Tumors
Cysticercosis
27yo white man presents to the emergency room with acute onset of headache.
Likely colloid cyst given the signal characteristics of hyperdense on CT, hyperintense on T1, slightly hyperintense on T2 and rim enhancement.  Rim enhancement is seen in 40% of cases.  Dense enhancement would suggest a lesion other than colloid cyst.

Central Neurocytoma - Intraventricular, benign, slow growing hypervascular tumors, commonly in the lateral ventricle,usually attached to septum pellucidum at FM and mimic oligodendroglioma on histology. Predilection for young females. Hyperdense on CT, isointense to gray matter on T1WI, 50% calcify and enhances brightly but inhomogeneously. 

Craniopharyngioma - 2nd most common mass in third ventricle,most are suprasellar, usually in 5-10 or >50 yr old patients, solid and cystic lesions containing cholestrol crystals. CT -> large cystic mass, enhancing rim and some calcification. MR-> Classically, cystic portion is hyperintense on T1 and T2. Most have calcification or enhancing rim.

Choroid Plexus Papilloma - rare neuroepithelial tumor most common in first decade, commonly seen in atrium of lateral ventricle in children and 4th ventricle in adults. III ventricle next common site. Highly vascular tumors. 10-20% show malignant degeneration. CT->iso-hyperdense, shape of cauliflower with choroid plexus calcification.  MR-> isointense to gray matter on T1, hyperintense on T2 and enhance markedly.
