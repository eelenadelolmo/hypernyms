Height:  5’3’’
Weight: 215 lbs
BP at rest: 128/70
Posture: Left antalgia
ROM: (via dual inclinometry) Lumbar spine flexion 29/60o with report of lower back and right lower extremity pain. Left lateral bending 25/25o. Right lateral bending 10/25o with report of right lower back and right lower extremity pain. Extension 3/25o with report of lower back and right lower extremity pain. 
Reflex: Subpatellar reflexes 2+ bilaterally. Achilles tendon reflex absent on right side. 
Gait: Toe walk normal. Unable to heel walk. 
Strength: Flexor and extensor halluces 5/5. 
Straight leg raise: Left straight leg raise elicited lower back and right lower extremity tingling (at 42o). Right straight leg raise elicited lower back pain and right lower extremity pain extending to foot (at 29o). 
Percussion and posterior to anterior compression of spine elicited pain over the lumbosacral region.  Hypomobility noted at thoracic and lumbosacral regions. Same areas also associated with pain/tenderness, asymmetry/misalignment, abnormal ROM, and tissue/tone changes.  Paraspinal muscle spasm noted over thoracic and lumbosacral regions.

- Electromyography: Chronic Right S1 Radiculopathy (large amplitude, long duration motor units with polyphasic morphology observed in in right peroneus longus and right gastrocnemius medius muscles on monopolar needle examination. Absent tibial H-reflex). 
- Nerve Conduction Study: Normal motor nerve conduction studies of the tibial and peroneal nerves rule out the probability of a focal mononeuropathy. Also, superficial peroneal and sural sensory responses were normal.
The patient presented in acute pain and antalgia.  She received flexion-distraction therapy as well as ultrasound therapy to the right lower lumbar region.  She also performed resistive lumbar extension and core strengthening exercises.  She has progressed nicely under care received and now moves about easily without antalgia.  No surgical intervention is anticipated.
L5-S1: Central disc herniation of the extrusion type measuring approximately 6mm in AP dimension which markedly impinges upon the anterior surface of the thecal sac. Slight asymmetry to the right is noted. A mild to moderate degree of central canal stenosis is noted. No significant foraminal stenosis is evident.  Apparent lumbarization of what is thought to be the S1 vertebra.

Work related injury. Patient says that she experienced some lower back pain and discomfort immediately after the injury, but did not seek any medical care hoping that it would go away. One month later, she experienced lower back and right lower extremity pain (extending to the foot), while lifting 10-15 bags of laundry weighing 40-80 pounds each, at her job.  Patient reports that although she tried to continue working, pain worsened to the point where she had to stop working. 

Patient’s past medical history includes asthma and fractures of nose, right thumb, and right great toe. Past surgical history is significant for tonsillectomy at age of 17. Hay fever. Allergic to sulfa drugs.

- Analgesics and activity modifications are mainstay of treatment during the acute symptomatic period. Weight reduction should be encouraged in patients with high BMI.
- Short-term opioid use can be tried for severe pain that fails to respond to non-narcotic options. Opioids are most often prescribed for patients with radiculopathy and severe pain who have inadequate relief with non-narcotics. Concomitant use of opioids and muscle relaxants (antispasmodics like cyclobenzaprine) should be avoided because of additive sedating effects.
- Insufficient data on benefit of systemic glucocorticoids — One option is oral prednisone (60 to 80 mg daily) for five to seven days during the acute period if not responsive to more conservative management. Must weigh the benefits versus the risks, namely elevated blood pressure, psychosis, insomnia, gastritis, hyperglycemia, bone loss, and infections. Of note, concomitant use of steroid and NSAIDs will require GI prophylaxis for risk of bleed. 

- Discectomy – partial or complete removal of the affected disc – most commonly performed because of persistent symptoms or progressive neurological impairment. Main goals of surgery are to rid nerve roots of compression / inflammation. No strong evidence as of yet for the long-term benefit of discectomy. 
- Conventional Open Surgery does not guarantee success. Surgery does not improve symptoms if a compressive lesion has already led to nerve ischemia.
- Endoscopic Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery has shown encouraging results in patients with HIZs, and also in patients with such conditions as lumbar spondylosis, lumbar spondylolisthesis, lateral recess stenosis and axial Stenosis.

- In this case no surgical heroics were necessary as the patient responded well to chiropractic treatment.
