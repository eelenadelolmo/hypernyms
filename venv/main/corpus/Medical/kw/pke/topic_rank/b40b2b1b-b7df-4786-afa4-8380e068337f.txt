Normal amniotic fluid volume on ultrasound
Chromosomal panel and AFP: pending
Close observation.  Amniotic fluid levels will likely be closely monitored.  Primary concern is nonimmune hydrops.  Doppler ultrasound can evaluate the vascularity of the mass to further evaluate risk of high output CHF.  Fetal surgery has been done in cases of hydrops, but is still largely experimental.  If fetus is delivered at term, surgical resection of teratoma is likely course.  Close follow-up even after surgical removal is necessary.
Large sacral mass with mixture of cystic and solid components with no apparent involvement of the spine.
Sacrococcygeal teratoma
• sacrococcygeal teratoma
• meningocele, myelomeningocele
• epidermoid or dermoid cyst
• rhabdomyosarcoma
The patient is a 20 year-old G1P0 woman with no significant past medical history noted to have an abnormality on routine ultrasound at 20 weeks gestational age.  The patient now presents for follow-up fetal MRI.
