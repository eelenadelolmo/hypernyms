No acute distress.  Abdomen distended and tender, incision clean and intact.  

Referring physician present and notably in more distress than patient.

Hemoglobin 9 after >10 units transfused.  BUN/Cr has doubled every 24 hours since surgery.

BP 110/60, afebrile, RR 25-30, O2 sats 98% on RA
The patient was taken to OR upon arrival to ICU with rapid diagnosis of condition.  Hematoma surgically evacuated and abdomen decompressed.  The patient survived and has a beautiful baby at home.
• Elevated left hemidiaphragm
• Heterogeneous fluid collection visualized around left side of liver, spleen, and diffusely through abdomen and pelvis
• Uterus not well contracted post-partum and intra-uterine contents include bubbles and heterogeneous fluid
• As aorta runs distally, it is shifted to the right side secondary to mass effect
• Flat IVC poorly identified on any slide
• Flattened renal veins 
• Left hydronephrosis
• Substantial dilation of bowels with air fluid levels
• Recent post-surgical changes noted on scout
Abdominal Compartment Syndrome
• Abdominal compartment syndrome
• Intravascular depletion secondary to massive hemorrhage
• Dehydration
• Ureteral obstruction
Pt is a 41 yo woman 3 days S/P C-section with known large intra-abdominal hemorrhage currently hemodynamically stable.  She is being transferred to the ICU secondary to severe acute renal failure in spite of normal blood pressure and adequate blood and volume resuscitation.
This case has excellent examples of a few of the key findings in ACS.  The reason for the transfer to the ICU is acute renal failure, so let's talk about the flattened renal veins first.  When they are too flat to let blood get back to the IVC, anuria and severe ARF begins.  We find that both the renal veins as well as the IVC are extremely compressed in virtually all images which should raise questions as to why.  In this case, it is a result of the severely increased intra-abdominal pressure, which makes sense as the amount of blood in the abdomen/pelvis rapidly accumulated and there is nowhere for the peritoneal cavity to release pressure.  The correlation between the large intra-abdominal hemorrhage and the flat veins could be hypotension/volume depletion but it could also be secondary to pressure effects and the clinician would like to know about both possibilities.  Given that the woman's blood pressure is normal in this example, elevated pressure in the abdomen jumps up on the differential.   Hydronephrosis though present, is really only left sided and wouldn't account for the severity of ARF in this patient.  

Like the compression of the veins, the elevated left hemidiaphragm is non-specific.  If caused by increased intra-abdominal pressure, this is observed in patients with pressures of 15 mmHg or greater, so intra-abdominal hypertension is suggested by this finding but it is seen in levels lower than those required for the diagnosis of ACS.

In this case, it is key not only to find the elephant sized significant findings but also recognize that there are 3 important signs of possible increased intra-abdominal pressure (none of which are specific, but the rest of the CT scan helps put ACS to the top of the differential for these findings).  Most impressively, renal vein and IVC flattening generally do not exist unless intra-abdominal pressures are high enough to cause ACS, and usually it requires pressures to exceed 30 mmHg (ACS is defined as >20 mmHg plus evidence of organ failure).  Therefore, the extreme flattening of these vessels, is worth mentioning in the report with ACS on the differential, especially since you're looking at the rest of this abdominal CT and there's clear reason for her to have ACS.
