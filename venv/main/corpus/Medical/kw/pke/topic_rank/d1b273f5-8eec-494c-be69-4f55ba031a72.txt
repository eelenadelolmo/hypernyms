Persistent Left SVC
Line placed into arterial system
Status post trauma with multiple medical problems, evaluate line placement.
Epidemiology: left superior vena cava approximately 0.3%. Double SVC most common 85%. Single left SVC rare and is associated with congenital heart disease. Failure of obliteration of left common cardinal vein.
The superior vena cava is normally formed by junction of short vertically oriented right and longer obliquely oriented left brachiocephalic veins at level of T1. The azygos vein enters SVC at midpoint. This vein contains no valves. The left SVC is usually < 2cm in diameter. Descends anteriorly and joins the coronary sinus.
