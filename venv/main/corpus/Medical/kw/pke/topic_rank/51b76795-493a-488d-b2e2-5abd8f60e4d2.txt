Palpation of the distal two thirds of the right fibula produces exquisite pain.  There is erythema of the overlying skin.  Afebrile.
Conservative management to include cessation of athletic activity for 1-2 months.  Use of an ankle support or walking cast can be considered.
Plain radiographs of the right fibula demonstrate smooth cortical thickening along the lateral aspect of the distal fibular diaphysis without obvious fracture lucency.  Blood pool and delayed images of a Tc-99m MDP bone scan demonstrate fusiform intense uptake parallel to the long axis of the distal right fibula.
Stress Fracture of the Distal Fibula
Stress fracture
Osteomyelitis
