Multiple trauma
This fracture is horizontal through the posterior/middle/anterior vertebrae with minimal displacement (no dislocation) other than the distraction of the posterior elements.  These features make this able to be managed non-operatively.  Patients are placed in a TLSO (Thoracolumbosacral orthosis) or hyperextension cast.
Patients will usually wear these for few months and then undergo an extensive rehab.
If unstable fracture or body habitus (precludes casting), surgical management is performed.
AP/LAT T-SPINE:  Anterior compression fracture of T11 with loss of approximately 50% of height.  AP view demonstrates abnormal pedicles with linear fractures and widening bilaterally.  Posterior elements not well seen on lateral secondary to spine board.
CT (Sag recon):  Horizontal fracture of T11 vertebral body extending horizontally throught posterior elements
MRI (Sag ): No cord compression or abnormal signal
Chance Fracture T11
The differential diagnosis initially after plain films alone include (compression, burst, chance and fracture dislocation).  The abnormal appearance of the pedicles with horizontal lucent fractures and widening rules-out compression fracture alone.  The involvement of the posterior elements and non-comminution of body fracture rules-out a burst fracture.  The fact that there are no associated dislocations rules-out fracture dislocation.

The mechanism of Chance fractures is flexion of the thorax on the abdoman, at their junction.  They are often associated with seat-belts and more than half the patients may have associated intra-abdominal injuries - especially in childhood.

CT (especially sagittal reconstruction) is especially useful to define the exent and type of fracture well.

MRI is useful in determining cord injury and impingement.

There  is a high incidence of associated intra-abdominal injury (liver and/or splenic laceration, bowel perforation) especially with lap belt etiology.  However, in this patient, these complications were not present.
