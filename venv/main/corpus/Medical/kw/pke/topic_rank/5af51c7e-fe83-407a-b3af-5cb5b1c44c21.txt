67 year old woman with swallowing deficiency s/p gastrostomy tube placement undergoing study to confirm g-tube position
According to history, this was obtained after Gastrografin injection into a gastrostomy tube.  A gastrostomy tube is in the gastric bed. However, the area opacified appears to be the "bubble" of the gastrostomy tube. This contrast is not in the gastric lumen. While on plain film it does appear that this gastrostomy tube is in the gastric lumen, that has not been confirmed on this single view study. The possibility is raised that the Gastrografin may have been inadvertently injected into the "air bubble" keeping the gastrostomy tube in place rather than in the main lumen of that catheter.
