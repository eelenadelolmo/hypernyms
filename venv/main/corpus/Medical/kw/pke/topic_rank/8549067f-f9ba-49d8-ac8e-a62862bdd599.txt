Unremarkable Clinical Exam per report.
Initial mammographic images were unremarkable. Initial ultrasound showed a small circumscribed hypoechoic lesion with hyperechoic center, thought to be a intramammary lymph node. Follow up imaging six months later demonstrated a circumscribed high denisty mass in the inferior right breast. Ultrasound at followup diagnostic mammogram showed a spiculated heterogenous predominantly hypoechoic mass with internal vascularity.
Poorly Differentiated Invasive Ductal Cell Carcinoma
Carcinoma.
Atypical fibroadenoma or any benign etiology very unlikely.
