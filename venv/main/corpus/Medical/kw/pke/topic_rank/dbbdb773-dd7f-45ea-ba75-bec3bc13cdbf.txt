In an older patient this may be due to endobronchial obstruction, recommend pulmonary consult.
Findings: hazy opacification of the left thorax with a lucency outlining the paraortic area on PA radiograph. The left hilum is slightly elevated. Lateral demonstrates left upper lobe collapse with anterior displacement of the left major fissure and retrosternal opacification.  Hyperexpanded left lower lobe with extension of the lower lobe to the apex.
Lung, lobar collapse (left upper lobe)
herniation of right lung across midline, medial pneumothorax

Luftsichel sign is the result of superior segment of left lower lobe hyperexpansion superiorly, in between the left upper lobe and abutting the aortic knob due to left upper lobe volume loss. The inferior and medial extents of the luftsichel are delineated by the left superior pulmonary vein.
