3mm pseudosubluxation of C2 over C3 with no other abnormality identified.
C2-3 Pseudosubluxation
Ligamentous injury resulting in true subluxation
5 year old male jumped off of roof. Complaining of neck and back pain, non focal.
Note that while the line drawn vertically down the anterior body of the vertebrae appears to step off at C2-3, the posterior vertebral bodies align (although there is flexion at this level) and the spinolaminar lines appropriately align.  This is what helps to exclude this Pseudosubluxation from actually C-spine pathology.
