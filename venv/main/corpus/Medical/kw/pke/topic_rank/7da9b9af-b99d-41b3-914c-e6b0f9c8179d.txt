ABD Tenderness to deep palpation elicited in periumbilical and LLQ.
Intussusception was successfully reduced by air contrast enema.
An inflammatory juvenile polyp, likely the lead point, was removed colonoscopically.
Plain radiograph: show distended loops of bowel in the region of ascending and transverse colon. No air is visible in left colon and rectum. 
Longitudinal ultrasound: shows submarine sandwich-like appearance of the intussuscipiens and the intussusceptum. 
Transverse ultrasound: shows a mass with a loop-within-a-loop. 
CT scan of the abdomen shows classic “target sign”
Air enema shows  intussusceptum in mid descending colon and lead point proximal to splenic flexture. 
Colonoscopy: identified a large juvenile polyp.
Colo-colic intussusception

Cecal/Sigmoid Volvulus
Small Bowel Obstruction

Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Two month history of dull, mild periumibilical pain with intermittent spells of severe sharp pain lasting 20 minutes. Three days of intermittent sharp pain and currant jelly stools. Vomiting x 24 hours, with five episodes of emesis, ultimately bilious.
Intussusception, a potentially lethal condition with poorly understood etiology, is the most common cause of acute intestinal obstruction in children younger then 5 years old. The classic triad of disease was described as the constellation of abdominal pain, abdominal mass and bloody stools. However, only about 3% of patients present with classic signs. Most patients typically develop sudden onset of intermittent, severe, crampy, progressive abdominal pain, accompanied by inconsolable crying and drawing up of the legs toward the abdomen. The episodes usually occur at 15 to 20 minute intervals. They become more frequent and more severe over time. Vomiting may follow episodes of the abdominal pain. 

The most commonly affected patient population are infants aged 6 months to 2 years. The incidence is associated with upper respiratory tract infection, which correlates with the highest frequency of disease occurring in fall and spring. The typical patient might not have inciting factors and most are healthy and well nourished infants. Males are 1.5 times more affected than females, and the prevalence is the highest among white infants. 

The condition is created when one part of intestines invaginatates on itself. This is called telescoping. The invaginated segment (intussusceptum) is carried distally by peristalsis. Mesentery and vessels become involved with the intraluminal loop and are squeezing the engulfing segment (intussuscipiens). Venous congestion is major factor both in sympthomatology and in the characteristic presence of blood in the stool (currant-jelly stools).  If not corrected, this can progress to intestinal edema, which can ultimately lead to ischemia, perforation and peritonitis. 

Before attempting reduction, the patient should be stabilized and resuscitated with intravenous fluids; the stomach should be decompressed with a nasogastric tube and the surgical team should be notified. Nonoperative reduction using air contrast techniques is successful in approximately 75 to 90 percent of patients. Success is more likely to be achieved in patients with idiopathic intussusception, although it alson can be accomplished in patients with a recognized lead point. In addition, success is less likely to be achieved in infants younger than one year of age, in children older than five years of age, when plain films show signs of intestinal obstruction and when symptoms have been present for longer than 48 hours. Recurrence after successful nonoperative reduction is approximately 10 percent. Surgery is indicated when nonoperative reduction is incomplete or when a persistent filling defect, indication a mass lesion, is noted.
