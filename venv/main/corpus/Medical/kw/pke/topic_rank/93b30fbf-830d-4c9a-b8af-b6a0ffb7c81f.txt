L-Spine Films #1-#2
      #1:  L2-L5 with increasing density.  Many osteophytes.  Surgical clips in pelvic inlet consistent with prostatectomy.  No fractures.  Bones aligned.  
     #2:  Lateral:  L2-L5 with increasing density. Osteophytes throughout.

C-Spine Films #3-PA, #4-lateral, #5-odontoid
C2 & C3 are sclerotic.  Anterior osteophytes at C3, C5 & C6.  C5 with decreased vertebral body height.  Disk spaces are maintained.  
#5 odontoid - has increased antlantoaxial joint space on right.
Metastatic Prostate Cancer (blastic)
Blastic bone metastasis:
breast
prostate
lymphoma
carcinoid
rarely PNET (medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, children)
69 yo man presents with lower back pain & neck pain.  He had a total prostatectomy two years earlier.  Post-op followup PSA  was 17; and, two months later, PSA has risen to 39.   No other history is available.

Blastic bone lesions are produced when the balance between osteoclasts and osteoblasts is shifted toward bone production.  Lytic bone metastases are created by a shift favoring ostoclasts.  Metastatic deposits do not directly destroy bone.
