Non-invasive imaging (CT w/ or without arthrography, standard arthrography, MR, MR arthrography) to delineate presence or absence of an unstable fragment. If identified, surgical intervention is likely. Factors in developing a treatment plan include patient's age, physical activity level, symptoms, anatomic location of lesion, and, finally, the orthopedist's preference.
1) Defect of lateral aspect of medial condyle (classic) - remodeling suggests chronicity.
2) No radioopaque loose bodies identified in the joint.
