Normal physical exam.  Labs unremarkable.
Spot fluoroscopic image of a hysterosalpingogram demonstrates a unicornuate uterus on the left with free spill of contrast material.
Unicornuate uterus
-Unicornuate Uterus
-Hysterosalpingogram of the left portion of a didelphys uterus (since the physical exam was normal, including visualization of the cervix, which was not duplicated, this diagnosis was excluded clinically, but not by the single image)
25 year old female presenting for infertility work-up.
Congential abnormalities of the vaginia and uterus occur in up to 3% of women and may not present themselves until the woman is trying to conceive.  Seven classes of congenital abnormalities are recognized by the American Fertility Society.

Class I is hypoplasia or agenesis of the mullerian system.  This is represented by hypoplasia or lack of the uterus, fallopian tubes, vagina, and ervix, or a combination of the above.  Renal agenesis may also occur.

Class II is demonstrated by a unilateral failure of a mullerian duct.  Our patient’s unicornuate uterus falls under this category.  The affected side may be completely absent or severely hypoplastic. 

Class III is uterus duplication, or, uterus didelphys.  Two cervices, uteruses, and fallopian tubes are completely separated.  There is one vagina, but this may be septated.  If there is unilateral vaginal atresia, there is high likelihood of unilateral renal agenesis.

Class IV is a bicornuate uterus.  There is one cervix, but there are two superior horns of the uterus.

Class V is a septate uterus.  Externally, the uterus appears normal, but an internal sepatation divides the right and left halves.

Class VI is an arcuate uterus.  This is usually considered a normal variant.

Class VII  are those anomalies associated with in utero exposure to DES.  Multiple abnormalities have been describes, but a “T-shaped” utereus is the classic abnormal finding.
