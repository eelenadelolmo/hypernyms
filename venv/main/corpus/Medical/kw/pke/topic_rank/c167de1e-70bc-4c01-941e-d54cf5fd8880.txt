The pattern seen in patients with cytic fibrosis is very similar to a chronic or acute interstital pattern of lung disease.  This is particulary so in the cases where other findings of CF are not present such as hilar adenopathy, hyperinflation, enlarged pulmonary arteries or upper lobe predominate mucous plugging or brochiectasis.  Age is a key indicator of CF in this case.
