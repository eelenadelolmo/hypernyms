Recent history of odonyphagia. Upon questioning patient stated she had been taking an antibiotic over the last couple of weeks which she thought was tetracycline.
Given the clinical history of antibiotic ingestion temporally correlating with symptoms, along with the age and immunocompetence of the patient pill ulceration in by far the most likely diagnosis.  As stated in the Factiod, tetracycline typically produces small esophageal ulcers which may suggest this case is atypical for that particular medication.
It was reccommended that a follow-up study be performed as clinically indicated.
