No specific treatment occurred. The patient was followed conservatively.

Subdural Hematoma
Acute subdural hematoma
36 hour old male neonate  with stressful birth history presents with acute seizure activity during breast feeding.
This was a very difficult fluid collection to see as it was only in 2 axial images. It almost appeared to be a prominent tentorium cerebelli at first. Thus, in neonates great care must be undertaken not to miss this type of finding.
