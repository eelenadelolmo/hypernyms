Radiologists often do not know the causative organism in cases of community acquired pneumonia (CAP).  When the agent is known, however, it is helpful to review the images to assist clinicians with future cases.  The frequency quoted in the medical literature supports the notion that many of the CAP cases thought to be early lobar pneumonia may actual be bronchopneumonia limited to a single lower lobe from Mycoplasmpa pneumoniae infection.
