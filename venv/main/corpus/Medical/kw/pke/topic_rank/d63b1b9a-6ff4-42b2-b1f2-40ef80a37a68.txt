Neurological exam reveals weakness and impaired reflexes of the lower extremity
The patient hasn't so far undergone surgical removal of the tumor. He is in good general clinical condition.
• Sagittal T2 weighted turbo spin echo image shows first degree anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 vertebra with cord compression, severe disc desiccation at L3-L4 level, vertebral endplate degenerative changes as well as a possible retroperitoneal mass lession.

• Abdominal MRI scan confirmed the presence of the retroperitoneal mass lession.
Retroperitoneal neurofibroma
• Tumors containing collagen fibers and myxoid stroma (Schwannoma ,Neurofibroma ,Retroperitoneal fibrosis ,Desmoid, Myxoid liposarcoma , Malignant fibrous histiocytoma , Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor)
• Metastases
• Lymphoma
• Retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy
• Extra adrenal pheochromocytoma
64 y.o.  man presents with low back pain and symptoms of sciatica
In terms of radiological methodology interpretation, this case signifies the importance of examining carefully the paraspinal and the retroperitoneal spaces when reporting MR examinations of the lumbar spine.

The tumor could have easily been missed since the clinical picture of the patient is readily (partly;) justified by the extensive degenerative spine disease.
