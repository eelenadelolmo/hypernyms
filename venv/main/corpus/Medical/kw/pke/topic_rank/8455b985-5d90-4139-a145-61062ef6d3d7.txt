Grade 3 Stress Fracture, Right Femoral Neck
Osteoid Osteoma
Stress Fracture
Progressive right hip pain, worsened with running or load-bearing activities.  No prior medical or trauma history.  Pain worsening over past two weeks.
Stress fractures and osteoid osteoma can have very similar radiographic and scintigraphic appearances; in equiviocal cases the two can usually be differentiated with T1-weighted MRI and characteristic features of patient history (e.g. night pain, relieved with asprin).  In this case, the patient's occupation as a military recruit, and the worsening of the pain with running, along with the characteristic location of the periosteal reaction on the plain films, clarifies the diagnosis.  Treatment for this patient is initially conservative.
