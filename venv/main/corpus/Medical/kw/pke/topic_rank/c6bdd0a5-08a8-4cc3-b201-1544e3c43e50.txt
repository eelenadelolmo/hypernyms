Patient was admitted to the general medical floor for evaluation and management. There was initial concern for an infectious etiology with the patient’s history of fevers and confusion.  Serial blood cultures were all no growth.  The patient was empirically started on Vancomycin, Rocephin and Acyclovir. Initial positive urin culture was thought to have been secondary to repeated catherizations.  Acyclrovir was stopped once HSV PCR was negative, and the rest of antibiotic regimen was completed for a ten day course. This was not thought to be an infectious process after review of the laboratory study results.  No noted masses on imaging, a normal bone scan, and a normal bone marrow aspirate analysis made the concern for malignancy less likely.  Presenting complaint of diffuse pain and fever with strong family history of autoimmune disease raised concern for a possible rheumatologic disorder such as JIA or SLE. With laboratory evaluation, the consulting Rheumatologist thought that the patient’s presentation was more consistent with a possible vasculitis. 
On further neurological examination, the patient was noted to have bilateral clonus and weakness of the lower extremities. She received three days of high dose steroid therapy after which she had remarkable improvement in her symptoms.  She was ddischarged home after a ten day hospitalization with out-patient follow-up with Neurology and Rheumatology with the diagnosis of transverse mellitus.
However, she returned to the ED just five days after her discharge home and was readmitted to the hospital for recurrence of symptoms that included: head ache, urinary retention, change in mental status/confusion, and difficulty with ambulation, fever and left eye drifting. Further laboratory and imaging studies were obtained and no infectious cause identified.  Preliminary diagnoses of transverse meylitis from the first hospital admit was reconsidered. During her second admission, she received five days of IV steroid therapy.  She had resolution of her symptoms and was discharged home on continued oral steroid therapy.  Final diagnosis upon discharge home with consideration of laboratory and imaging evaluation and consulting expertise was ADEM.
4/20 MRI C/T/L W/O & W CNTR:  Impression: Suggestion of very subtle/mild T2 prolongation in the central white matter of the cord from about C4-T2. This could potentially represent early/mild transverse myelitis. 

4/20 MRI Brain W/O & W, COW MRA: Impression: 1. The mild T2 prolongation in the cerebral sulci described on yesterday's exam is again seen on the axial FLAIR images, however this finding is seen fairly frequently in patient's receiving supplemental oxygen during brain MRI and is likely not clinically significant. 2. Pineal cyst. 3. Otherwise normal study.   
NUC Bone Scan whole body ECG and Echo:  normal study 
4/28 MRI Brain W/ & W/O Contrast:  Impression: Questionable area of increased signal at the body of the corpus callosum is felt to represent volume averaging of adjacent cortical gray matter. The brain has a normal appearance without evidence of breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. 

5/4 MRI Brain W/ and W/O Contrast: Impression: Small patchy areas of T2 prolongation are now demonstrated in the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, right corpus callosum, right cerebral peduncle, and middle cerebellar peduncles bilaterally. Given the patient's clinical history, this may represent acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Although less likely, the differential diagnosis would also include childhood onset of multiple sclerosis.

4 y/o previously healthy girl presentsto the ED with a two week history of fever, PNA for which she was treated with two courses of antibiotics, worsening abdominal pain, urinary retention and increased difficulty with ambulation.  During this two week time frame, she had a bowel clean out and required three straight catheterizations for urinary retention.  She had been seen by her primary care provider and in the ED with treatment for presumed PNA, constipation, and urinary retention on several occurrences over these past two weeks.  Parents expressed concern for weight loss of approximately three pounds during this time frame.  The mother also reported that the patient seemed very sensitive to touch and movement as if “everything hurt her” over the preceding days to her admission.
This patient’s initial presentation was concerning for autoimmune and/or infectious etiology affecting her central nervous system.  Preliminary diagnosis of acute transverse myelitis, sometimes refered to as acute transverse myelopathy,  is characterized by an acutely developing, rapidly progressing lesion affecting the spinal cord.  Onset of disease may occur during active infection or as a post-infectious demyelinating disorder.  Cases have also been reported post-vaccination, autoimmune or as systemic malignancy.  Any segment of the spinal column may be affected, although there is increased predominance for the thoracic cord with multilevel involvement common.  Neuroimaging is recommended for evaluation of conditions that can mimic acute transverse myelitis: acute disk herniation, hematoma, epidural abscess, or compression myelopathies.  During the acute phase, MR scans can be normal and nonspecific.  T1 may show focal cord enlargement and T2 with poorly delineated hyperintensities as the most commonly identified abnormalities. 
With the presumptive diagnosis of transverse myelitis, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) was also considered.  Although MS is considered an adult disease, symptoms can begin during childhood (before the age of 5).  Presenting symptoms can be as subtle as school problems to more pronounced with paresthesias, cerebral edema, meningismus and impaired consciousness.  MR imaging is the study of choice in diagnosis of MS and in the evaluation of disseminated lesions.  Lesions typically are sharply marginated with prolongation of T1 and T2 relaxation times.  T2-weighted images might show a central area of very high signal intensity surrounded by peripheral area of moderately high intensity.  New lesions generally enhance on average for three weeks.  Tumefactive plaques in the brainstem and spinal cord might be present with extensive swelling with MR signal changes suggestive of neoplasm.  Tumefactive plaques may be differentiated from tumors by presence of other typical plaques and lack of mass effect.  Plaques will be adjacent to ventricular surface and enhancement will be limited to one side of the lesion.   Some MS lesions will have higher intensity on precontrast T1-weighted images necessitating precontrast and postcontrast evaluation if magnetization transfer is used.  Magnetization transfer, diffusion tensor imaging that shows reduced anisotropy in affected white matter, and FLAIR sequences will show abnormalities in MS patients in cases where MR may appear normal.  Magnetization transfer techniques are also helpful in distinguishing inflammation that occurs in MS from demylination, which demonstrates more reduction of magnetization transfer.   
Another difficult distinction to make is that between MS and Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM).  ADEM has also been referred to as paainfectious encephalomyelitis.  It is an immune-mediated response to a preceding viral infection, vaccination and less commonly a bacterial infection or drug ingestion.  Acute demyelination is thought to be caused by antibody-antigen complexes.  Perivascular, mostly perivenular, inflammatory (mostly mononuclear) infiltrates are seen. With disease resolution, there is increased perivascular astrocytosis. Incidence in unknown with occurrence seen in all ages, although, most cases are seen in children and young adults.  There is typically abrupt onset with neurologic symptoms evident in one to three weeks after insult. There is a rapid clinical course with multifocal symptoms consisting of but not limited to: headache, fever, vomiting, nuchal rigidity, seizures, focal neurologic deficits, coma and death. Some patients will have full recovery while others may have permanent neurologic impairment (10-30%).  Neurologic findings typically evolve and resolve over several weeks.  MR is preferred to CT in evaluating for ADEM.  Multifocal subcortical hyperintense foci are present on T2-weighted images.  The disease process can involve the deep white matter, brainstem, and cerebellum.  Cortical and deep gray matter may be involved, although to a lesser extent than white matter.  Moderate to large areas of demylination (prolonged T1 and T2 on MR) can be found on subcortical white matter.  Lesions are usually bilateral but asymmetric.  ADEM is usually nonhemorrhagic on MR. Some lesions may also enhance with contrast administration. Periventricular white matter is involved in half of patients with ADEM, whereas, 90% involvement may be seen in MS.  The corpus callosum is more commonly involved in MS than ADEM.  MR may demonstrate abnormalities of the deep cerebral nuclei in as many as 50% of pediatric patients.  
In differentiation ADEM from vasculitis, diffusion images show increased water motion in the foci of demyelination in the acute and subacute phase of ADEM.  Lesions from vasculitis show reduced diffusion in the acute phase.  In ADEM, T2 changes in the brain evolve with time and typically correlate to the clinical symptoms.  Follow-up MR studies may show worsening as clinical symptoms begin to improve.  With concern for vasculitis, vascular imaging may illustrate vasculitis or venous occlusion and focal infarcts. 
There are a number of disorders that may present with acute neurologic findings similar to our patient and should be considered in the differential during the evaluation and management.  Etiology may be infectious, autoimmune/immunologic, traumatic, or oncologic.  Thorough and appropriate laboratory and imaging evaluation will guide medical diagnosis.
