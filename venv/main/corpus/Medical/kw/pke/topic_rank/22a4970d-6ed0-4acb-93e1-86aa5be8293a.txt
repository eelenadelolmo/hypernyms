21 y.o. woman reservist, activated & deployed into Iraq in March.

Air evacuated to Germany and then subsequently to WRAMC in mid July for dyspnea.

Pulmonology evaluation made a diagnosis of asthma, and she was started on PO steroid burst w/ taper, albuterol, Advair and Singulaire.  

R-sided visual loss (OD) started shortly after initiating these asthma meds and remained stable over next 1-2 weeks.  She then reported “I can’t see person standing to my right”. 

She denied any sudden onset - but is unable to pinpoint the moment when her symptoms began nor recall what she was doing; no “falling curtain”.

- no central vision loss OU

- no vision changes OS

- no floaters, photopsia or amaurosis 

- no headache, eye pain or photophobia 

- no gross neurologic symptoms (diplopia, dysarthria, weakness, parasthesias, confusion)

- PMH/PSH: 
     recent asthma dx

- FH: 
     non-contributory

- Social Hx:
     no tobacco/rare EtOH
     1 previous sexual partner 2 years ago

- Meds:
     PO Prednisone taper (currently 20mg qd)
     Albuterol
     Singular
     Advair
     OCP 

-Allergies: 
     PCN
- 10-15% of all intracranial tumors
- normal volunteers had 10% incidence of asymptomatic adenomas by MRI

- Found in 1.5-27% of autopsy cases

Patients present with either:
     Hormonal abnormalities
     Symptoms of compressive lesion: headache, field    
     defects or cranial nerve palsies (cavernous sinus  
     invasion) 

Genetic Association:
     MEN type 1: 
          30% of patients have pit adenoma
          Triad with parathyroid and pancreatic islet           
          tumors
     GSP:
          Gene that encodes alpha-subunit of     
          GTP-binding protein Gs
          mutation leads to activation of cAMP
     Present in:
          40% of GH-secretors
          10% of null cell (non-secretors)
          6% of ACTH-secretors

Classification:
     Based on size:
          Macroadenoma > 1cm
          Microadenoma < 1cm
     Based on what the tumor secretes:
          Prolactin, gonadotropin, GH, ACTH, TSH
          nothin’ (null cell)

Surgery:
     For most non-prolactin secreting adenomas
     Usually trans-sphenoidal:
          Mortality <1%
          Common complications: nasal septal            
          perforation, ant. pit insufficiency,  
          transient diabetes insipidus, CSF leak
          Carotid injury and vision loss are RARE

     Success measures clinically and radiographically
     Normalization of hormones varies with type/size of   
     tumor
     Normalization of visual fields = 16-53%
     Improvement of visual fields = 26-70%

Treatment of Prolactinomas:
     MEDICAL (dopamine agonists)
     - PRL secretion inhibited by dopamine secretion  
     from the hypothalamus

     - Decreases tumor size      (70-90% of cases)
     - Normalizes PRL levels     (70-90% of cases)
     - Restores ovulation/menses (70-90% of cases)
     - Improves visual fields    (70-90% of cases)

     "REVERSIBLE, therefore lifelong tx is RULE"

Drugs:
     Bromocriptine (classic—used for decades)
     Side effects: N/V, dizziness, postural    
     hypotension, HA’s

Newer agents:
     Lisuride
     Pergolide
     Cabergoline

New txs for non-PRL adenomas:
     GH-secretors:
          Somatostatin analogs: octreotide & lanreotide
          Reduce GH levels in 90% of pts 
          achieve complete suppression in 50% of pts

Radiation:
     Usually reserved for residual dz or recurrence   
     after surgery
     Average total dose = 45-50 Gy
     Control rates of 85-95% @ 10 years

3 types:
     Standard
     Stereotactic fractionated
     Stereotactic radiosurgery (single dose / Gamma     
     knife)

Disadvantages:
      Slower reversal of neurologic symptoms
      Slower drop in hormonal levels
      Hypopituitarism: 50% of pts will have at least     
      one pit hormone deficiency @ 5 yrs       lifelong   
      follow-up
Secondary brain tumor:
      Risk of 1.3-1.7% @ 10 yrs
      Risk of 1.9-2.7% @ 20 yrs
      (relative risk of 9.3-16 X general population)
      Radiation-induced optic neuropathy/retinopathy
      Low risk: 0.7-2%

SRS(stereotactic radiosurgery)
       Quicker drop in hormone levels
       Adverse CNS effects in 28% of cases at 3 yrs    
       compared with 0% with FSRT3
