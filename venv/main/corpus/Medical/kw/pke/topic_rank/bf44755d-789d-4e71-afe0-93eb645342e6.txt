Physical Exam and Laboratory: Left breast tenderness on palpation.  No masses, nodules or changes in the skin.
Treatment and Follow-up: Pt had MRI guided placement of a wire.  Breast was reimaged with mammogram after the wire placement to help the surgeon better locate the mass.  A 6 mm focus of DCIS was excised.
Image Findings: Breast MRI showed spiculated enhancing mass in anterior 1/3 of Left breast.
Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS)
Differential Diagnosis for these findings in this case: 
Malignant neoplasmâ€”ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma, inflammatory carcinoma
Fibroadenoma
Abscess
History (can include gestational age, or age in days, weeks, months): 59 y/o female with focal left breast pain x 2-3 months with increased risk by the Gail model.  Mammogram was normal.  Breast ultrasound was normal without any evidence of mass or cystic structure.
Discussion (include references): Given the increased use of mammographic screening over the past few decades, the DCIS is the most rapidly growing subgroup of breast cancer.  DCIS was newly diagnosed over 55,000 times in 2003.  As a direct precursor to invasive breast cancer, diagnosing DCIS is important to preventing widespread disease.   For a pt such as this, where mammography and US showed no abnormalities, but she was still having pain, MRI is a logical next step.  Almost all invasive cancers will enhance with gadolinium on MRI (95-100% sensitivity); it is less for DCIS.  However, in this pt it did enhance.  Also of note, MRI can be helpful in determining the extent of disease spread posteriorly (chest wall, muscle, etc.)  However, the routine use of breast MRI is being studied and compared with that of mammagraphy.  MRI is often much more expensive, less available, and may have a higher false positive rate for enhancing benign lesions.
