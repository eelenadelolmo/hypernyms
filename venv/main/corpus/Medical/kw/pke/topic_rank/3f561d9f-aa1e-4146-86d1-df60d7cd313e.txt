Large mass within the medial left lobe of the liver superiorly.  Arterial phase imaging demonstrates a hypoattenuating mass with peripheral nodular enhancement that, on subsequent delayed sequences demonstrates centripetal fill in of contrast.  Of note, on all sequences, the enhancing component of the mass follows the aortic level of enhancement.

Woman evaluated for right upper quadrant pain.
This was incidental (as is often the case). The patient's symptoms resolved without treatment of the hemangioma.  Key to differentiation of this mass from other general liver masses as listed in the differential diagnosis is the characteristic enhancement pattern, with complete fill in and persistent enhancement evident on 10 minute delay.
