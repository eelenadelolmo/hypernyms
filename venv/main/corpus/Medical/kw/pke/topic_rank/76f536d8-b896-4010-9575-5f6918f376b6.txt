None; curettage and bone grafting if the structural stability of the affected bone is compromised.
A geographic, lobulated, well marginated, radiolucent, expansile, medulary lesion with a thin rim of sclerosis and central calcific densities is seen on plain radiograph in the posterior aspect of the metadiaphysis of the distal right femur without cortical destruction.  T1 and T2 weighted magnetic resonance images show the lesion to have signal isointense to fat and a sclerotic rim.
intraosseous lipoma of the distal femur confirmed by MRI
Aneurysmal bone cyst, fibrous dysplasia, simple bone cyst, enchondroma, and bone infarct.
