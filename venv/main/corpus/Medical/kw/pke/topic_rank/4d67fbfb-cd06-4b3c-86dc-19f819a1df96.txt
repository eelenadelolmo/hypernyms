Palpable bilateral breast masses measuring 3 - 4 cm.    (Editor's note: no family history was provided for this case.)
Excision of the lesions cause the patient discomfort.  Mammography and ultrasound at six months followed by regular yearly screening.
Cephalocaudal/mediolateral oblique film mammograms are presented for review.  The breast tissue is extremely dense.  This may ower the sensitivity of mammography.  There is no evidence of discrete mass, microcalcifications, or architectural distortion to suggest malignancy on these mammograms.  (Editors note: spot images of the areas of palpable the abnormalities, although appropriate, were not presented for review.  Comparison studies are likewise not presented for this case.)  The assessment catagory based solely of the mammograms presented would be Category 0: need additional imaging evaluation and/or prior mammograms for comparison.

The radiologist in this case appropriately ordered bilateral ultrasound examination of the areas of palpable abnormalities.

The ultrasound backround echotexture is homogeneous backround echotexture:fibroglandular bilaterally.  The shapes of both masses are irregular.  The orientations of both masses are not parallel.  The margins of both masses are not circumscribed and the margins of both are spiculated.  The echo patterns of both lesions are enechoic.  Both lesions exhibit posterior acoutic shadowing.  This constellation of findings would usually places these lesions in assessment catagory 4.  Bilateral biopsy in strongly recommended.
Diabatic mastopathy
1. Invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma
2. radial scar
3. diabetic mastopathy
4. lymphoma
35 y.o. white female with early onset Type II diabetes mellitis presents for mammographic evaluation of bilateral palpable breast masses measuring approximately 3-4cm on exam.
