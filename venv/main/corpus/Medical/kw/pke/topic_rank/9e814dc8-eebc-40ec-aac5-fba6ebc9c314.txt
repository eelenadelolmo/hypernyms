Films show a barium filled defect in the gastric mucosa on the greater curvature of the fundus with the crater bottom extending beyond the lumen of the stomach.  Films show a pendulous appendage with smooth borders containing residual barium.  The mucosal folds appear to end at the ulcer edge.  There does not appear to be any heaping of the ulcer edges.  There is no adjacent mass.  Crater cavity changes shape from film to film.

52yo caucasian female who presents with several day history of epigastric pain.
Gastric diverticulum are rare, usually single, and most commonly located on the posterior portion of the fundus.  They are thought by some to be a throwback to the multiple stomach reminants and by others to be acquired lesions secondary to a localized area of muscle weakness.  Most nonfundal diverticuli are caused by inflammation and fibrosis.  The morphology is that of a smooth-walled pouch connected to the stomach by a narrower neck traversed by mucosal folds.  They are usually symptomless and are differentiated from an ulcer by the lack of an ulcer mound or radiating folds.  They also tend to contract with the contractions of the stomach (as evidenced by its changing shape)
