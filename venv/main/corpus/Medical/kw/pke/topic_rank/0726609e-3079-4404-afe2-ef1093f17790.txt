Upper GI shows persistant incomplete distension/incomplete filling of the second portion of the duodenum with a normal mucosal pattern.

Contrast enhanced CT shows pancreatic tissue encircling the second portion of the duodenum.
Annular Pancreas
Not really applicable in this case.  A pancreatic mass would tend not to encircle the pancreas in this fashion.  Given the normal fold pattern and symmetry, an intrinsic duodenal mass or inflammatory process would be unlikely.
