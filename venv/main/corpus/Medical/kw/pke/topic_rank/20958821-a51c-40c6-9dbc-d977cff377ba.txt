Patient will be further staged with FDG PET scan, with treatment to follow.
The initial exam was the V/Q scan, which suggested a central, probably mediastinal mass-effect. Subsequent CXR demonstrates a large anterior mediastinal mass, extending into the right hemithorax.  CT confirms the mass, which is in the anterior mediastinum, displacing the SVC anteriorly.
Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Nodular Sclerosing Subtype
-Teratoma
-Lymphoma (Hodgkin's vs Non-H)
-Thymoma
-Metastatic disease
Progressive dyspnea and decreased exercise tolerance.
The first study ordered for this patient was the V/Q scan.  The provider's concern and reason for the V/Q scan request was; "r/o chronic thromboembolic disease".  Had the patient had a routine CXR 1st, the presumptive diagnosis of lymphoma could have been made and an unnecessary V/Q scan likely avoided.  Space occupying mediastinal lesions are a known cause of non-embolic V/Q mismatches.
