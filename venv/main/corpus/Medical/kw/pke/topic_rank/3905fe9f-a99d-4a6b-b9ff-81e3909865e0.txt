Neuroblastoma vs. resolving adrenal hemorrhage
3 month old white male infant,inpatient with chronic lung disease and history of recurrent aspiration, for which a CT was performed, demonstrating a calcified right adrenal mass
The differential diagnosis of a calcified adrenal mass in a young infant is neuroblastoma and resolving adrenal hemorrhage. The prognosis of infants under the age of one year with neuroblastoma is excellent, so, as long as there is no other evidence of neuroblastoma (such as liver metastases, it is acceptable to wait one month for a follow-up ultrasound. Ultrasound was performed but the adrenal was not visualized on follow-up exam, nor was a mass visualized.
