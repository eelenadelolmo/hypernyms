Large sellar/suprasellar heterogenous mass w/ cystic component.  Cystic component hyperintense on T2 FLAIR sequence.  Enhancing non-cystic component.

Pituitary adenoma
Presents with 1 week history of temporal field visual loss.
The cystic appearance and MR characteristics were suggestive of a craniopharyngioma.  The fluid-fluid level and acute visual symptoms are suggestive of intratumoral hemorrhage or necrosis in a pituitary macroadenoma.  However, the isointense signal on the T1W MR is not consistent with methemoglobin - that would be expected in a week-old hematoma.  The acute presentation with hemorrhage is sometimes called "pituitary apoplexy".
