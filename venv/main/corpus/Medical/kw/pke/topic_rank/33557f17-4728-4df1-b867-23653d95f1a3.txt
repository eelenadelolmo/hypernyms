Initial axial CT images through the pelvis demonstrate a paucity of contrast in the rectum.   There is no contrast material in the vagina.  The patient is status post hysterectomy. Delayed axial CT images through the pelvis, obtained 6 hours after the initial scan reveal contrast within the bladder and rectum.  No contrast material is noted within the vagina. Rectal contrast was administered, with subsequent axial CT images through the pelvis with rectal tube and balloon in place, demonstrating contrast material within the vagina.  A fistula tract is not visualized.   The rectal tube was removed, and the patient was reimaged.  Contrast material is again noted within the vagina.  Additionally, there is soft tissue stranding posterior to the vagina, and anterior to the rectum, which may represent the fistula tract.  Fluoroscopic images from a barium enema demonstrate a rectovaginal fistula.  Although a fistula tract is not clearly visualized, contrast is noted to pass from the anterior rectum to the vagina.
