Lung pleural fluid (from cavity): Squamous Cell Cancer
(-) AFB
Gram stain: Few Gram (+) Cocci, moderate beaded branching gram (+) rods
A CT guided drain was placed secondary to poor response to antibiotics.  The fluid from the "cavity" had squamous cell CA cells
01 Dec CXR: Approximately 3 x 4 x 5 cm flame-shaped density lesion in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe with slightly irregular margins and adjacent pleural thickening at the upper chest wall. Right mid lung peripheral opacity which may represent focal atelectasis or hemorrhage.  Linear calcification in both diaphragmatic pleura.

15 Dec CXR: Approximately 5 cm cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe.  There is an air-fluid level within the cavity.

CT: Cavitary mass measuring 4.3 x 5.3 cm with an air-fluid level, irregular thick wall, and adjacent inflammatory change, and parenchymal destruction of the adjacent lung in the right upper lobe. Inferior to this is abroad area of abnormal attenuation in the dependent right upper lobe, which is confluent about the airway and infiltrative in appearance surrounding it. Bilateral pleural calcification at the apices of the hemidiaphragms and pleural fluid/thickening consistent with prior asbestos exposure. Bilateral pleural fluid collections.
Cavitary lung nodule
Bacteria infection
Fungal infection
Atypical mycobacterial infection
Squamous Cell Carcinoma
metastases
Known history of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Rule out pneumonia
Although the fluid from the cavity demonstrated both SCCA and bacteria, the short time span for the development of the cavity suggests the etiology is from an infection and less likely squamous cell carcinoma.
