None, as it is a normal variant.
Incidentally noted is a normal variant cavum 
septum pellucidum and vergae in an otherwise unremarkable CT of the head.
Cavum septum pellucidum and vergae.
-cavum velum interpositum 
-symmetric midline brain cyst
Pt imaged for recurrent, worsening headaches of sudden onset, and not responsive to medications.  No history of head trauma or loss of conciousness.
