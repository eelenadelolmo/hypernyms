Acute chest syndrome
22 yo woman with chest pain and shortness of breath.
Acute chest syndrome is the leading cause of death in patients with sickle cell disease.  It is not entirely understood but fat embolism and infection are typically the causative agents.  It is not the same entity as "pain crisis" although it often follows such and episode.  Treatment typically includes intravenous and oral antibiotics and fluids, bronchodilators if necessary, oxygen and pain control.  Transfusions may be necessary.
