Multiple fractures of bilateral extremities immediately postpartum.  The patient had no scleral discoloration.
This patient may have to have intramedullary rods placed to correct bowing deformities and strengthen the bone to avoid new fractures.
Conventional radiographs of the upper and lower extremities demonstrate generalized osteopenia, deformity and multiple fractures of the ribs, bilateral humeri, radii, ulnae, femora, tibiae, and fibulae with extensive surrounding callus formation.
Osteogenesis imperfecta
Osteogenesis Imperfecta
Hypophosphatasia
Nonaccidental trauma
Congenital insensitivity to pain
Juvenile osteoporosis
Newborn boy with multiple fractures.
Given the patientâ€™s normal sclerae but multiple fractures immediately postpartum, these findings are most consistent with OI type III.
Radiographically, a progressive kyphoscoliosis may be seen, wormian bones are present, and multiple (healing) fractures are noted in gracile, osteopenic bones.  Prenatal US may show multiple fractures, demineralized calvaria, and a femur length more than 3 standard deviations below the mean for gestational age.
