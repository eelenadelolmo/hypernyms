Tenderness to palpation along the tibial shafts bilaterally.
Conservative treatment is effective, however diligence in avoidance of activity must be observed.  For military personnel, a waiver to preclude mandatory physical activity participation is needed to protect the patient from further injury - especially in young, motivated individuals.
Bone Scan
1.  Blood flow and pool images show focal increased radiotracer accumulation in the medial aspect of the right mid calf as well as to a lesser extent the left midcalf, slightly superior compared to the right.
     
2.  Delayed anterior and posterior planar images from the pelvis to the feet demonstrate normal biodistribution of the radiotracer within the soft tissues as well as the genitourinary system.
   
3.  There is focal, intense increased radiotracer accumulation in a fusiform fashion along the posteromedial cortex of the right mid tibia, encompassing greater than 75% of the cortical thickness. There is a similar finding in the left posteromedial tibia, at the junction of the mid and proximal thirds, encompassing between 50 and 75% of the cortical thickness. There is mild diffuse activity along the tibial cortex bilaterally, consistent with shin splints. Mild activity in the knees and ankles is consistent withstress change.

Plain Films
Periosteal reaction of the posteromedial mid-shaft of the right tibia and posterior proximal shaft of the left tibia consistent withfocal stress changes which correspond directly with stress fractures identified on the comparison bone scan.  No frank fracture lucencies are evident. 

The remaining visualized osseous structures demonstrate normal mineralization and alignment without subluxation, dislocation, or significant degenerative changes.  Visualized soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
Bilateral Tibial Stress Fractures
• Stress Fracture
• Stress Reactive Change
• Shin Splints
20 year-old active duty woman with diffuse bilateral lower extremity pain from the knees down.
Plain film findings are often not present - especially in the acute setting.  In this case, there is excellent correlation between the bone scan and plain film findings.
