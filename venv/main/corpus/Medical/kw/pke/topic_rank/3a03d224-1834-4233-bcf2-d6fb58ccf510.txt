Twin B OG-tube not properly placed due to inability to advance adequately.
2/6 systolic murmur heard best at the LLSB with fixed S2.
Small anteriorly placed anus. 
Small right thenar eminence.
On day-of-life 2, Twin B underwent surgery to remove the tracheoesphageal fistula and to anastomose the esophagus.  Patient tolerated procedure well and there were no complications.
Serial esophagraphy should be performed at 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year of age since most neonates who undergo surgical correction of TEF/EA will have some degree of esophageal dysmotility.  Other possible complications include stricture formation, fistula recurrence, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
Pt should remain on ranitidine and metoclopramide for up to one year for GERD precaution.
Cardiology will reevaluate ASD at 8 months.
