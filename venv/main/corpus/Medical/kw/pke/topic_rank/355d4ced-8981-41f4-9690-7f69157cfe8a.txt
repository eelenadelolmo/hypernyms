5 mm x 9 mm lesion within the right IAC which demonstrates isointense signal to grey matter and uniform enhancement.
Vestibular ('Acoustic') Schwannoma
Meningioma
Epidermoid
Schwannoma (trigeminal, vestibular, etc.)
47 year old female with long term hearing loss and recent disequilibrium problems.
Schwannomas may demonstrate increased signal on T2 weighted sequences. When present, this is due to the presence of Antoni B type histology which is characterized by looser areolar tissue with lower cell density versus Antoni A histology which is denser and more cellular. This particular lesion does not show does not show hyperintensity, and therefore would be expected to display predominantly Antoni A histology.
