TTP left wrist with decreased ROM.
Surgical repair (K-wire fixation).
Frontal radiograph of the wrist shows a "pie shaped" lunate.  Lateral radiograph shows the lunate to be tilted and dislocated volarly, with the capitate remaining nearly collinear with the radius.  There is an associated ulnar styloid fracture visible on both images.
Lunate dislocation
Lunate dislocation (stage IV injury)
Midcarpal dislocation (stage III injury)
(There is often overlap of radiographic appearance of these two entities.)
23-year-old male with left wrist pain following fall on outstretched hand (FOOSH).
