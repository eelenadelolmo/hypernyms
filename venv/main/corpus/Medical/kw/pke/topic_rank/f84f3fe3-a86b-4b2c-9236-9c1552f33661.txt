Texto: 
Slightly hetergeneous mass in the supracerebellar cistern (posterior fossa) extending through tentorial opening into the quadrigeminal cistern.
Epidermoid Inclusion Cyst
<li>Arachnoid cyst
<li>Epidermoid cyst
<li>Dermoid cyst
<li>Teratoma
<li>Parasitic cyst
Middle aged patient with chronic headache, slowly progressive.
If you look carefully, you can see that the lesion is not completely homogeneous (CSF should be) and it is not exactly isointense to CSF.  It does not "suppress" on the FLAIR.  Also, the diffusion weighted image (DWI) shows restricted water motion in the mass (bright) compared to the low signal of CSF in the ventricles and subarachnoid space.  The lesion does not enhance.
