Unremarkable physical exam.  Normal prenatal labs.
A cerclage was in place prior to the ultrasound study.  Follow-up imaging is indicated as the pregnancy progresses to assess stability of the sutures and competence of the cervix.
One sagittal image of the cervix using the transabdominal technique demonstrates a long but widely dilated cervix.  The external os is closed, and a cerclage is in place (not well visualized).
Incompetent Cervix
Incompetent cervix
29 year-old G5P0 with history of previous 2nd trimester abortions presents for obstetric anatomic ultrasound.  Cervical cerclage had been performed 5 days prior to imaging.
This women presented with a classic history for cervical incompetence:  multiple 2nd trimester abortions.  As stated in the factoid, there are no standardized criteria for the diagnosis of cervical incompetence.  In this case, subjective evaluation of the appearance of the cervix is adequate, as this cervix, displaying an "hourglass" appearance, is markedly abnormal.
