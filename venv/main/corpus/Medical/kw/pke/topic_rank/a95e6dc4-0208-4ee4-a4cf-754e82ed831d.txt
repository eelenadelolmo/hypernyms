Weak distal pulses - Severe pain.
ORIF successful with return of distal pulses.  Surgeons report that patient may have nerve damage with sensory and motor defects in the median nerve distribution.
Initial images demonstrate complete transverse supracondylar fracture of the humerus with greater than 1 full shaft width posterior displacement and anterior angulation of the distal fracture fragment.  Some smaller fragments consistent with communition.  Radial capitellar line is preserved.

Post-op images demonstrate correction of posterior displacement and anterior angulation status post ORIF with 2 K-wires.  There is mild distal residual displacement of the medial epicondyle.
