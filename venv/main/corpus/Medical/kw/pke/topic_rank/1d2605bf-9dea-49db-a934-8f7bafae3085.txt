• T1 weighted image shows lesions.
• T1 weighted image post contrast shows enhanced rings representing capsules of abscess. 
• Diffusion Weighted Image shows bright area suggestive of restricted diffusion.
Brain Abscess (Gram positive Cocci)
• Tumor (metastasis)
• Abscess (Septic spread from lung?)
