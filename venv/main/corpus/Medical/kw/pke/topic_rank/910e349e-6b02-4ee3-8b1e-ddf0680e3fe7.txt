Patient is acutely tender to palpation along the mid to distal Achilles tendon.  Ability to plantar and dorsiflex is noted.
Conservative therapy including rest and icing.
There is no fracture, subluxation or dislocation.  An os peroneum is noted, which is a normal accessory ossicle.  Visualized soft tissues are remarkable for thickening of the mid to distal Achilles tendon, most
prominent approximately 3.5 cm from the calcaneus with abnormal soft tissue density within adjacent fat suggestive of hematoma.
