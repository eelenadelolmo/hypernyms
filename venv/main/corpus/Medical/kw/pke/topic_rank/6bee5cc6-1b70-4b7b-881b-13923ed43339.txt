Excision and drainage.
There is expansion of the left frontal sinus with extension into the upper aspect of the left ethmoid air cells. Impression of the globe with considerable proptosis is identified. There is some absence of bone posteriorly and medially although dura is probably present covering this large probable mucocele. There is also indentation into the lateral wall of the inferior aspect of the left ethmoid air cell group by fat that may represent a response to long standing proptosis. The left nasolacrimal duct is poorly defined and distortion or obstruction of the latter cannot be excluded.
