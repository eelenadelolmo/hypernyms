CT ABD/PELVIS
1. There is a massive low density soft tissue mass comprising the majority of the anterior and mid abdomen as well as the pelvis. The mass demonstrates enhancing septations. It is predominantly low density. Some of the areas of the mass more centrally are lower density than the more peripheral portions of the mass. The mass almost certainly is malignant. Tissue sampling is recommended. In the right abdomen there is small low density area which may represent loculated ascites or another component of the soft tissue mass as described above.
2. There is a small amount of abdominal and pelvic ascites which may be malignant as well. 
3. There are bilateral pleural effusions and dense consolidation in the lung bases.
4. The gallbladder is distended and there is a small amount of pericholecystic fluid. This is nonspecific.
Pleomorphic Liposarcoma
Malignant neoplasm
44 year-old male with hx of H. Pylori and gastric ulcers, admitted for pre-op treatment.  Patient presented to outside hospital for abdominal mass and dysuria 12/05, imaging followed by needle biopsy which was diagnosed as a "gastrointestinal stromal tumor".  Surgery consult at that time suggested neo-adjuvant therapy to shrink the tumor before consideration of surgery.  Pt took Gleevac for 2 months with no effect on tumor growth. Was then switched to Sutant for 1 month, which he stopped a few days prior to admission because of nausea and vomiting.   Pain progressed from dysuria to diffuse abdominal pain over the first month, but is currently well controlled on oral morphine.  Appetite is present, but pt is unable to eat normal volumes of food because of nausea and vomiting.  According to family, he has lost 20+ lbs since the onset of symptoms 8 months ago.   MIld pain in legs and SOB while supine.
ROS: (+) wt. loss of 20+ lbs, intermittent SOB while supine, sometimes sees flashing lights, significant weakness and fatigue, mild dysuria, N/V, reflux, constipation (d/t narcotics), pain in legs and edema.
No fevers, chills, cough, hemoptysis.  
No chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion.  
No diarrhea, melena/BRBPR. 
No hematuria.  
No headache, numbness, lightheadedness

Liposarcoma is a malignancy of fat cells. In adults, it is the most common soft tissue sarcoma. Liposarcoma normally appears as a slowly enlarging, painless, nonulcerated submucosal mass in a middle-aged person, but some lesions grow rapidly and become ulcerated early. Virchow first described liposarcoma in the 1860s. 

The development of a liposarcoma from a preexisting benign lipoma is rare. Most cases arise de novo. Liposarcomas most frequently arise from the deep-seated stroma rather than the submucosal or subcutaneous fat. The most recent World Health Organization classification of soft tissue tumors recognizes 5 categories of liposarcomas: (1) well differentiated, which includes the adipocytic, sclerosing, and inflammatory subtypes; (2) dedifferentiated; (3) myxoid; (4) round cell; and (5) pleomorphic. 


The anatomical distribution of liposarcoma appears to be partly related to the histologic type. Well-differentiated liposarcoma tends to occur in deep soft tissues of both the limbs and the retroperitoneum. Myxoid and/or round-cell liposarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas have a striking predilection for the limbs, and dedifferentiated liposarcoma occurs predominantly in the retroperitoneum. Although any liposarcoma subtype occasionally arises in the subcutis, involvement of the dermis appears to be exceedingly rare.

The overall 5-year survival rate of patients with deep high-grade liposarcoma is less than 50%. 
Metastases are common, especially in poorly differentiated liposarcomas. The lungs and the liver are the most common sites of metastasis. 

Primary cutaneous liposarcoma has an indolent course. 
No association with race or geography is known. Liposarcomas are slightly more common in males than in females. 
The mean patient age at onset is 50 years. 

Although liposarcomas account for about 17% of all soft tissue sarcomas, they are involved in only 4% of childhood soft tissue sarcomas. Cases of liposarcoma are reported in young adults and teenagers, but cases in children are rare. 

In the case of well-differentiated liposarcoma, grade provides no incremental information over other histological subtypes in terms of response to therapy. In myxoid/round cell liposarcoma, the presence of a round cell component may be an adverse prognostic sign. Tumor site, a high proliferative fraction noted with MIB-1 labeling, and TP53 missense mutations are also adverse prognostic factors in myxoid/round cell tumors.

The prognosis is affected by the type of liposarcoma present.
The well-differentiated type and most myxoid types have favorable prognoses, with 100% and 88% 5-year survival rates, respectively. However, these tumors are poorly circumscribed and locally recur after incomplete excision. Although they rarely metastasize, repeated local recurrences may cause the tumor to evolve into a higher grade of sarcoma or to dedifferentiate, in which case metastasis is possible.
The form that a dermatologist is most likely to examine at biopsy is 1 of the 3 subtypes of a well-differentiated liposarcoma, that is, the lipomalike liposarcoma or atypical lipoma; the other 2, inflammatory and sclerosing, are less likely. The clinical outcome of this subtype is best predicted by the anatomical location. In the subcutis, lipomalike liposarcomas are often cured with local excision. Lipomalike liposarcomas rarely recur, and they do not metastasize. Use of the term atypical lipomatous tumor, a less serious designation for atypical lipoma, has been suggested.
Round-cell and poorly differentiated types have a poor prognosis. Each has a 5-year survival rate of about 50% because they recur locally and tend to metastasize quickly and widely. The lungs are particularly affected.
Despite high-grade morphology, cutaneous liposarcomas have a favorable clinical prognosis.
