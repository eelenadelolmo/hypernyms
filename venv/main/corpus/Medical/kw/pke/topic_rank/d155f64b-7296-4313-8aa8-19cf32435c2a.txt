Absent pedicle is a rare congential malformation which may affect any spinal segment.  The anomaly results in an apparently enlarged neuroforamen.  It is commonly associated with scoliosis.  The lateral mass on the ipsilateral side is usually malformed and posteriorly displaced, typically lying behind instead anterior to the laminar arch as in this case
