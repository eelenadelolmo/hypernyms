Patient with limps into exam room.  Active and passive motion of foot reproduce patient's symptoms.
The patient will be placed on non-weightbearing restrictions for a sufficient amount of time to allow proper healing.
Positive activity on inital blood flow and pool images in the right midfoot.  Delayed imaging demonstrates focal uptake in the region of the metatarsals.  These findings are confirmed with the presence of extensive periostal reaction/callous formation on the right third metatarsal on correlative plain films.
Metatarsal stress fracture
Stress fracture
If only bone scans were present and history was unknown, then both infection and neoplasm must be entertained.
