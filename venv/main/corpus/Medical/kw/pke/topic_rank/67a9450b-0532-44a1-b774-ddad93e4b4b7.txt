Aortic valve replacement
Axial CT without contrast: dilated aortic root, pectus excavatum

Frontal chest radiograph, postoperative: enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette and an artificial aortic valve.  Note elongated thorax typical of Marfan's patients.
Marfan's syndrome resulting in aortic root dilation
Without knowing the history, a differential for this finding would include aortitis, congenital variant, and idiopathic cystic medial necrosis (cystic medial necrosis is the underlying pathology in Marfan's, but there is also an idiopathic form).  There is no evidence of trauma, atherosclerosis, or inflammation to suggest mycotic aneurysm.
