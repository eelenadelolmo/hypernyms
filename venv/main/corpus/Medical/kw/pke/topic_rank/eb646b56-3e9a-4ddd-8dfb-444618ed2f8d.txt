CXR (not shown): Normal
CT:  Noncontrast CT demonstrates a 5.4cm hypodense mass in the left atrium with scattered marginal calcifications.  Mild heterogeneous enhancement is seen post-contrast.  The point of attachment is not clearly seen.
Atrial myxoma
Atrial myxoma, thrombus, sarcoma, papillary fibroelastoma
64yo woman presents for evaluation for new-onset atrial flutter.
Thrombi wonâ€™t enhance, are often seen in areas of aneurysmal dilation, and usually arise from the posterior and lateral atrial walls.  Enhancement can help differentiate thrombus from neoplasm.  Sarcomas usually invade adjacent structures and demonstrate pericardial involvement and metastases.  Papillary fibroelastomas are usually found on the mitral or aortic valves, and tend to be much smaller in size than myxomas.
