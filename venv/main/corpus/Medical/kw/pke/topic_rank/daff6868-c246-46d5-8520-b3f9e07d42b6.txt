4 y/o boy with chronic right hip pain with which is progressively worsening.
With the diagnosis of Legg-Calve-Perthes, approx. 15% can be bilateral.  This patient will then need follow-up not only of the affected side, to follow its progress and remodeling, but to assess the opposite side for any evidence of involvement.  This patient will also have an increased risk of early osteoarthritis secondary to the altered mechanics in the affected hip.
