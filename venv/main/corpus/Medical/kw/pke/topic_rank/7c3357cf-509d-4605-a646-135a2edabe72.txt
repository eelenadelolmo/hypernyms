N/C
Multiple MR sequences of the neck demonstrate a lobulated mass at the prior surgical site with intermediate T1 signal, high T2 signal, and enhancement.  Is this recurrence or changes induced by surgery and/or radiation?

Coregistered SPECT/CT images after the administration of In-111-octreotide demonstrates a focus of increased radiotracer uptake at the left neck corresponding to the area in question demonstrated on MR.  This is a recurrence of patient's known paraganglioma.
