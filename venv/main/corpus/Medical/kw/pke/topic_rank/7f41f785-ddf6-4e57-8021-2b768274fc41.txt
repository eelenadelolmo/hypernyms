There is mild diffuse swelling about the left ankle and point tenderness to palpation over the base of the left fifth metatarsal bone.
Placement of a short-leg weight-bearing cast for 6 weeks.
AP, oblique and lateral views of the left foot demonstrate a subtle transverse fracture lucency through the base of the fifth metatarsal at a distance of approximately 5 mm from the tip of the tuberosity.  Note that the transverse fracture line is extra-articular and just proximal to the level of the metatarsocuboid joint.  There is mild adjacent soft tissue swelling.
