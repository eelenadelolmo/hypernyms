EXAM: (Pertinent positives)
THYROID - Diffusely enlarged with no palpable nodules. + bruit.

LAB:
TSH: <0.02 uIU/ml
Free T4: 124 pmol/l

24 HR RAIU: 58.0%
Tc-99m Thyroid Scintigraphy: Planar and pinhole images of the neck from the anterior and anterior oblique projections demonstrate a regularly-contoured thyroid gland with increased diffuse homogeneous trapping throughout.
GRAVES DISEASE
1) Hashitoxicosis (although the thyroid images would typically demonstrate less homogeneity in tracer accumulation)
2) Hydatiform mole, Choriocarcinoma (although a specific assay for TSH would reveal suppression of TSH).

-The scintigraphy, combined with the RAIU and TFT's results in a very narrow DDx
9 month history of tremors and palpitations.
