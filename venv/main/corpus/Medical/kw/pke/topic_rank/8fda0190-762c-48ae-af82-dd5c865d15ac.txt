The patient was asymptomatic with no other abnormalities identified. No further work-up was recommended.
A contrast enhanced CT images of the chest demonstrated an enlarged azygous arch and absence of the intrahepatic segment of the right IVC.  Contrast from the power injection refluxed into the azygous arch. An enlarged hemiazygous vein is clearly seen crossing the midline anterior to the aorta, at the level of the diaphragm.
Interrupted Left IVC with hemiazygous and azygous continuation.
Interrupted Left IVC with hemiazygous and azygous continuation.
A 16 year old female, with no significant past medical history, was referred for a CT of the chest.  A chest radiograph obtained at another institution for unclear reasons was reported as having findings consistent with a left paraspinal mass.
Editors note:
Although no further workup was recommended for this patient, this anomaly is often associated with left atrial isomerism and other situs abnormalities, such as polyspleenia.  These patients need to be evaluated for cardiac and great vessel abnormalities, intracardiac shunting and arrythmias.  Although the images provided for review show no other abnormalities, a thorough imaging work up to detect situs abnormalities, included an echocardiogram, should have been performed.  The bronchi, pulmonary arteries, and pulmonary veins should have been discussed in detail in the CT report.  An EKG should have been performed.

Most importantly, the history of why a CXR was ordered for this patient should have been obtained.
