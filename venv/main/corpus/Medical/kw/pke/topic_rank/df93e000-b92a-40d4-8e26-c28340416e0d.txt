The patient had a history of a right frozen shoulder in the past.  She now presents with similar symptoms on the left.
This patient has significant joint capsule enhancement consistent with adhesive capsulitis.  Additionally, she has significant hypertrophy of the middle glenohumeral ligament.  This additional finding is not one of the common MR findings reported in the literature for adhesive capsulitis.  Women, as in this case, are more predisposed to this condition.
