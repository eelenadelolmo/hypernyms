Treatment of intralobar sequestration is often surgical and consists of segmentectomy and sometimes even full lobectomy when chronic infection has obliterated segmental planes.  Some authors have also supported conservative nonsurgical management; however, resection following antibiotic treatment is often recommended to avoid reinfection and potential bleeding complications.
An accessory artery originates just superior to the celiac trunk which terminates in the medial basal segment of the right lower lobe.  No airspace opacity is seen within the right lower lobe.  Pulmonary veins within the region empty into the left atrium.

The patient was asymptomatic from a pulmonary standpoint.  A lung nodule was incidentally found on a shoulder radiograph which prompted a CT exam demonstrating an anomalous vessel within the right lung base.
This is a very unusual case of an intralobar sequestration in which it manifests only as a subtle tubular area of opacity within the right lower lobe.  The tubular opacity represents a systemic feeding artery off of the abdominal aorta just above the celiac axis.  Intralobar sequestrations typically present as a homogenous consolidation with irregular margins or as a uniformly dense mass with smooth or lobulated contours in the posterior basal segment of the lower lobe (most often the left lower lobe).  Bronchiectasis, atelectasis, decreased lung volume, mediastinal shift, and prominence of the pulmonary hilum are other associated radiographic findings which are not apparent in this case.  Pleural effusions are rarely present occurring in less than 4% of cases. After antibiotic treatment, the radiographic abnormality may diminish or alter significantly. A multicystic lesion may remain.  An even more unusual presentation may be the appearance of localized emphysema without an associated consolidation or mass.  A cavitary intralobar sequestration can mimic a lung abscess, pneumonia, neoplasm, empyema, bronchogenic cyst, pericardial cyst, eventration of the diaphragm, and congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation.  The feeding arterial vessel in this case originates from the abdominal aorta just above the celiac axis.  This occurs in 20% of cases.  More commonly in 73% of cases, the feeding vessel arises from the thoracic aorta.  In 95% of cases, the venous drainage from the intralobar sequestration occurs through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium.  The remaining 5% of intralobar sequestrations drain into the systemic circulation through the azygos, hemiazygos, intercostal veins, or superior vena cava into the right atrium.  In even rarer cases, the venous blood drains into a branch of the pulmonary artery.  Some intralobar sequestrations are congenital; however, most cases represent a focal chronic inflammatory process that ultimately draws normally occurring aortic branches within the pulmonary ligament to feed the sequestered lung tissue.   Intralobar sequestrations account for 75% of all pulmonary sequestrations.  Extralobar sequestrations constitute 25% of all pulmonary sequestrations.  Extralobar sequestrations consist of a discrete, accessory lobe of nonaerated lung tissue that has its own pleural envelope.  Extralobar sequestrations are a congenital anomaly in which the venous drainage is systemic in 80% of cases draining into the azygos vein, hemiazygos vein, or superior vena cava before entering the right atrium.
