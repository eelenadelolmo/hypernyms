Intracranial Hypotension
• Leptomeningeal Tumor spread

29 year old previously healthy woman picked up her young child and immediately developed a severe headache.  Her headache was completely relieved in the supine position.
Her CSF opening pressure was zero.  The contrast spontaneously filled all three spinal spaces.

Further review of her history reveals that she has a two year old child.  At the time of delivery for that child, an epidural catheter was placed.  I speculate that the dura was torn at that time and  the CSF leaked into  the spinal subdural space.  The dural tear probably healed and then reopened last week when she picked up the child.
