Tubular Ectasia
Tubular ectasia of the rete testis 
Cystic neoplasm
73 year old male with orchalgia.
Tubular ectasia of the rete testis is believed to be caused by some degree of obstruction of the seminiferous tubules.  This condition is frequently associated with testicular cysts and spermatoceles.  This condition is also more commonely seen in patients that have had inguinal surgery.  The key to making the distinction between tubular ectasia versus a cystic neoplasm is to recognize the elongated shape on long axis views and noting bilaterality when present.
