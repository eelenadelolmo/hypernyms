This patient subsequently underwent ballon dilations of the lower esophageal sphinter.
Frontal chest radiograph demonstrated a wideneded mediastinum on the right side, which on the lateral chest radiograph was a mass within the middle mediastinum superiorly and crossed into the posterior mediastinum inferiorly.
