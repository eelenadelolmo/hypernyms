Nasal cavities were normal.
There was no tenderness over frontal, maxillary or ethmoidal sinuses. 
Ophthalmic examination was normal.
Patient was a diabetic, her blood sugar was within normal limits.  All other blood investigations were normal.
Patient underwent endoscopic sinus surgery.  The sphenoid sinus was opened using endoscopic guidance.  Secretions from the sinus drained.  The normal sphenoid ostium was widened to prevent further recurrence.
• Axial CT plain showed expansile lesion involving the sphenoid sinus.  There was also evidence of the lesion involving the posterior ethmoid air cells.

• Contrast CT (axial) showed a non enhancing expansile mass involving the sphenoid sinus.

• MRI T1 weighted image showed an expansile mass with low signal intensity involving the sphenoid sinus.
Sphenoid mucocele
• Pituitary adenoma
• Craniopharyngioma
• Meningioma
50 years old woman with complaints of intractable headache - 3 years duration.  Headache was mostly confined to the occipital region.  She also gave h/o intermittent blurred vision 
She gave no h/o seizures, nasal block.
Sphenoidal mucocele is a rare entity.  Mucoceles commonly involve frontal and ethmoidal sinuses.  Mucoceles are caused by obstruction to the drainage of the sinus cavity.  This causes secretions from the sinus to accumulate within the cavity.  On top of it the lining epithelium of the sinus keeps secreting.  This causes expansion of the sinus cavity due to a process of bone remodeling.  There may also be associated bone erosion.

CT scan is virtually diagnostic in these patients.  MRI imaging will help in the study of interface between the mucocele and intracranial structures.
