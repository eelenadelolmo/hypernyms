Bruise on left ankle.  No cranial nerve deficits or other neurological deficits.
1.	No treatment if no symptoms.  Can follow up over time.
2.	If symptomatic, stereotactic radiosurgery or surgery depending on individual cases.
1.	Outside head CT reported small 1cm homogenously round hyperdense lesion in left frontal lobe as an intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH).
2.	Head CT in our hospital 5 hours later: stable 1 cm homogenously round hyperdense lesion,   suspicious for cavernoma, suggest MRI for confirmation.
      3. Brain MRI later shows classic “popcorn” appearance on T2-weighted image with low T2 signal in the periphery of the lesion consistent with  cavernoma. In addition, small deep frontal vessels, draining towards the left ventricle, are noted on the post-contrast T1W image, consistent with a developmental venous anomaly (DVA).
Left frontal cavernous malformation with DVA.
1.	IPH (intra-parenchymal hemorrhage)
2.	Other vascular lesions such as AVM, AVF, or aneurysm.
3.	Hypercellular neoplasm, either primary or metastatic.
76 y.o. woman who fell; LOC; no trauma to head; twisted ankle
Cavernomas are often associated with DVAs. Limited role of CT due to lack of specificity. MRI including T2 and GRE sequences are preferred.
