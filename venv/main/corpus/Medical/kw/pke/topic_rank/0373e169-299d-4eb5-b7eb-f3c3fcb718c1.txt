Patient was found to have right eye myopia and normal eye pressures bilaterally. Dilated funduscopic exam of the right eye revealed a large disc excavation with peripheral pigmentation around the disc, but there was no retinal detachment. The left eye showed normal disc size and structure and normal vessels.
1) Coronal T2 weight images demonstrates the right globe shows a slight bulge along the posterolateral aspect and is not entirely rounded consistent with optic nerve staphyloma.
2) Axial T1 Flair shows that the right optic nerve is smaller than the left optic nerve in the posterior orbit. However, the right optic nerve shows enlargement extending to the anterior optic disc. The area of enlargement is nearly 1 cm in length consistent with typical size of optic disc excavation with a staphyloma.
3) Sagittal T1 Flair shows an incidental pars intermedia cyst, measuring 4 mm vertically x 2 millimeters AP.

1) Optic nerve staphyloma
2) Morning glory syndrome
3) Optic disc coloboma
