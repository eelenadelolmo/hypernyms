Decreased O2 saturation, elevated CRP.
Current CXR's are provided - as well as images from five months PTA
The patient did have a + lupus anti-coagulant on laboratory work-up.  She progressed well and was discharged on anti-coagulation.
CXR:  Prominent bilateral hila when compared with prior 

CXR 5 months prior.  Peripheral tapering of pulmonary vasculature.  New airspace opacification superior segment left lower lobe seen best on lateral view.

CT PE/DVT:  Large clot burden involving majority of pulmonary arteries bilaterally.  Small focus of consolidation posteromedially left upper lobe likely correlating with CXR findings.  Expansion of right popliteal vein with central low attenuation representing thrombus.
Pulmonary Embolism
37 y/o woman presents with tachycardia, shortness of breath, and chest pain
The new airspace opacity posteriorly on the CXR as well on the CT suggests a Hampton's Hump (wedge shaped peripheral opacity with base abutting pleura representing pulmonary infarct)

The enlarged hila with tapering of the peripheral vasculature, particulary in the lower lobes, suggests Westermark's sign. (an area of focal oligemia secondary to occlusive thrombus)
