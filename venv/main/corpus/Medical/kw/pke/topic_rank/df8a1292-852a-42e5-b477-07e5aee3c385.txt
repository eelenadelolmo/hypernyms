The frontal view of the shoulder reveals an obliquely-oriented radiolucent defect in the acromion process at its junction with the scapular spine. There is an irregularly-shaped, 4 x 12mm opacity at the inferior aspect of the glenoid process, suggesting a bony fragment. The other bony structures appear grossly intact. The axillary lateral view confirms an oblique fracture through both cortices of the proximal aspect of the acromion process. The fracture appears non-displaced and without angular deformity. Also confirmed is the avulsed fragment of the inferior glenoid process. There is no abnormal separation of the acromioclavicular joint.
Fractured Acromion Process (right scapula), Bankart Fracture of Inferior Glenoid Process
51yo African American male was involved in a motor vehicle accident. He presents with right shoulder pain and limited range of motion.
Fractures of the scapula usually result from direct blows to the shoulder, and not from forces directed through the upper arm. They may rarely occur in association with a superior dislocation of the glenohumerol joint. Scapular fractures are commonly associated with other major injuries. These include fractures of the clavicle, ribs and skull; concussions; brachial plexus injuries; and pneumothorax.
	Fractures of the acromion process are relatively rare. Fractures of the body of the scapula comprise the majority of scapular fractures, with glenoid fractures second most common. In Findlay's series, acromion fractures accounted for only 10.8% of scapular fractures. They most commonly occur at the junction of the acromion with the spine of the scapula, with a transverse orientation of the fracture site.
	It is important not to confuse the os acromiale, the secondary ossification center which may persist in adulthood, as a fracture. This makes up the anterior tip of the acromion process and when persistent may be recognized by identifying two cortical bone surfaces at the interface.
	Treatment of acromion fractures usually involves placement of the patient in a shoulder immobilizer, with proximal traction at the elbow and downward pressure over the lateral clavicle. Union typically results after 3-4 weeks. These fractures occasionally require open reduction with internal fixation to prevent both the impingement syndrome at the subacromial space and the disruption of the acromioclavicular joint.
