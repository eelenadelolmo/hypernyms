Conservative therapies can be used for treatment or  surgical ACL reconstruction. The patient's activity level is the most important factor guiding the choice of treatment. Associated meniscal and ligamentous injuries, the degree of laxity, and the patient's age and willingness to pursue vigorous postoperative physical therapy are major factors in determining which treatment option to pursue.
MRI images show complete disruption of the anterior cruciate ligament.  Bony edema and contusions are present along the lateral femoral condyle and lateral proximal tibial plateau.
ACL injury
Three grades of ACL tears
Grade I: intraligamentous injury without a change in ligament length.
Grade II:  intraligamentous injury with an increase in ligament length
Greade III: complete ligamentous disruption
The patient is a soccer player who injured her knee while pivoting.
The primary signs of an ACL tear include nonvisualization, disruption of the substance of the ACL by abnormal increased signal intensity, abrupt angulation or a wavy appearance, and an abnormal ACL axis. The axis of the ACL is abnormal if it is clearly more horizontal than a line projected along the intercondylar roof (Blumensaat line) on the sagittal images.  This patient has all the primary signs of an ACL tear.

Secondary signs of an ACL tear include:
1.  Posterolateral tibial plateau and lateral femoral condyle subchondral bone bruises.
2.  The deep lateral femoral-notch sign that manifests as an exaggerated (>1.5 mm-deep) notch of the lateral femoral condyle on lateral plain radiographs. 
3.  Contrecoup bone bruises that involve the posteromedial tibial plateau.  When a contrecoup bone bruise is present, the incidence of a meniscal tear is high.  
4.  Anterior tibial displacement.  This occurs when the distance between vertical lines through the posterior margins of the femur and tibia exceed 5 mm.  
5.  A tibial spine fracture.
6.  A Segond fracture (an elliptical, vertical, fragment paralleling the lateral tibial cortex about 4 mm distal to the plateau).
7.  Buckling or redundancy of the PCL.
8.  Edema in the region of the ACL.
9.  Avulsion fracture of the proximal fibula (termed the arcuate sign).
10. The presence of a concomitant PCL tear.
11.  Kissing contusions.
12.  Uncovered posterior horn of the lateral meniscus.
