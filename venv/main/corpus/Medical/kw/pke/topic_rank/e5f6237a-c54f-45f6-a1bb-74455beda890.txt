Vitals: Temp- 36.9 C, HR 62, SpO2 95% on room air
General: Patient is seated comfortably and is in no acute distress. 
Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. 
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. S1 and S2 are normal without any murmurs, rubs or gallops. 
Musculoskeletal: On inspection, the inferopatellar regions of both medial and lateral aspects of the right knee demonstrated swelling. Popliteal fluid is noted in the posterior aspect of the left knee. Active flexion of the left knee is 115 degrees and right knee is 75 degrees. Apley"s compression and distraction procedures were negative for the left knee. There was increase in pain in the right knee with these two procedures. Valgus and varus testing for both the right and left knee were unremarkable. The Lachman"s procedure and AP drawer procedures were negative bilaterally. The McMurray"s procedure was negative for the left knee.  Such was positive for the right knee with locking of the right knee during external rotation of the hip, increased pain and an inability to extend the knee further. Patellar grind procedure was negative bilaterally. 
Extremities: Dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial, popliteal and ilio-femoral pulses are 2+ bilaterally. A monofilament test using 2.83mm filament showed normal sensation in both feet.
Treatment of the OCD lesions is dependent on the stage of the disease. Based on the radiological findings, the lesion in the right knee of this patient is considered a stage IV lesion. Stage IV lesions are known to be unstable and can cause joint erosion if not treated surgically. Surgical treatment can include open drilling and internal fixation of the loose fragment.
Radiographs 10 months post MVA - AP and lateral views of the right knee shows mild osteoarthritis with a rounded calcification in the anterior knee joint. 

MRI of the knee performed 9 months post MVA - Axial, sagittal and coronal images of the right knee using MRI reveals: 1)Non-displaced radial tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus 2)A scant knee joint effusion 3)Well-circumscribed disc body anteriorly within the joint space measuring 1.6cm in greatest diameter.

Patient is a 54 year old AA woman who presents to the office for evaluation of pain in her right knee. She reports that she was involved in a motor vehicle accident. During the accident, she notes that the anteromedial aspect of her right knee struck the steering column. She reports having no pain or discomfort in the right knee prior to that accident. Since then however she has had 6/10 pain and discomfort in the right knee with a feeling of the knee giving away. Pain is worse at the end of the day. She also notes that the discomfort in her knees has also resulted her to limp on her right side when she walks. She wears a brace for her right knee that helps stabilize the knee. She also reports loss of range of motion in the right knee which she describes as a locking of the knee during flexion. If she were to climb stairs, she notes that she has to do it sideways to avoid giving away of her right knee. While grocery shopping, she  reports that she supports herself using a grocery cart in case her right knee were to give away. She reports that when she turns, she has to lift her right foot rather than spin during the turn due to pain and discomfort in her right knee. She also uses a cane to ambulate. 
Modified from Noyes FR.  Subjective Knee Score Questionnaire from: Sports Medicine 1984: J:286-287.   Such revealed a score of 19/100.

Based on the imaging and clinical symptoms, it can be concluded that the lesion in the joint space is from OCD. However, the temporal relationship of the lesion to the trauma patient suffered in the MVA is unclear.  OCD is usually a progressive disease that is believed to develop from repetitive trauma.   In this case we have a single traumatic event but where imaging evidence is 9-10 months post MVA.  Stage 4 OCD arises from a subchondral fracture, interruption of the blood supply, chronic ischemia, necrosis and the resultant fragment displacing into the joint space.  It is unclear whether this single traumatic MVA accident could have caused this scenario to arise.  Could such episode have been the initial macro trauma? Could day to day activity post MVA over the 9-10 month period of time have been the repetitive microtrauma commonly thought to accompany OCD, progressing the lesion to  stage 4?  It is also possible that the trauma from the MVA resulted in progression of an already existing lower stage OCD lesion to progress to a stage IV lesion.  The symptoms that the patient describes of giving way and instability of the knee are consistent with a meniscal tear and where the tear can be ascertained with reasonable medical correlative certainty to be the result of the MVA.  She is being recommended  for orthopedic surgical intervention for both of these conditions at the time of this publication.
