Diffuse bowel gas pattern, thickened bowel wall, consistent with previous diagnosis of NEC

PICC line in LUE with tip terminating on left side of mediastinum
LUE PICC with tip in descending aorta
PICC line misplacement - arterial catherization
Aberrant anatomy (i.e. persistent left SVC emptying into left atrium)
Infant female day of life 43, currently in NICU s/p delivery at gestation age of 26week three days.
