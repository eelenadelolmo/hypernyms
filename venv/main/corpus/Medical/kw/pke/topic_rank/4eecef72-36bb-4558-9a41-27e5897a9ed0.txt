A Swan-Ganz catheter (placed via the left internal jugular vein) looped in the SVC and coursing into an anomalously draining left upper lobe pulmonary vein.
This indicates that the left superior pulmonary vein drains into the left  brachiocephalic vein.

Venous catheters may demonstrate unusual venous drainage (eg. left-sided SVC).  Knowledge of venous drainage anomalies is important for an ICU physician when reviewing the line placement.  PAPVR is in the spectrum of left-to-right shunts (with ASD, VSD, and PDA), but occurs at the level of the pulmonary veins.   When left-to-right shunts are large, patients can present with with shortness of breath and pulmonary hypertension.
