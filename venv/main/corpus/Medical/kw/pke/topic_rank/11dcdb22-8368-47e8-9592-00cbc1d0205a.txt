There is a approximate 1 cm well circumscribed rounded mass in the left upper lobe on the chest x-ray. There is faint increased density centrally which could represent calcification.
On CT, there is a 1.2 cm well defined mass within the anterior aspect of the left upper lobe. There are macroscopic regions of fat as well as calcifications centrally, most consistent with a pulmonary hamartoma.
