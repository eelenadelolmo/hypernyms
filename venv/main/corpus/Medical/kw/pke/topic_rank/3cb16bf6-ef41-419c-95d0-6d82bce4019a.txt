-On initial evaluation, no evident pneumothorax (PTX) nor displaced fracture
-On close examination, subtle increased visualization of the right heart border with associated relative regional lucency

• Trauma Scan - CT
-Anterior pneumothorax comprising approximately 25% of right thorax
-Patchy foci of lung density representing lung contusion
-Representative non-displaced rib fracture

• Initial Upright CXR
-PTX is now in the typical location laterally and superiorly

• Second Upright CXR
-Following minimal change after 24 hours, thoracostomy tube inserted
