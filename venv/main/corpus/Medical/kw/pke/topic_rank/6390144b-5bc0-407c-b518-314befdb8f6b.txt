Patient with stage IV Non-Hodgkins lymphoma with right triceps muscle and bilateral lower extremity weakness along with bilateral hand paresthesias.  Also noted to have a recent "decline in mental status" all following intrathecal administration of methotrexate.
The temporal relationship between the methotrexate administration and onset of symptoms with MR changes and normal CSF fluid analysis suggests that methotrexate is the culprit.  However, the patient does have a white count and viral serologies are pending.  The areas of enhancement are likely part of the same process given the pericatheter location of most of the foci.  Some of the foci, however, may be new foci of NHL.
