The evaluation of a complex cystic ovarian mass can be difficult.  Features such as wall thickness, inner wall structure, septations and echogenicity are assessed in an attempt to sonographically separate benign from malignant lesions.  Lesions with thin walls (<3mm), smooth inner wall structure, no septations and an anechoic center are almost certainly benign.  More characteristically aggressive lesions are mostly solid, have papillary projections, thick septations and are hyperechoic.  Although the lesion in question has a more benign- appearing structure, the decision was made to proceed to biopsy.  Often, a lesion suspicious for a hemorrhagic cyst may be followed with a repeat US in 6-8 weeks to confirm resolution of this rapidly evolving entity.
