Lateral C-spine film. Note the posterior displacement of the cervical spine in relation to the skull.
Atlanto-occipital dislocation
9 year old girl injured in motor vehicle accident.
The distance between the anterior arch of C1 to the post foramen magnum (AO) and the distance between the anterior foramen magnum and the spinolaminar line (BC) are compared. Normally, the BC/OA ratio should be less than 1.0.

AO dislocation is often not compatible with life, but rarely these patients may survive - depending on the extent of associated injury to the spinal cord and medulla.
