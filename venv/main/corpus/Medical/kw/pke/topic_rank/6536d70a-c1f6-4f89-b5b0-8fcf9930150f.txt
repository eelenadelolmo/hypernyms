Pulmonary LAM is a rare lung disease affecting women of reproductive age.  The main feature of the disease is proliferation of pulmonary interstitial smooth muscle cells.  Patients typically present with dyspnea, and may also have cough and chest pain.  Median survival is 8 to 10 years from diagnosis although patients may benefit from hormonal therapy, oophorectomy, and lung transplantation.  Complications of LAM include spontaneous pneumothorax, chylothorax, chyloperitoneum, chyluria, renal angiomyolipomas, hemoptysis, and meningioma.
