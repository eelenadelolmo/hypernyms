Selective external carotid catheter angiogram shows:

24 y.o. man, after heavy alcohol intake, fell from a barstool, striking his head on the floor.  He was only unconscious for one minute - but awoke amnestic for the event.
Before we had CT and MR - non-invasive imaging - intracranial mass lesions were identified, localized, and often diagnosed using invasive methods, such as the angiogram used for this patient.  The displacement of the meningeal arteries nicely demonstrates the classic "bi-convex" shape of an epidural hematoma - as well as showing the bleeding meningeal artery.
