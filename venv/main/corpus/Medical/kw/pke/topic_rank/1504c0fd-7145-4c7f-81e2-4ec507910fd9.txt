On exam the patient was found to have a palpable mass within the penis of approx 5cm x 1cm within the glans and shaft of the penis.  The prostate was smooth and uniformed enlarged without nodules.  
    Urinalysis and Urine Culture was negative, and cystoscopy revealed an abnormal and irregular stricture within the distal urethra.
This patient underwent partial penectomy, during which invasion into the corpus spongiosum was confirmed, staging the patient as T2N0M0.  He remained in stable condition during his hospital stay, and thus he was discharged on post-op day 2.
On these T1 weighted post gad MRI images an irregular mass of approx 5cm x 1.5 cm is visible within the corpus spongiosum.  The mass appears of intermediate signal intensity and is heterogeneous in composition.  There is no definitive invasion into the corpora cavernosa but the mass has indistinct margins and is poorly circumscribed.  No lymphadenopathy is seen.
