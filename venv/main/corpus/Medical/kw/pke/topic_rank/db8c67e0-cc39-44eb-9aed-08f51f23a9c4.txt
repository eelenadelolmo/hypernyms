This patient has numerous risk factors for PE.  She has a history of 4 spontaneous first trimester abortions.  She presents with unilateral chest pain that is sometimes positional, recent train ride, and lupus-like symptoms.  Dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain are found in 73 and 44 percent of those with PEs per PIOPED II study.  

CXR is not typically diagnostic because atelectasis and effusion are present in those without PEs as well.  

Gold standard is pulmonary angiography, but V/Q scan and CT remain more common today.  CT scan may show alternative diagnosis in 57% (PIOPED), but a clearly visible occlusion is present.

Patient is currently undergoing workup for hypercoagulable state.
