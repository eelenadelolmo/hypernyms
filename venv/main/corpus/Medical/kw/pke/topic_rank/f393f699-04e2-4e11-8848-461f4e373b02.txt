A fat/fluid level and subtle depression in the medial plateau.
Tibial Plateau Fracture
Fat/fluid level is indicative of an intraarticular fracture.
1. tibial plateau fracture
2. fracture of distal femur (medial & lateral condyles)
3. fracture of patella
Acute knee injury while playing basketball.
Fat-fluid levels in the knee are typically detected on cross-table lateral views of the knee because the beam must be parallel to the fluid-fat interface. The beam was fortuitously parallel to this interface on the sunrise view thus replicating the physics of the cross-table lateral view of the knee.
