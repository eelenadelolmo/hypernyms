There are 2 seperate horns to the fundal region of the uterus with a indentation or concave appearance to the contour of the fundus that has bowel and omental fat sitting in the concavity.  The 2 horns are seen to fuse to a single endometrial cavity at the body region of the uterus.
Bicornuate Uterus
Bicornuate uterus
Septate uterus
52 y/o female G1P1 w/ h/o vaginal bleeding and pain x 3 months
The differentiation of bicornuate from septate uterus involves identification of a difference in the contour of the fundus.   The septate uterus should have a convex margin superiorly as apposed to the bicornuate which is concave.  The clinical implication is that if a surgical repair is planned for fertility reasons, a septum is able to be removed hysteroscopically whereas the bicornuate uterus is repaired via an abdominal approach.  Imagine the suprise of the gynecologist performing a "septectomy" hysteroscopically and having bowel loops headed toward the scope camera.  The perforation would result in the procedure being converted to an abdominal repair.
