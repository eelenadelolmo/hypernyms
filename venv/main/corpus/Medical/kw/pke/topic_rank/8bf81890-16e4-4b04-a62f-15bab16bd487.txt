PHYSICAL EXAM:	There was a 8cm x 3.5cm lesion on the temperoparietal scalp. Centrally within the lesion were areas of alopecia and five firm, mobile 0.5-2cm subcutaneous nodules and several well healed biopsy sites. No bruits were appreciated on auscultation. 
Laboratory: Bone scan and cerebral angiography were normal. MRI revealed an enhancing lesion in the deep soft tissues of the scalp covering a 9cm x 9cm area overlying the left parietal and frontal bones, superficial to the temporalis muscle, with no evidence of bony involvement. 
HISTOPATHOLOGY: Proliferations of nevomelanocytes, dendritic and spindled cells, and Schwann cells extending from the lower dermis through the subcutaneous fat to the galea.
Surgical excision of the entire lesion
