2 chest tubes and JP in left chest wall. Subacute air felt along L chest wall
See Discussion.
Two left sided pleural drainage tubes and a left lower chest wall surgical drain. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema involving the entire extent of the visualized soft tissues of the chest, axilla, and supraclavicular neck. The right lung is clear. There is increased air spce opacification at the left base. the entire cardiac silhouette except for the aortic arch is obscured. Numerous left sided posterior rib fractures which existed preoperatively.
Subcutaneous emphysema
81 yr old white male with 2 cm LLL nodule found sixth months ago on CT suspicious for early malignancy. Now status post LLL lobectomy. 80 pack-year smoking history.
Subcutaneous Emphysema refers to the presence of air in the subcutaneous tissue and muscle.  This can occur secondary to Pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous tissue necrosis by gas forming organisms, or air leaks inadvertently diverted by chest tubes. Mechanisms for chest tube induced subcutaneous emphysema include prolonged drainage, poor tube placement, tube blockage, side port migration and a greater number of chest tubes. 
  Air in subcutaneous tissue can spread in all directions but is more commonly involves upper parts of the body rather than lower. The emphysema often produces a smooth and swollen appearance of the skin which is associated with crepitus upon palpation. On imaging studies the air may interdigitate with muscle bundles to produce a characteristic  streaky linear pattern, especially with the pectoralis muscles over the chest. When these streaky linear densities become wide spread over the anterior or posterior chest walls, subcutaneous emphysema can obscure underlying lung pathology.  Treatment is to remove the cause (such as removing or repositioning a chest tube).  The air can resolve in a matter of days, however, a 2001 study by PM Jones et al demonstrated that patients with subcutaneous emphysema induced by chest tubes had longer hospital stays and increased mortality.
