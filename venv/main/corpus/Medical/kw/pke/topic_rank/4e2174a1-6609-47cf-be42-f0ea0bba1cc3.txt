-exacerbation of pain while standing on the affected leg
Because the patient did not improve with rest and given the extent of involvement on MR (>50% of the diameter of the femoral neck affected) internal fixation was used.  The patient's symptoms resolved after a few weeks.
Although the initial radiographs were negative repeat examination showed a linear sclerotic area at the infero-medial border of the femoral neck.
Stress Fracture
The linear nature of the sclerosis virtually ensures the diagnosis of fracture. Stress fractures can be be confused with neoplasm or infection but these processes tend to be ovoid or round.
