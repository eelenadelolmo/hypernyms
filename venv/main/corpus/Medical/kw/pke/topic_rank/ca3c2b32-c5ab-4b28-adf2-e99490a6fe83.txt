UGI series demonstrates a smoothly bordered submucosal mass at the gastroesophageal junction (note the obtuse angles formed at the border of the mass and the esophageal wall)
CT demonstrates a soft tissue density mass at the gastroesophageal junction.  It appears slightly eccentric in location, corresponding well with UGI.

When leiomyomas grow exophytically into the mediastinum, they can sometimes be recognized on chest radiographs by the presence of a mediastinal mass. Rarely, these tumors may contain punctate areas of calcification. Leiomyomas usually appear on barium studies as discrete, smooth-surfaced submucosal masses that form right angles or slightly obtuse angles with the adjacent esophageal wall when viewed in profile. 
 
These lesions may therefore be indistinguishable from other mesenchymal tumors except that leiomyomas are more likely on empirical grounds. The lesions typically range from 2 to 8 cm in diameter but can occasionally be giant masses as large as 20 cm in size.  Leiomyomas typically appear on computed tomography (CT) as homogeneous soft tissue masses but differentiation from other benign or malignant esophageal tumors is difficult on the basis of the CT findings. Although the vast majority of esophageal leiomyomas occur as solitary submucosal masses, barium studies may occasionally reveal multiple submucosal masses or even annular lesions with varying degrees of obstruction.
