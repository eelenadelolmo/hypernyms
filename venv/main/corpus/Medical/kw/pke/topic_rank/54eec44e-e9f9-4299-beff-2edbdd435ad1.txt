Gross deformation of the right ankle, swelling, ecchymosis, instability and pain.
Patient was referred to orthopedic surgery for open reduction and repair.
There is an obliquely-oriented, comminuted fracture through the distal fibula, nondisplaced medial malleolar fracture, and obvious external rotation / disloctation of the talus with respect to the mortise.  A posterior tibia fracture is also suggested on the lateral view, although position is admittedly suboptimal.
