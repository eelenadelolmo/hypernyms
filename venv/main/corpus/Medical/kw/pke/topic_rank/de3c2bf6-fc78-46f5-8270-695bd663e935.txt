Given this patients history of surgery and subsequent ulcers, the stricure of the duodenum is likely secondary to the ulcers.  Ischemic stricture is also a possibility given the recent surgical manipulation.  Also, even though the appearance on CT isn't as consistent with adhesions, this would be high in the differential given that it is the most common cause of SBO in post-surgical patients.
