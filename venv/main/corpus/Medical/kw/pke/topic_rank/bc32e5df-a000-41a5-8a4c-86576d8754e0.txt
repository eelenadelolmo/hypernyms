Fig 1. Contrast enhanced axial MRI showing a partially cystic suprasellar mass.

Fig 2. Contrast enhanced coronal MRI showing the partially cystic suprasellar mass. 

Fig 3. Histological section of the resected tumor showing irregular expanses of squamous epithelium in which basal cells and stellate cells can be seen.  Also present are bands of eosinophilic fibrous tissue.

Fig 4. In other areas, there were large masses of “wet” keratin in which ill-defined remnants of nuclei can be seen.

This 70 year old man had progressive visual loss over 3 to 5 years. He denied headache, nausea or vomiting. Examination  revealed no light perception in either eye. The remainder of his cranial nerves were intact as were his motor and sensory examinations.
This is somewhate unusual, since the adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma is more common in childhood.  The adult squamous and papillary craniopharyngioma is usually a solid mass without calcification.
