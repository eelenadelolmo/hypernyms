No ophthalmopathy identified.  The right lobe of the thyroid is firm, smooth and 1.5X normal size.  The left lobe is notable for a 5-6 cm firm/hard mass with decreased mobility.  Heart rate 100 bpm.
Labs:  Total T4 >30; TSH <0.03; RAI @ 4 hours 37.9% (nl 5-15%)
A fine needle aspiration biopsy of the mass is planned after stabilization of thyroid function, followed by partial thyroidectomy if benign and total thyroidectomy if FNA findings are suspicious or confirm malignancy.
I-123 study shows homogenous uptake in the right lobe of the thyroid, with the left lobe displaced medially and a large photopenic defect at the midpole laterally.
Graves' Disease with large hypofunctional thyroid mass.
<li> Graves' Disease with Thyrotoxicosis and thyroid mass, concerning for malignancy
<li> Thyroiditis
<li> Plummer's disease
58 year old female found to have lump in neck on routine physical exam.  Patient was recently diagnosed with hypertension.  No family history of thyroid disease. Patient reports palpitations, anxiety, weakness, and occasional chest pressure with exertion.
The combination of laboratory values and appearance of the thyroid lead to the diagnosis of Graves' disease.  The hypofunctioning "cold" mass in this patient is concerning.  The incidence of thyroid cancer in solitary cold nodules ranges from 5-40%.  The relatively large size of this mass as well as the decreased mobility add concern in this case. If this proves to be thyroid cancer, it is known that the behavior of thyroid cancer in patients with Graves' disease is somewhat more aggressive. This is due to the stimulatory effects of the Graves' antibodies on the TSH receptors of functional thyroid cancer cells.
