Lateral Pharyngeal Diverticulum: AP single contrast esophagram reveals a small left sided outpouching arising from the hypopharynx (arrow).

Zenker diverticulum.  Lateral single-contrast esophagram reveals a outpouching arising from the region of the cricopharyngeus posterior to the normal esophagus.  AP single-contrast esophagram reveals a outpouching arising mid-line from the region proximal to the cricopharyngeus.

Epiphrenic Diverticulum: Double-contrast esophagram demonstrates a focal outpouching containing contrast materal proximal to the GE junction.  Esophageal contractions are also visible.

Gastric diverticulum: Double contrast UGI demonstrates a moderate sized pouch arising from the gastric fundus posteriorly. Its narrow neck arises near the GE junction. Folds extend from the stomach into the pouch.

Duodenal diverticulum:  Double contrast UGI reveals a outpouching arising from the second portion of the duodenum at the medial wall.
