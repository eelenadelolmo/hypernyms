Anxious girl complaining of upper abdominal pain
Our patient was diagnosed with trichotillomania.  Rarely, the bezoar can extend into the small bowel (sometimes all the way to the colon) and is known as the "Rapunzel syndrome."  

This interesting rare intestinal condition in humans results from eating hair. The syndrome is named after the long-haired girl Rapunzel in the fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. Trichophagia can be associated with the hair pulling disorder trichotillomania.
