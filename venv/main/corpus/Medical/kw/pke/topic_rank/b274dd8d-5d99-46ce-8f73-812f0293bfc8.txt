Texto: 
Patient not currently febrile, but was up until 5 days ago. She had been on a course of antibiotics until 2 days ago.
Patient is on long term prophylactic antibiotics.  She is over the age at which reflux should have spontaneously resolved and still has a rather severe case of reflux with  loss of renal function on the left side.  She will most likely need a surgical procedure to correct the problem before additional  long term effects occur.
Initial VCUG images demonstrate reflux of contrast into a massively dilated ureter and left renal pelvis.  There is significant dilation of the left renal pelvis and fornices.

Ultrasound also demonstrates hydronephrosis of the left kidney.

DMSA nucleide scan shows multiple foci with no uptake of radiotracer in the left kidney.  This most likely represents scarring from previous bouts with pyelonephritis.  Differential renal function is heavily in favor of the right side.
