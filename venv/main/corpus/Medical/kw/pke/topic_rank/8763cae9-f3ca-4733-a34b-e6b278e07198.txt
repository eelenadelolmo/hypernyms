HEENT: Bilateral hearing loss, AS>AD.
Neurologic: No other focal deficits or abnormal findings.
Rest of exam was noncontributory.
-None if asymptomatic
-Diuretic therapy
-Surgical drainage - Indicated when disability occurs due to compression or obstruction.  This can be done open or image-guided by CT or open MRI.  Outcomes are good, with concomitant risk of mild focal deficits and seizure disorders.
MRI for Internal Auditory Canal
1.  Incidentally noted anterior left temporal fossa arachnoid cyst. 
2.  No evidence of retrocochlear or temporal bone-based pathology.
3.  Sinusitis within both maxillary sinuses as well as fluid within the left mastoid air cells.
Arachnoid Cyst
Arachnoid cyst
Epidermoid cyst 
Dermoid cyst 
Parasitic cyst
Cystic glioma
Chronic Hematoma
27 year old man with bilateral hearing loss after surgical removal of a PE tube stuck behind his left TM.  He underwent an MRI of the internal auditory canals for further follow up.
Arachnoid cysts are histologically benign, intracranial fluid collections, usually congenital in origin.  They account for 1% of intracranial masses, and has been reported as high as 5 per 1000 on autopsy.  The male to female ratio is 4 to 1.  Symptomatic cysts may present at any age.  Arachnoid cysts can be diagnosed on fetal ultrasound, and can be seen as early as during the early second trimester.  Most fetal diagnoses, however, are made later in pregnancy.

Arachnoid cysts usually occur from a congenital abnormality, arising from arachnoid clefts or arachnoid duplications.  They are not associated with chromosomal aneuploidy, but can be associated with brain malformations such as agenesis of the corpus callosum, absent cava, deficient cerebellar lobulation, and Arnold-Chiari type I malformation.  Acquired arachnoid cysts may develop due to CSF entrapment in arachnoid adhesions due to surgery, trauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, neonatal infections, or neoplasm.  They may or may not be connected to the ventricular system.  They can occur in both the cranium and the spinal canal.  They often indent a cerebral hemisphere or invaginate into fissures, however severe compression is rare.  Slow growth may occur with accumulation of fluid.

Arachnoid cysts are usually asymptomatic and found incidentally on imaging.  If symptoms do occur, they may include headache, calvarial bulging, seizures, and less commonly focal neurologic signs.  Symptoms may occur due to cerebral cortical irritation, brain compression, or obstruction of CSF flow.  Diagnosis is made through imaging.

Diagnostic imaging characteristics of arachnoid cysts on CT and MRI include having a smooth-surface, being non-enhancing with contrast, approximating CSF, and being homogeneous.  The consistency of the fluid in the cyst should approximate the CSF.  It should be homogeneous throughout, although simple septa within the cyst can occur.  The cysts usually occur near the cerebral fissures, with 50-60% in the middle cranial fossa.  They occur more commonly on the left side.
Specifically on MRI, these cysts are isointense or hypointense to brain on T1, and hyperintense to brain on T2.  MRI is superior to CT for detecting complicated cysts.

Fetal diagnosis of arachnoid cysts can be made by ultrasound.  Characteristics on ultrasound include seeing an anechoic cystic mass and thin smooth walls
adjacent to the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, or brain stem.

This patient's arachnoid cyst is asymptomatic, and is likely not the cause of his hearing loss.  Further treatment of this cyst is not needed unless symptoms arise in the future.
