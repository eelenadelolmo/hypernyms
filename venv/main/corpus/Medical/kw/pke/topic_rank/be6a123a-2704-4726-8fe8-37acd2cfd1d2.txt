This differential is for the clinical appearance of brain death, not the scintigraphic images shown.
79 year-old male found unconscious with head CT showing an intra-cranial bleed admitted to the surgical intensive care unit for neurosurgery intervention. Head CT on arrival demonstrated intra-ventricular hemorrhage with evidence of chronic micro vascular ischemic disease. Brain MRI and Cerebral angiogram demonstrated an arterial-venous malformation supplied by the left posterior cerebral artery. After admission, mental functions declined and clinical diagnosis of brain death was declared with request for confirmatory test.
