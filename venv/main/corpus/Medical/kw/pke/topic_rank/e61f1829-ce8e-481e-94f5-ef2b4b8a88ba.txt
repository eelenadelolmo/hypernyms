Chondrosarcoma is managed similarly to osteosarcoma, with radical surgery being the treatment of choice.  When only excision is employed, 90% of tumors recur locally.  The overall 10 year survival rate following surgery is approximately 65%.  Radiation therapy as the primary modality for chondrosarcoma is limited.  Pulmonary metastasis occur, but the value of chemotherapy is not well established.  Doxorubicin yields a response rate of only 17% for metastatic chondrosarcoma.
