Physical examination (problem focused PE):

Range of motion was evaluated utilizing dual inclinometry.  Findings were compared to the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment Fifth Edition.  Active range of motion of the cervical spine revealed flexion to be accomplished to 50°/50°, left rotation to 80°/80°, right rotation to 75°/80°, left lateral bending to 50°/45°, right lateral bending to 35°/45° and extension to 50°/60°.  The patient reports no pain or discomfort during these ranges of motion.  Reflexes of the bicep, triceps, brachioradialis were all graded 2/4 bilaterally.  Muscle strengths of the upper extremities were found to be of essentially normal strength bilaterally.  Hoffman’s and Tromner&#39;s procedures for upper extremity pathological reflex were absent.  Active range of motion of the shoulders was within normal limits.  Inspection reveals a 21 cm scar vertically over the lower back from previous surgery.  He had a transverse scar over the cervical region from cervical surgery.  Range of motion of the lumbar spine could not be evaluated due to the severe instability of his lumbar spine and failure of hardware in his lumbar spine.  He is able to sit and to stand.  He utilizes a cane in his right hand.  The Achilles reflex was graded 1/4 on the left and 2/4 on the right.  To light touch he had numbness over the lumbar paraspinal regions bilaterally that extends below his buttock and up to the thoracolumbar region.  Tenderness was noted in the right posterior cervical region and medial to the superior angle of right scapula.  The patient attempted to arise onto his toes and heels in the static position.  Weakness was noted during ankle dorsiflexion and ankle plantarflexion on the left side.  Extensor hallucis weakness was noted on the left side graded 4/5.  

Auscultation of the lungs were clear bilaterally.  Auscultation of the heart revealed arrhythmia but was not definitive for murmur.
Patient is status post posterior L2-L4 decompression with interbody and posteriolateral fusion performed in July, 2013 for treatment of a junctional syndrome above his previous L4-S1 fusion. He is also status post C5-C7 ACDF performed in May, 2012. Originally, he is status post the L4-S1 fusion performed in June, 1999. He also had two previous back surgeries in 1995 and 1999.

He continues to have some residual numbness along the bilateral aspect of the axial low back with extension into the buttocks bilaterally. His orthopedic surgeon explained that there is a pseudoarthrosis at the L2-L5 levels with evidence of the hardware loosening as seen on plain film radiographs and CT imaging. Ultimately, he needs an anterior/posterior spinal fusion from L2-S1 with lateral interbody cages at L2-L3 and L3-L4 and posterior segmental instrumentation from L2-S1, all performed as a same day staged procedure. Unfortunately, at this time, the patient is refusing further spinal surgery.

He describes his ongoing low back pain is intractable and intolerable on a daily basis. Although it is strongly recommended that he have another major surgery to a spine due to the failure of his revision device, he is currently refusing any further surgical intervention due to his immense dissatisfaction with the results of his prior lumbar surgeries.
Most recently, lumbar: 
1. Postsurgical changes at L2/L3 and L3/L4. Old postoperative changes at L4/L5 and L5/S1. Tenuous bony fusion at L5/S1 without complete bony fusion. 

2. Loosening involving interpeduncular screws in the L2 vertebral body and with the intervertebral fusion device at L3/L4 

3. Interbody cage failure on the left side at the level of L3/L4.  

Most recently, cervical:
1. Anterior fusion of C5 to C7. Intact osseous fusion across the disc spaces. 

2. C5-C6 spondylolysis narrowing the left lateral recess and foramen. 

3. Small central C4/C5 disc herniation

The patient is a 49-year-old man who has had multiple surgical interventions.

History of Present Illness:
In the 1980s he fell out of a tree 3-1/2 stories in the air while chasing a raccoon - the treetops snapped and he fell injuring his back.  He reports having surgical intervention to his lower back in 1995, 1999, 2010 and 2013.  Interbody cages were utilized between L3-4 in the 2013 surgical intervention.

The patient reports that in 1997 he injured his neck while snow shoveling and snaking sewers.  He reports having cervical surgery in 1999.  He reports being disabled from work from 1999 to 2004.  He reports returning to employ as a school bus driver/truck driver in 2004.  The patient reports having been involved in a motor vehicle accident in 2011 and then a second MVA in 2012.  In the second car accident he reports being T-boned by another vehicle traveling at 50 mph.  He reports having cervical surgery in 2012.  It is at that time that he began chiropractic care.  Chiropractic care for his neck included instrument assisted soft tissue mobilization along with ice therapy.  Relative to his low back he also had Soft tissue assisted soft tissue mobilization and flexion distraction therapy.  Following the 2013 surgical intervention to his lumbar spine he had interbody cage failure on the left side at the level of L3/L4.  

He denies any change in bowel or bladder funcion. He denies saddle parasthesia. 

He denies other work episodes of injury, vehicular accidents or slips falls or athletic episodes wherein an injury was sustained to his neck or lower back regions.  

He denies rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, kidney disease, tuberculosis shortness of breath, hearing loss kidney stones, headaches, cancer, gout, seizures, asthma, ulcers, or loss of sight.  

Past medical history:

The patient reports that on February 2010 he was given a cardiac stress test.  He reports the week before the stress test he had been unloading a semi-tractor-trailer and hand discomfort in his chest.  Unfortunately within 15 seconds of beginning the stress test such induced a coronary occlusion/heart attack.  He was immediately treated with 5 stents placed in the left side of his heart, per patient.  

History of 2 benign thyroid cysts. He takes levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.

The patient reports having esophageal repair for Mallory-Weiss syndrome in 2011.  

COPD, for which he takes Advair and Spiriva.  

He reports fracturing his right arm in in 4 planes. He reports having surgery for the hallux of his left foot.

Allergies: Dilaudid, Lidocaine, Novocaine, Xylocaine

Social Hx: Current smoker with 45 pack year smoking history. Infrequent alcohol use. Denies use of illicit drugs.

This is a excellent case provided by contributor (JG), a chiropractor, demonstrating both good and poor outcomes from spine fusion in the same patient.  As described in the topic for this case, cervical fusion has a more positive outcome regarding symptom resolution when compared to lumbar fusion. The concept of superior expected outcomes for cervical fusion versus lumbar fusion is true of the general population as well. [1] Despite the numerous surgeries this patient has had on his lumbar spine, he still experiences significant pain, numbness, loss of range of motion and overall disability. His cervical spine, however, has returned to near normal range of motion, without any report of pain or numbness. This patient reports being very satisfied with his cervical fusion, but very dissatisfied with his numerous lumbar surgeries.
