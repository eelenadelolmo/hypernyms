Anterior to the thyroid cartilage, just to the right of midline, there is a fairly well-defined cystlike mass. The mass measures 2.5cm transversely, 1.5 cm anterior to posterior, and 2 cm superior to inferior. No aggressive features noted. Although it appears centered to the right of midline, it does reach midline.
