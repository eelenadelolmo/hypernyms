Non-focal neurological examination.
Surgical intervention pending.
• Heterogeneous signal lesion - mixed iso and hyperintense on T1WI 
• Hyperintense on T2WI - in the region of the right lenticular nucleus, anterior limb of the right internal capsule, and external capsule
• Hypointense rim on T1WI that “blooms” on T2WI
• No mass effect
• Minimal enhancement seen post-gadolinium
Cerebral Cavernous Malformation
• Cavernous malformation
• Hemorrhagic neoplasm
• AVM
• Capillary telangiectasia
32 year-old man with the recent onset of seizures.
Cavernous angiomas are the most commonly identified brain vascular malformation.  They are discrete multilobulated berry-like lesions, containing various stages of hemorrhage.  There is no neural tissue seen within the lesion.  Cavernous angiomas can be seen throughout the parenchyma, more commonly at the frontal and temporal lobes.  80% are supratentorial, often seen within the deep white matter, corticomedullary junction, and basal ganglia.  They can also be seen within the spinal cord.  Within the posterior fossa, the pons and cerebellar hemispheres are preferred locations.  Multiple lesions are seen 50% of the time.

The most common age of presentation is 20 to 40 years of age, presenting with headache, seizure, or focal neurological deficit.  Associated occult hemorrhage is common.

On CT, cavernous angiomas appear iso to hyperdense.  Varied enhancement is seen following contrast administration, and calcifications are commonly seen.  

On MR, a characteristic “popcorn-like” appearance is seen.  This pattern results from multiple mixed signal intensities secondary to varying stages of hemorrhage.  A low signal rim that “blooms” on T2-weighted and gradient imaging is secondary to hemosiderin and is typical of cavernous angioma.
