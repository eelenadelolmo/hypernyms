-Left flank tender with palpable mass
-Low hematocrit
The patient's h/h levels stabilized after embolization.  She was scheduled for subsequent surgical excision.
-Noncontrast axial CT images through the abdomen demonstrate a large, heterogeneous, mixed soft tissue and fat attenuation mass in the left retroperitoneum.  Normal left renal parenchyma is not clearly identified.  Incidentally noted is a fat attenuation mass arising from the cortex of the upper pole of the right kidney.
-Gray- scale ultrasound images of the kidneys demonstrate nonvisualization of a left kidney.  Within the upper pole of the right kidney is a hyperechoic mass within the cortex.
-Digitally-subtracted images from a left renal arteriogram in the arterial phase demonstrate draping of the arterial branches around a mass.  Parenchymal phase images demonstrate the enhancing left kidney to be displaced laterally and inferiorly.  Puddling of contrast is seen within the region of the upper pole tumor arising from a vessel that ascends from a lower pole arterial branch.  Final angiogram after injection of Avitene slurry and placement of coils with the catheter in the left renal artery demonstrates successful embolization of the left kidney and mass.

-Angiomyolipoma
-Renal cell carcinoma with macroscopic fat
-Retroperitoneal liposarcoma
This 58 year-old-female with a known left renal mass by prior imaging presents to the ED complaining of left flank pain.  Upon presentation, the patient was hypotensive and anemic.
