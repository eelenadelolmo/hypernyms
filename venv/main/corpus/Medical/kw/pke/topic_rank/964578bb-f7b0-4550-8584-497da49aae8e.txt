None needed for this benign lesion.
On MR images, there is a focal area of very decreased signal on both the T1 and T2 weighted images within the right iliac bone at the level of S2.
This corresponds to an approximate 2.2 X 1.7cm sclerotic density in the right ilium just lateral to the right SI joint on a pelvic radiograph.
There is no associated increased radiotracer uptake of this lesion on bone scan.
Enostosis (also known as a bone island)
A 56 year old female with a history of basal cell carcinoma who needed MRI evaluation of a lipomatous growth at the base of the spine.
