serial exams and thyroglobulin, TFT labs
Between the thyroid isthmus and left lobe, there is a heterogeneous-signal mass, measuring 2.3 cm cranio-caudad by 2.4 cm x 2.4 cm. Most of the mass is isoechoic with surrounding thyroid tissue, but there are areas of both hypo- and hyper-echogenicity, as well as a hypervascular rim. Some of the hyper-echoic areas likely represent small calcifications.
