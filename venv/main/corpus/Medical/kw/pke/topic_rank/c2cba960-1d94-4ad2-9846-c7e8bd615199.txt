Irregularly irregular heart rate and rhythm on both physical examination and EKG.
Positive cardiac enzymes after admission to emergency department.
This patient was admitted to the hospital and rate controlled. Since the atrial fibrillation was of new onset he was scheduled for chemical cardioversion pending full cardiology review.
PA radiograph demonstrated the presence of horizontal, non-branching white lines best seen at the periphery of the lung above the costophrenic angle. This is due to thickening of the interlobular septa resulting from fluid leaking into the pulmonary interstitium.
