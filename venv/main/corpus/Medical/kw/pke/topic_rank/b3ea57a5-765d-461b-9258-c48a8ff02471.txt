Decompression of craniocervical junction with fusion
CT and MRI show classic findings of Ankylosing spondylitis with "squaring"of vertebral bodies, fusion of the facets and spinous processes and calcifications of the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments.  
There is an unfused fracture through the base of the odontoid which is fused to the arch of C1 and the clivus. There is cord injury at this level due to hyperophic boney changes and cord compression 
There are also classic changes of achondroplasia.
