TTP at the base of the 5th metatarsal bone.
Pain control and immobilization.  No repeat films have been performed within 6 months.
There is a complete fracture through the proximal portion of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, without significant displacement.

There is a second fracture which is complex but incomplete at the junction of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone with the shaft. The predominant fracture lucency passes obliquely from the lateral cortex to the medullary cavity.  Additionally, there is fracture lucency at the medial aspect of the metatarsal base connection with the shaft which does not directly connect with contralateral lucency.

No other fractures are evident.  There is significant soft tissue swelling adjacent to the fifth metatarsal fractures.
