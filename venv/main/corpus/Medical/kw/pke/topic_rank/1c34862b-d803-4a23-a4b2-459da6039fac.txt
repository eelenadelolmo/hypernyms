There is an increase in size of the homogeneously enhancing mass that extends from the posterior left orbit along the left optic nerve to the anterior clinoid process. It contacts the left superior oblique and left lateral rectus muscles as well as the supraclinoid portion of the left internal carotid arteries. Invasion of these structures cannot be ruled out. The intracranial portion of the tumor measures 1.4 x 1.6 x 1.1cm as compared to 1 x 1.2 x 1cm on the latest comparison study in 2003. The intraorbital portion of the tumor measures 2.4 x 1.5 x 1.1cm as compared to approximately 1 x 1 x 1cm in 2003.
