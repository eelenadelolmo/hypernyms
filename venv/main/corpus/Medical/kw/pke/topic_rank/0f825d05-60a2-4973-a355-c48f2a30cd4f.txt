Peripheral blood smear had elevated eosinophils at 19.4%.
Systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment.  70% of patients usually have improvement in radiographic findings within 1 week of starting steroids.
The axial CT images show primarily peripheral and nonsegmental areas of consolidation primarily involving the upper lobes.  The superior segments of the lower lobes show some areas of peripheral consolidation as well; however, the basal segments are spared.  Some scattered tree and bud opacities with surrounding ground glass opacities and sub pleural linear and reticular opacities are visualized; however, the dominant pattern is that of peripheral consolidation.

The patient presented with a persistent cough and chronic infectious symptoms for over 5 months.
