No specific treatment or follow-up is required for an ovarian dermoid.  However, a large dermoid can sometimes precipitate ovarian torsion.
Static gray scale and color flow Doppler sonographic images of the left ovary demonstrate a small rounded hyperechoic area adjacent to a larger hypoechoic cystic mass.  No hypervascularity is demonstrated.
