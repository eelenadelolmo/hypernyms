History of breast cancer, recently diagnosed.  Now c/o progressive left knee pain.
This young woman had a suspicious lump in her left breast.  After FNA and a later core biopsy, this was determined to be infiltrating ductal carcinoma.  She has not yet undergone mastectomy.  If it were not for the breast cancer diagnosis, her presentation with knee pain and the vague plain-film finding might normally not have raised such a high level of concern to warrant an MRI.
