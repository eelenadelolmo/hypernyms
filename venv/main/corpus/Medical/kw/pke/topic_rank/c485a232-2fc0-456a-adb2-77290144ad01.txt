PLAIN FILM:
1) OBLITERATION Of SOFT TISSUE PLANES ABOVE THE PATELLA
2) JOINT EFFUSION
3) AVULSED PATELLAR FRAGMENTS
4) SOFT TISSUE SWELLING
5) AVULSED TENDON RETRACTION ('BALLING UP'/THICKENING)

MRI T2WI FATSAT:
1) DISRUPTION OF NORMAL LAMINAR TENDON - 3 OF 4 TENDONS AVULSED AND RETRACTED. ONLY VASTUS INTERMEDIUS REMAINS INTACT.
2) NORMAL PATELLAR POSITION (NEGATIVE PATELLA BAJA).
3) HIGH SIGNAL INTENSITY AT SITE OF TEAR AND IN SURROUNDING SOFT TISSUE.
