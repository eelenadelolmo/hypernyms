Systolic blood pressure on admission was measured in the 190's
Non contrast CT demonstrates high density material within the left occipital lobe compressing the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle

Saggital T1 MRI without contrast shows this area to be hyperintense consistent with subacute hemorrage (likely intra or extracellular met-hemoglobin).

T2 images demonstrate hyperintensity with surrounding edema.
Hypertensive Hemorrhage
Hypertensive hemorrhage
vascular malformation
tumor hemorrhage (primary or metastatic)
amyloid angiopathy
40 year old african american male with history of hypertension complaining of headache.
- Most commonly occurs within penetrating arteries off of the MCA/Basilar Artery
 - Location involves: basal ganglia (80%), Pons (10%), Deep gray matter (5%), Cerebellum (5%)
 - Poor prognostic indicators include large size, brainstem location, intraventricular extension
 - Often self limiting due to tamponade effect of increased ICP
 - Imaging characteristics include high density on non-contrast CT scan with variable appearance on MR related to the stage of blood product degradation (bright on T1 in this patient suggesting intra or extracellular met-hemoglobin)
