MRI- In the anterior left temporal lobe, there is a 2.3X1.3 cm oval sub acute hematoma with a rim of low signal on T2 and high signal intensity on T1 and central high signal intensity on T2 and intermediate signal intensity on T1. There is mild surrounding edema and mass effect. On T2 and flair sequences there is abnormal increased signal intensity extending through out the entire temporal tip and into the temporal operculum, mesial temporal lobe and insula. There is abnormal increased signal intensity along the right mesial temporal lobe. On pre-contrast T1 weighted images and T2 weighted images there is diffuse confluent gyriform pattern along the affected areas. This demonstrates mild degree of enhancement following the administration of contrast.

CT- Focal areas of hyper-attenuation in the left anterior temporal lobe as well as more diffuse areas on hyper-attenuation in the same region. There is a focus of hyper-attenuation in the left calcar avis just anterior to the left tentorium cerebelli. Decreased attenuation is noted in the bilateral insula, left greater then right, as well as the right frontal white matter.

99m-Tc HMPAO Scintigraphy-There is increased radiotracer uptake in the left temporal lobe and left paterital lobes. There is a focal oval shaped area of decreased radiotracer uptake in the left temporal lobe.
