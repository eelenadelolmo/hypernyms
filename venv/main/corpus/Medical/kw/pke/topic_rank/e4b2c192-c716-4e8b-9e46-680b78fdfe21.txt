Baby boy noted to have abnormal "protrusion" in region of lumbar spine during well baby check.
Congenital kyphosis can be categorized as Type I-Type III.  Type I patients have a failure in anterior vertebral body formation which can be further subdivided into: posterolateral quadrant vertebra, posterior hemivertebra, butterfly (sagittal cleft) vertebra, and anterior or anterolateral wedged vertebra.  Patients with type II malformations have anterior failure of vertebral body segmentation.  Type III are mixed anomalies.

Patients with congenital kyphosis are typically treated prophylactically due to potential for rapid progression of deformity and concern for neurologic symptoms caused by cord compression.
