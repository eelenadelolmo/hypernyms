Generally the patient was an appropriate for gestational age female infant in no acute distress.
Physical exam of the HEENT, Chest, Heart, Abdomen, GU and Extremities was unremarkable.
On neurologic examination there was no spontaneous movement of the proximal muscles of the upper extremities. The patient had some flexion of the hands. Upper extremities were hypotonic both actively and passively. Normal spontaneous movement of lower extremities.  Lower extremities were normotonic both actively and passively.
Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Symmetric plantar grasp reflexes in lower extremities but absent in upper extremities. Normal truncal tone.
Surgical de-bulking of the epidural cervical mass was preformed within 1 week of birth. After a 1-month period of observation while awaiting confirmation of pathology the cervical mass was found to have enlarged and recurred. The patient also developed paresis of the right hemidiaphragm with resultant respiratory distress requiring right hemi-diaphragm plication. Chemotherapy was pursued after discussion with the family and the patient was started on vincristine, actinomycin and Interferon-alpha.
• MR C-spine: Extradural mass in the cervical spinal canal from C2 to C6 that flattens and displaces the spinal cord posteriorly and to the left. The  mass  extends through  the  neural  foramina  at  C3-C4,  C4-C5,  and  C5-C6. Lesion has peripheral enhancement with contrast injection and the central portion appears necrotic. No  flow-void  is  seen  in  the    right vertebral  artery  suggesting  compression  of  arterial  flow  by  the  tumor.

• CT neck/ chest: Status-post cervical tumor debulking there is an ill-defined  extradural  mass  in  the  upper  cervical canal  extending  anterolaterally  outside  of  the  spinal  canal. There are bilateral pulmonary nodules suspicious for pulmonary metastases. There  are  multiple  lytic  skeletal  lesions involving  the  T5 and T8 vertebral bodies,  posterior  right 10th  rib, and proximal left humerus.

• CXR: Progressive erosion of the pedicles of the right cervical spine. The right hemidiaphragm is significantly higher than the left suggestive of paresis with volume loss in the right lung. 

• Lateral knee: There is a soft tissue mass anterior to the right knee mesuring 15mm x 23mm. There is a lucency in the anterior proximal metaphysis of the tibia and erosion of the medial aspect of the proximal tibial metaphysis.

Referral from an outlying hospital for lack of upper extremity movement. Patient is a near-term infant female born at 36 and 6/7 weeks by induced vaginal delivery to a 19y/o primigravida mom. Pregnancy was induced due to gestational hypertension. There was no shoulder dystocia but due to compound presentation, delivery was instrument assisted. Apgars were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes. Infant was referred to the regional NICU on day of life #3 after referring physician noted a lack of movement in the bilateral upper extremities.
Our patient presented with neurological deficits shortly after birth found to be from a solitary cervical lesion compressing the spinal cord. No other abnormalities were noted on the initial exam. Despite surgical debulking the tumor progressed and a bone scan and CT of the neck and chest were obtained to assess for multicentric disease. On CT multiple skeletal metastases were seen including lytic lesions of T8 and T12 vertebral bodies, right posterior 10th rib, and proximal left humerus. Additionally bilateral nodular densities were seen in the lungs suspicious for pulmonary metastases. On bone scan abnormality was identified in the distal metaphysis of the right femur and proximal metaphysis of the tibia. A soft tissue mass of the right knee was also identified on plain film which had been missed on initial exam and subsequently rapidly enlarged. Shortly after instituting chemotherapy the infant developed respiratory distress and was found to have right hemidiaphragm paresis likely from vagal nerve involvement. A right hemi-diaphragm plication was preformed. The child's lesions were stable on post chemotherapy induction imaging and chemotherapy is ongoing.
