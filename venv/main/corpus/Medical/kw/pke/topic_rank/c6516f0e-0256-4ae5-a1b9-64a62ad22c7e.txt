There is a a large mass extruding from the abdomen that contains all the liver and some bowel.
Wrapping of the herniated abdominal contents and supportive care until age 5-6 months.  If the patient can tolerate surgery at that time, corrective surgery shall be performed.
Obstetric ultrasound images at 25 and 36 WEGA show a  herniation of abdominal contents including the umbilicus, but mostly liver.  No other anatomic abnormalities are detectable by ultrasound.
Radiographs taken during the post-natal period in the neonatal intensive care unit demonstrate a large abdominal mass.  The patient's pulmonary status is poor and he is presumed to suffer from broncho-pulmonary dysplasia.
A CT of the abdomen with intravenous contrast demonstrates normally enhancing but "overly ascended" kidneys.  The liver shows normal portal venous enhancement but it is completely herniated through the paraumbilical defect along with some bowel.
Omphalocele
Omphalocele
Gastroschisis
Six week-old infant boy delivered at term by caesarean section.  The presence of a large omphalocele was detected early in the pregnancy.
The omphalocele occurs when the midgut fails to return to the peritoneal cavity in the tenth gestational week.  About 30% of babies born with omphalocele are premature.  Cardiac anomalies are the most significant associated abnormalities, but lung dysplasia can be a significant post-natal complication, as is seen in this case.  The kidneys frequently "overascend" due to the full or partial herniation of midgut organs, thus exerting mass effect upon the chest cavity.
Surgery is mandatory to correct the abnormality.  
Gastroschisis is distinguished from omphalocele by the presence of a normal umbilicus in all cases.
