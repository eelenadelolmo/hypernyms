Severe cachexia, hemodynamic instability, respiratory distress, and a falling hematocrit.
Conventional pulmonary arteriography and coiling.
A contrast enhanced axial CT image demonstrates a pseudoaneurysm arising from a middle lobar branch of the rightpulmonary artery just proximal to the right inferior lobar artery (often incorrectly called the interlobar artery or artery intermedius). There is complete obstruction of the superior lobar branches of the right pulmonary artery. There is high density consolidation surrounding the lesion representing hemorrhage into the surrounding parenchyma of the lung.  The window of the CT image provided does not allow for differentiation of tumor from hemorrhagic consolidation and a comparision image from a prior study would be helpful.  

After coiling the pseudo were placed no flow is noted in the aneurysm.
Pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm secondary to erosion of tumor into the wall of the middle lobar branches of the right pulomary artery and obstruction of superior lobar branches of the right pulmonary artery due to mass effect from the tumor.
Pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm (much more likely to bleed)
•infection (especially tuberulosis = Rasmussen’s aneurysm)
•tumor invasion
•trauma ( especially iatrogenic)
Pulmonary artery aneurysm
•pulmonary hypertension
•pulmonic valve stenosis
•Behcet's disease
•Takayasu's arteritis
•congenital
•Hugh Stoven disease
Pulmonary artery aneurysm mimic
•arterio-venous fistulas
59 year old male with recent diagnosis of right lung non-small cell lung cancer presents with severe hemoptysis.
Although not performed in this case, selective angiograms of the bronchial arteries and other arteries which can subserve lung masses (intercostals, thyrocervical trunk, internal mammary, lateral thoracic, long thoracic) should be considered in this type of case.  The source of massive hemorrhage might not have been from the pulmonary artery pseudoaneuysm solely or at all.
