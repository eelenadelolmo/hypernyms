Delayed Gastric Emptying, likely secondary to diabetic gastroparesis.
Delayed gastric emptying of acute onset: pain, cold, medications, ileus, viral gastroenteritis, and metabolic derangements such as hyperglycemia and hypokalemia.  

Chronic causes of delayed gastric emptying: gastric outlet obstruction, postvagotomy state, gastric ulcer, chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudoobstruction, gastroesophageal reflux, diabetes mellitus, amyloidosis, and uremia, to name a few
