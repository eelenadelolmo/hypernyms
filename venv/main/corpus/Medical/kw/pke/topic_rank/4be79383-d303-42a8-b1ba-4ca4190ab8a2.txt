Well developed, well nourished appropriate to stated age.
Regular rate and rhythm, II/VI decrescendo diastolic murmur best appreciated over left upper sternal border.  No JVD, 2+ peripheral pulses U/LE bilaterally. No carotid/abdominal bruits.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
A follow up LE Doppler Venography was performed and found no evidence of lower extremity deep vein thromboses. 

Long term, outpatient anticoagulation with low-molecular weight heparin and bridge to warfarin.
• Aneurysm of Ascending aorta (cm): 4.1 diameter ( unchanged)
   
• Multiple acute on chronic pulmonary emboli (filling defects on CT) with minimally enlarged main pulmonary artery measuring up to 3.0 cm.  
 
• Small patent foramen ovale
 
• Stable ascending aorta aneurysm.
 
• Multiple pulmonary nodules as detailed above.  Pulmonary nodule in left lower lobe is nonspecific and could represent pulmonary infarct in the setting of pulmonary emboli.  Recommend non contrast CT chest in 6 months for further evaluation.
Multiple pulmonary emboli (acute on chronic) asymptomatic
• Pulmonary emboli
• Multiple pulmonary nodules
• nonspecific nodule in lower lobe may represent pulmonary infarct in setting of pulmonary emboli
• aneurysmal dilatation of ascending aorta
65 year old woman with a history of coronary artery disease presents for a routine follow up.  She denies any symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, or leg pain.
This is a otherwise healthy, asymptomatic woman who presented for annual screening and monitoring of a thoracic aortic aneurysm.  She had no history of prolonged immobilization or known history of thrombophilia, and was found on this screening test to have multiple acute on chronic pulmonary emboli, also in the context of a patent foramen ovale.  

A follow up lower extremity venograph ultrasound showed no evidence of deep vein thromboses.  

This case is a prime example of how carefully examining the whole study image can result in important changes in treatment trajectory.
