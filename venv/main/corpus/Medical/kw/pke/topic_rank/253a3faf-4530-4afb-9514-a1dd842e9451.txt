Texto: 
Diffuse posterior neck pain w/o any focal tenderness on exam. Patient was neurologically intact.
The lesion was surgically resected and referred to Radiation-Oncology for XRT therapy.
MRI of the cervical spine and with subsequent CE brain MR demonstrate a lobulated mass within the posterior fossa. The lesion appears to originate in the fourth ventricle and is centered on the midline. The tumor is isointense to gray matter on T1 and mixed iso/hypointense on T2 weighted images. There are scant areas of T1&T2 hypodensity seen which are representative of calcifications or flow voids. There is scattered enhancement with contrast administration.
