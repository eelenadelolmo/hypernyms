Diffuse swelling and ecchymosis encompassing the right ankle and an inability to bear weight on his right leg.
The fractures were treated with surgical intervention.  The associated fracture blisters were kept intact intraoperatively.
Plain films demonstrate a comminuted fracture of the distal tibia with intraarticular extension and  associated soft tissue swelling seen in the region of the right ankle and foot.  There is a well marginated ovoid density which measures 4.1 x 3.4 x 2.4 cm seen overlying the soft tissues near the distal tibial fracture.  Two similar smaller densities are seen just inferior to the larger density.

Fracture blisters are tense vesicles or bullae that arise in the sub-epidermal level of the skin following significant trauma or torsional-type injury.  They most commonly follow a fracture involving the tibia, ankle, or elbow and generally form within 24-48 hours of the acute injury.  Fracture blisters are seen in 2.9% of all acute fractures requiring hospitalization and in 5.2% of all ankle fractures.  Increased risk for fracture blister development is seen in alcoholism, hypertension, smoking, peripheral vascular disease, lymphatic obstruction, and diabetes.

Fracture blisters result from the separation of the dermis and epidermis secondary to strains created in the skin during initial fracture deformation, coupled with the differing elastic properties of the layers.  Fluid then fills this potential space.

Fracture blisters most often contain a sterile transudate, but can also be blood-filled.  Once a blister has ruptured, colonization with skin pathogens occurs rapidly and continues until reepithelialization occurs.  Reepithelialization may take up to three weeks.

While the prognostic significance of fracture blister formation is controversial, the formation of blood-filled blisters does correlate with a more significant injury clinically.  There is an increased risk of postoperative wound infection when fracture blisters are present at the time of surgery.
