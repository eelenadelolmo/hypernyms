Pneumothorax
A 25 year old male presents with pleuritic chest pain and tachypnea.
Editor's Note: Any pneumothorax one observes as a radiologist should be considered a potential tension pneumothorax until history or stability over time proves it to be otherwise.  

The ordering physician should be contacted directly regarding this diagnosis.  For medical-legal reasons, the ACR suggests that the name of the doctor, the substance of the conversation, the date, and the time should be included in the radiologist's report.
