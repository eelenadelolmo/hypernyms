Labs
- Blood gas (360 minutes of life on 3L NC): pH 7.33, pCO2 47, pO2 35, BE -1
- Na 139, K+ 3.7, ionized Ca 1.31, Hct 51, glucose 60 gm/dl
The patient was treated with supplemental oxygen and bag-mask ventilation in an effort to treat his hypoxia and episodes of desaturation.  Sildenafil and lasix were ineffective in treating the patient's likely pulmonary hypertension.  Invasive procedures not performed per parental request and support was withdrawn.  The patient died soon after withdrawal of support.
A single portable frontal view of the infant demonstrates multiple anomalies, including fragmented epiphyses, shortened humeri and femurs, a small rib cage, and vertebral calcifications.  The cardiothymic silhouette fills most of the chest, and there is a nonobstructed bowel gas pattern.

Term male infant in respiratory distress born to a 37 year old G1 mother at 41+1 weeks of gestational age.  Transferred to the NICU following routine resuscitation.  

Prior fetal ultrasound demonstrated short humeri and femurs.  Fetal echocardiogram demonstrated Tetralogy of Fallot.  The mother was noted to be Group B Streptococcus positive and was treated with adequate antibiotics.   Fetal genetic testing was negative and chromosomes were noted to be normal.
The patient presented in respiratory distress and was diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot based on echocardiography, however the mild amount of pulmonary stenosis did not account for the patient’s persistent hypoxia.  The patient also experienced episodes of desaturation and bradycardia.  A confounding pulmonary etiology was considered, including pulmonary hypertension secondary to suspected pulmonary hypoplasia as seen on the chest and abdomen radiograph.

Genetics was consulted and biochemical testing of peroxisome function demonstrated deficiencies in phytanic acid oxidation (147.8) and plasmalogen synthesis (17.03) in fibroblasts along with low red blood cell plasmalogen levels (0.002).  These results indicate a deficiency in peroxisomal plasmalogen synthesis and a defect in the PEX7 gene which confirms the diagnosis of Rhizomelic Chondrodysplasia Punctata, Type 1.

Counseling was performed with the family and, given the poor prognosis and limited life span with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, the parents decided against any invasive life saving measures and chose to withdraw support so as not to prolong his discomfort.  

Supplemental oxygen was removed and the patient made very little inspiratory effort while falling into a comatose state.  The patient was pronounced deceased at 32 days of life due to cardio-respiratory failure secondary to Tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary hypoplasia, and Rhizomelic Chondrodysplasia Punctata.
