-Familial and non-familial patterns exist with synchronous lesions seen up to 25% of familial cases. The likelihood of synchronous lesions drops to 5-10% in sporadic cases.
-The lesions are highly vascular , and the “Salt and Pepper” appearance may be seen in larger lesions (>2 cm) on MR. This is suggestive of the diagnosis when in the correct location.
- Four common locations:
    Middle ear cavity-tympanicum paragangliomas
    Jugular foramen-jugular paragangliomas
    High carotid space-vagal paragangliomas
    Carotid bifurcation-carotid body paragangliomas
