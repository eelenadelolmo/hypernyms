Vertical curvilinear line, convex laterally, extends from apex and ends in tear drop.  Lungs are clear. Cardiomedistinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature are normal.
Azygos lobe
Azygos fissure
Cough.
The reported incidence of the azygos fissure varies and is approximately 1 - 0.4%.  Normal variant consisting of two layers of parietal and visceral pleura and is caused by an invagination of the pleura by incomplete migration of the azygos vein.  The normal position of the azygos vein is at the right tracheobronchial angle. The invagination of pleura potentially limits the spread of apical consolidation to the azygos lobe.
