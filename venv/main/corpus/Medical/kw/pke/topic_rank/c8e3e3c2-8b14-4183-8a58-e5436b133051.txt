Texto: 
Right wrist without erythema or edema.  Full range of motion.
Pain with flexion, extension, and radial deviation.  
Tender to palpation in anatomical snuff box and on dorsal aspect of wrist.
MR imaging with and without contrast demonstrated avid uptake at proximal and distal pole of scaphoid, ruling out avascular necrosis.  Pt re-immobilized and ultrasonic bone stimulation performed with follow up imaging showing adequate response to therapy.  Plan for continued stimulation and close follow up with option for internal fixation if union does not complete.
• nondisplaced fracture at the waist of the right scaphoid with extension to the distal articular surface
• cystic lucencies adjacent to the fracture line
Non-Union of old scaphoid fracture with intraossous cysts
• scaphoid fracure
• interosseous cysts
