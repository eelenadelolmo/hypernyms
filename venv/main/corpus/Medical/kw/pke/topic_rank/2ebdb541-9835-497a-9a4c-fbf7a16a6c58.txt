Pulsatile mass in proximal aspect of right upper thigh. Also ecchymosis is noted within the region. Complete blood count shows decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit.
Ultrasound guided compression therapy has proved effective for treating pseudoaneurysms. During ultrasound guided compression repair, the neck ,or tract, of the pseudoaneurysm is compressed until there is no blood flow detected in the pathway. However, this approach is time consuming and painful (for both the patient and the sonographer).

Ultrasound guided thrombin injection has been shown to be safe and effective. During Thrombin-Injection a needle is used to inject a small amount of thrombin into the pseudoaneurysm which causes immediate thrombosis.

>> Contrast enhancement into collection on CT
>> Pulsatile/Swirling pattern seen in collection on gray-scale sonographic imaging
>> "To and fro" flow in the neck
>> Color Doppler imaging demonstrates swirling "yin-yang" pattern where one half of lumen is red and other half is blue

Arteriovenous malformation
56 year old male with new onset atrial fibrillation 2 days ago and ST elevation acute myocardial infarction who underwent emergent cardiac catherization. Patient reported increasing pain and swelling over femoral artery catherization site. Reports pulsatile nature to soft tissue swelling.
This patient was successfully treated with ultrasound guided mechanical compression but it took three hours to achieve hemostasis.
