36 year old G0P0 female presenting for infertility work up.
Patient is undergoing workup for infertility.  Incidentally diverticulae were demonstrated on the hysterosalpingogram.  Since this patient had no previous pregnancies or surgery, the congenital anomaly of a uterine cervical diverticulum rather than a pregnancy associated sacculation is the likely diagnosis.
