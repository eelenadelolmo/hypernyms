No treatment is needed unless painful, compressing important structures (ie, nerve or artery), extremity length discrepancy or malignant transformation.  Follow up radiographs should be obtained if the patient has increased pain.  Growth of the exostoses should cease once the physis closes.
Multiple exostoses projecting away from the knee joint on the distal femur and proximal tibia and fibula.  There are also multiple lesions noted on the distal radius and ulna with associated shortening of the ulna and abnormal angulation of the radial epiphysis.  The exostoses show cortical continuity with the metaphyses consistent with osteochondromata.
