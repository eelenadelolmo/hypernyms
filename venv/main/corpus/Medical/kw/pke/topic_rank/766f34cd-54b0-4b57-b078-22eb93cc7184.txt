Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease
Imaging characteristics/family history
Known history of polycystic kidney disease with right flank pain.
Sclerosis therapy has proven benefit for relief of symptoms.  This patient had actually received sclerosis therapy of another dominent renal cyst prior to this treatment and experienced excellent relief of pain.  The cyst is localized via ultrasound and a needle is passed into it until urine is aspirated.  A catheter is then exchanged with the needle over a wire. Position is verified with injection of contrast material. The contrast/serous mixture is aspirated and one third of the volume is replaced with ethanol. The patient is then changed in position to coat the cyst. The ethanol is then aspirated.
