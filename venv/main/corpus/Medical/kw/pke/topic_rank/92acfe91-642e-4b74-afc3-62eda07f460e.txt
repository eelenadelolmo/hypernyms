In ED, vitals signs were stable.  
HEENT:  small right temporal cephalohematoma and right hemotympanum and cervical neck tenderness 
Neurological:  unremarkable with the exception of amnesia of the events immediately 
after accident
Non-contrast head CT showed a right temporal fracture, right cephalohematoma and small right subdural hematoma.
Patient was admitted to the ICU for observation.  Complete imaging of the cerivcal spine suggested instability without acute cord injury.  Surgical options were discussed for the instability in the cervical neck.  Since the family was visiting relatives in the area at the time of the accident, they preferred to seek a second opinion from a neurosurgeon closer to the family home.   The patient was discharged with instructions to avoid potential flexion-extension stress activities and advised to use Motrin for pain.
Non-contrast head CT showed a right temporal fracture, right cephalohematoma and small right subdural hematoma.  CT of the cervical spine revealed an incidentalfinding of concern to us.
Image 1 – C-Spine Lateral in Neutral: C1-C2 interspace measured at ~2 mm, odontoid process only extends to inferior level of C1 raising possibility of odontoid hypoplasia, no prevertebral soft tissue swelling, spino-laminar line is intact.
Image 2 – C-Spine Lateral in Extension: C1-C2 interspace measured at ~2 mm 
Image 3 – C-Spine Lateral in Flexion: C1-C2 interspace measured at ~7 mm, bony cortical fragment distal to the odontoid process, the odontoid process is not contiguous with this fragment, loss of normal spino-laminar line at C1-C2 level
Image 4 – C-Spine Lateral:  Bony fragment is better visualized on this lateral projection
Image 5 – Coronal T1: well-corticated bony fragment is seen as a separate entity from the odontoid itself.  Other vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs are normal.    
Image 6 – T1 sagittal:  No abnormality with respect to the spinal cord.  
Image 7 – T2 sagittal FSE:  Separation of bony cortical fragment from C2 vertebral body.  No abnormality with respect to the spinal cord.
Os odontoideum
Odontoid hypoplasia, odontoid fx with non-union, ossiculum terminale, unfused neurocentral synchondrosis, dens pseudarthrosis
13-year-old unhelmeted male who was riding his skateboard and lost controlled going downhill.  He flipped completely and landed on the right parietal region of head.  There was no apparent loss of consciousness per father and patient was moving all extremities.  There was some amnesia for approximately 30 minutes after the event and the patient had difficulty concentrating and demonstrated word perservation.  Patient was taken to Children’s ED and subsequently admitted to the ICU for observation with consultation by Neurosurgery.   His mental status recovered soon after the accident, in which he became more oriented and no longer demonstrated word preservation.  Further history was elicited after the imaging was completed.  Mother remembers that the patient had a previous fall at six years of age where he landed directly on the vertex of this head.  He had severe neck spasms for weeks thereafter, but resolved with physical therapy.
Many times, os odontoideum is diagnosed incidentally after evaluating a patient following a trauma.  Such as this case, an os odontoideum most likely evolves due to a previous fracture of the odontoid synchondrosis before its closure at age five or six years.  

Due to the instability in the C1-C2 measurement, surgical techniques such as, a standard Gallie or Brooks fusion with transarticular screws, were discussed.  Usually a C1-C2 translation of greater than 5 mm is pathologic and requires surgery.  In this patient’s case, his C1-C2 measurement was 7 mm on flexion.
