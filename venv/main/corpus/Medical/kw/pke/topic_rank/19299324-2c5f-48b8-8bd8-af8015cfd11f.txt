IVC filter placed at L2.
Inferior Vena Cava Filters
IVC filter
40 year old male with history of recent pulmonary embolism.  The patient was being anticoagulated on coumadin and had an INR of 2.7.

He subsequently presented to the ER with abdominal pain.  A CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a retroperitoneal bleed.  The patient was taken off coumadin and placed on vitamin K.  A consult was placed with interventional radiology for IVC filter placement.
This patient was a good candidate for a filter, since he had a known PE, but subsequently developed a retroperitoneal bleed while being anticoagulated.
