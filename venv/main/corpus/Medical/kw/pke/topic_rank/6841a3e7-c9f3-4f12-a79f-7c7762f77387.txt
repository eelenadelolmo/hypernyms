Palpable upper abdominal mass.
High dose steroids. Close observation with serial ultrasound to follow natural evolution of tumor. Consideration of resection when patient is older.
Within the right lobe of the liver there is an 8.8x6.9x8.4cm heterogeneous mass, predominantly bright on T2, predominantly dark on T1. The mass demonstrates peripheral enhancement on contrast-enhanced MR and the flow voids of the celiac axis and hepatic artery are enlarged. At CT angiography, the enhancement is peripheral and nodular with centripetal partial fill-in. A large central area of the mass did not enhance on delayed imaging with CR or MR.
Congenital hepatic vascular malformation vs. infantile hemangioendothelioma
• Infantile hemangioendothelioma
• Congenital hepatic vascular malformation
• Pediatric hepatic angiosarcoma
Term baby girl with marked abdominal distension noted at delivery.
Patient presented additionally with thrombocytopenia requiring multiple platelet transfusions while in the NICU.  The constellation of a large vascular tumor and thrombocytopenia secondary to platelet trapping is known as Kasabach-Merritt Syndrome.
