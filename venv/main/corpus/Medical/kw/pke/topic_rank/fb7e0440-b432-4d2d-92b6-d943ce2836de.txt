Given the size of this mass and associated patient's symptoms, selective embolization was attempted, followed by cryo-ablation.
Large right adrenal mass that measures approximately 13 X 14 X 18 cm consisting of predominantly fat attenuation with considerable mass effect on right kidney.
Adrenal Myelolipoma
• myelolipoma
• adrenal adenoma
• retroperitoneal liposarcoma
• pheochromocytoma
• metastatic disease
• lymphoma
• adrenal carcinoma
62 y/o man with right flank pain.
This patient was found to have an incidental right adrenal mass approximately 30 years ago during a laminectomy, and the mass was left alone because of its benign gross anatomical appearance.  The patient began having symptoms to include right flank which instigated further work up to include imaging.

This patient was not an appropriate surgical candidate so interventional radiology was consulted for selective embolization of the mass.  The patient's symptoms persisting after the procedure for several months, and so cryo-ablation was attempted which has resulted in decrease in symptoms.
