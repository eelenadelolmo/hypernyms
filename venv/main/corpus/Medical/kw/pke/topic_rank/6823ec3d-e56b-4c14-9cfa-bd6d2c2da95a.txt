Kidney: Enlarged kidney with mild cortical thinning and increased cortico-medullary differentiation. Hypoechoic medullary pyramids with suggestion of tubular ectasia containing multiple small hyperechoic nonshadowing foci, consistent with calcifications. No cortical cysts. 

Liver: Heterogeneously hyperechoic parenchyma and slightly decreased size. No definite cysts.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
Known disease since birth with extensive liver and kidney involvement.
Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease has variable degrees of involvement of the kidneys and liver, in an inverse relationship.  Infants who present with renal failure due to severe ARPKD have relatively little hepatic fibrosis; at the opposite end of the spectrum, older children may have severe hepatic fibrosis with relatively little renal involvement.  This case is somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, with both renal and hepatic disease demonstrated.
