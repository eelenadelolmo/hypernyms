Tenderness over left mastoid with associated "doughy" edema. Treatment with po antibiotics as outpatient failed to improve pt's Sx.
IV antibiotics
Coalescent mastoiditis with destruction and erosion of mastoid septa in several places.  There is also fluid opacifying many left mastoid air cells.
Coalescent Mastoiditis without sub-periosteal abscess
Acute Mastoiditis
Glomus Jugulare Tumor
Metastatic disease
Several days of fever, chills and left ear pain
This represents a more advanced stage along the spectrum of mastoiditis. Acute otomastoiditis with fluid present but no septal erosion is the most common and least severe entitiy.  In this case there is erosion of the internal boney margin of mastoid bone which forms the lateral aspect of the posterior crainial fossa. If allowed to progress sub-periosteal abscess, petrous apicitis or even brain abscess may ensue. Aggressive treatment possibly including drainage  with mastoidectomy may be necessary to prevent progression.
