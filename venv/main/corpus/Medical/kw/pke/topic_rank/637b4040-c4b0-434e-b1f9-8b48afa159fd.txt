Patient presented to ED with GCS of 12, no focal neurologic findings, as well as multiple abrasions and minor lacerations on all extremeties and the face.
Patient should be stabilized with Halo for three months.
Selected axial CT images in bone window show multiple fractures of C1 including bilateral anteriolateral fractures with no displacement of left lateral mass and moderate displacement of the right lateral mass best visualized on the coronal reformatted images.  There is also a comminuted fracture in the right posteriolateral portion of the c1 ring with a small, triangular fragment abutting, but not compromising the thecal sac.
Jefferson Fracture
Fracture
27 year old female involved in high speed motor vehicle accident.
Multiple C1 ring fractures, otherwise known as Jefferson fractures,account for 10% of all cervical spine injuries and 25% of alantoaxial injuries and result from a significant axial force directed from vertex through occiput such as diving in shallow water or in this case a motor vehicle accident.  The C1 ring much like the pelvic ring will not typically fracture in one place.  Multiple fracture points allow displacement of the lateral masses usually seen on the AP open mouth view of the c-spine series.  Although plain films are routinely used in evaluation of the trauma patient, anyone suspected to have disruption of the C1 or other cervical vertebrae should undergo CT evaulation.  Plain film criteria for diagnosis of Jefferson fracture states that the C1 lateral masses must be displaced greater than 2mm and must extend beyond the margins of C2.   CT is used to better define the fracture fragments and to determine any compromise of the spinal cord.
