Clinical features consistent with Morquio-Brailsford disease.
Limited skeletal survey (lateral C-spine, lower thorax/abdomen/pelvis, hips, and shoulder) demonstrates severe osteopenia, odontoid hypoplasia, platyspondylia in association with irregularity of the vertebral end plates, thoracolumbar scolisosis, "canoe-paddle" appearance of the ribs, narrowing of the bodies and flaring of the wings of the ileum producing a "wine-glass" appearance of the pelvis, and dysplastic hips.

Secondary degenenerative changes of joints, post-surgical changes with occipito-cervical fusion, and bilateral hip dislocations are also present.
Morquio-Brailsford Disease.
>>Other entities that have a general affect on the skeleton including other mucopolysacharidoses such as Hurler syndrome.

>>When predominantly affecting the spine, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia.
>>When predominantly affecting the hips, Legg-Calves-Perthes disease.
>>When predominantly affecting joints, epiphyseal dysplasia.
52 year old female with a known history of Morquio-Brailsford disease.
1. A patient with Morquio-Brailsford disease with characteristic radiographic findings.  
2. Demonstration of complications of this disease, for those patients who live into adulthood, such as spinal fusion presumably relative to cervical instability, dislocated hips secondary to hip dysplasia, and degenerative joint disease.
