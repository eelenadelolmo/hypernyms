•  Treatment Options:
»  1.  Orthopaedic surgery referral
»  2.  Conservative treatment with activity restriction, monitored NSAID/anti-inflammatory use, therapeutic exercises, and clotting factor replacement on demand.
»  3.  Intra-articular corticosteroid injection for the inflammatory synovitis component of the disorder.
»  4.  Synoviorthesis/radionuclide synovectomy.  This procedure entails radiosynovectomy with Phosphorus 32-sulfer colloid (P32 or 32P).  It is a relatively inexpensive outpatient injection procedure that is effective and associated with a very low rate of complications.
»  5.  Surgical treatment (in conjunction with factor replacement therapy):
»»  a.  Surgical synovectomy (especially useful in young patients)
»»  b.  Joint debridement
»»  c.  Arthrodesis procedures (where appropriate)
»»  d.  Partial or total arthroplasties when indicated

•  Prognosis:   Patients tend to have progressive degenerative and inflammatory arthritis with eventual destruction and fibrosis of the involved joints leading to deformity and crippling.  Severity may be decreased with surgical and non-surgical treatment options.  It is usually suggested that total arthroplasties should be the last option for treatment due to the limited lifespan of orthopaedic implants.
•  Left Elbow:
  »  Abnormal narrowing of the elbow joint at the humeral radial and humeral ulnar articulations.
  »  Sclerosis and bony irregularity along the cortical surfaces.
  »  Broadening of the radial head.
  »  Mild elevation of the posterior fat pad consistent with synovial thickening.
  »  A supracondylar process is present as an incidental finding.


•  Bilateral Ankles:
  »  Osteopenia of the distal talus and distal fibula bilaterally with bony overgrowth.
  »  Extensive degenerative changes at the tibiotalar joint.
  »  Geodes are present in the left distal tibia.
  »  The degenerative changes appear worse on the right in comparison to the left


•  Right Wrist:
  »  Joint space narrowing between the lunate and the capitate.
Hemophilic Polyarthritis
•  Differential diagnosis based on radiographic findings:
»  1.  Hemophilic polyarthritis
»  2.  Rheumatoid arthritis
»  3.  Pigmented villonodular synovitis
»  4.  Osteoarthritis
»  5.  Hemosiderotic synovitis
»  6.  Arthritic changes secondary to a neuromuscular condition
This patient is a 41 year-old male with a history of Hemophilia A, hepatitis C, and HIV.  The patient also has a history of chronic left elbow and bilateral ankle pain.  He is considering applying for disability and requested radiographic evaluation.  He is on infusion prophylaxis with Refacto q.o.d.  He is a manager for numerous Christian radio stations and has taken on part-time Pastor duties at his church.
