Surgical Removal; patient did well with no recurrence
The CT images reveal an expansile calcified mass arising in the right third mandibular molar.  The mass has attenuation components suggestive of enamel, dentin, cementum, and pulp in a haphazard arrangement.  There is a thin radiolucent halo surrounding the mass.

Compound Odontoma
Fibrous Dysplasia
Right jaw mass noted at a routine dental visit.  The child has no symptoms.
CT findings are suggestive of a complex odontoma.  An odontoma is a type of odontogenic tumor that most often in the second decade of life (95% of cases), and 75% occur in the maxilla.  If the tumor components are more orderly arranged, the tumor is called a compound odontoma.  All odontomas are surrounded by a thin radiolucent halo that represents a fibrous capsule.  Treatment involves complete surgical excision, and recurrences are rare.
