66 yo female status post placement of a right ureteral stent to treat right hydronephrosis and hydroureter secondary to extrinsic compression by a retroperitoneal mass
This is an interesting case of a large mass predominately involving the IVC.  Statistically this is likely an MFH, with a liposarcoma an leiomyosarcoma less likely, given the absence of fat.  Angiosarcoma, while extremely rare, is an interesting possibility.  The patient was just diagnosed with the mass and is awaiting biopsy.
