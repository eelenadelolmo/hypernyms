Physical exam reveals a feverish young woman with mild stridor and tenderness to palpation at the anterior neck.
Treatment is supportive with antibiotics and close follow up for this mild case.  More severe cases may need emergent intubation to prevent airway compromise.  Such patients should be monitored and/or escorted while in the radiology department to ensure that immediate care is available to restore the airway if necessary.
The lateral radiograph of the neck demonstrates a thickened epiglottis with edematous surrounding soft tissues.
