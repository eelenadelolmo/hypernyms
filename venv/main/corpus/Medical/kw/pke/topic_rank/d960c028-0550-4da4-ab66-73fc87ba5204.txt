Afebrile.  Numerous prominent tortuous tubular structures ("bag of worms") are felt during palpation of the left spermatic cord.  No scrotal skin defects are identified.  No urethral discharge or lymphadenopathy.
None required, however, embolization or surgical ligation can be considered if there is a history of pain or undesired infertility.
Static gray scale sonographic images demonstrate multiple left peritesticular small, rounded and tubular structures that communicate with each other (appreciated on real-time cine images) consistent with dilated peristesticular veins.  Most of these structures are approximately 3 mm in diameter.  Color flow Doppler images demonstrate augmented venous flow during Valsalva maneuver.
