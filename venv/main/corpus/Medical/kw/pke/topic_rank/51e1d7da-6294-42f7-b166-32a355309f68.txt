Vital signs stable
Male genitalia: normal circumsized penis, 20cc right testicle, 15cc left testicle tender to palpation, no palpable masses
Otherwise unremarkable physical exam
The patient was taken to the OR semi-emergently for a left testicular mass and had a left inguinal orchiectomy. Pre-operative tumor marker levels revealed: AFP=3.2, beta-hCG=<0.1, LDH=393 (all within normal limits). He did well post-operatively and had a negative metastatic work-up.
Transverse image through both testicles reveals a small left testicle (when compared to the right) and numerous small, intratesticular, foci of increased echotexture consistent with bilateral testicular microlithiasis. Longitudinal images reveal two hypoechoic masses with irregular margins and visible Doppler flow within the left testicle.
