Texto: 
Normal colonoscopy, EGD, HIDA, and Right upper quadrant ultrasound.
Embolization
Chest radiograph: 
demonstrates an opacity (mass) in left lower lobe.

CT: 
demonstrates mass in left lower lobe that follows bronchovascular structures.  On coronal reformatted images a single artery and vein can be demonstrated.
Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformation (PAVM)
• pulmonary arteriovenous malformation
• carcinoma
• metastasis
40 y.o. man with right sided abdominal pain - no chest symptoms

Etiology: congenital defect, acquired (cirrhosis, cancer, trauma, iatrogenic, infection).
Location: Lower lobes > middle > upper lobes. Often subpleural as in this case. 
Change in size with Valsalva.
Single: with a single pulmonary artery to pulmonary vein communication, usually aneurysmal and nonseptate.  
Complex: more than one feeding arteries and draining veins, usually septate aneurysmal communication between arteries and veins.
Determination of single or complex important in consideration of embolization. 

30-50% of pts with PAVM have Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.)  Association is higher with multiple pulmonary AVMs.

Complications: normal pulmonary capillary bed bypassed - pulmonary to systemic (R-L) shunt, cerebrovascular ischemia, brain abscesses, rupture with hemothorax or hemoptysis.
