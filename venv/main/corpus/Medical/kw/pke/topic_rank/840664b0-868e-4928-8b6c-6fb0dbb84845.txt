Pneumothorax-a small pneumothorax such as this should be reabsorbed with a matter of days. Larger pneumothoraces may take 2-4 weeks if the defect allowing air into the pleural space is not renewed. In the absence of marked thickening of pluera or pulmonary fibrosis, delayed absorption should suggest the possibility of bronchial obstruction (e.g.mucus plug). Etilogies of a pneumothorax are numerous, frequently iatrogenic from the retroperitoneal area.
Pneumomediastinum-can be caused by a surgical procedure in the retroperitoneal area with cephalad migration of air along contiguous fascial planes. Pneumomediastinum occurs frequently following diagnostic retroperitoneal air insufflation. It can also result from a pneumoperitoneum. Air may be introduced inadvertantly into the properitoneal tissue or it may enter this plane by seepage from the peritoneal cavity.The air in the properitoneal region courses upward deep to the abdominal muscles and between the diaghragm and the parietal peritoneum which covers its undersurface. From here, it may enter the mediastinum through one of the natural openings in the diaphragm.
