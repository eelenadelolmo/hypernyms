Treatment is usually conservative (rest, ice, elevation, compression), analgesics/NSAIDS, and 4-8 weeks of decreased activity and potentially with splinting.
MR shows a focal, tubular shaped fluid collection (T1 low and T2 high signal intensity) between the soleus muscle and the medial head of the gastrocnemius.
