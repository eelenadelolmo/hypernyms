Drop in the patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit from 9.1/26.7 to 5.9/17.4 within a 24 hour period and the development of a palpable left sided tender adbominal mass.  Just prior to her CT scan, while receiving heparin, the patient's PT was 18.3 (nml 11-13.8), PTT was 133.7 (23.8-35.5), PT ratio 1.5, INR 2.0.
Temporary withdrawal of anticoagulation.
Non contrast CT of the abdomen and the pelvis demonstrates a large hyperdense heterogeneous mass at the left lateral abdominal wall, not present on a prior CT of the abdomen from less than a week prior.
Abdominal wall hematoma following the initiation of therapeutic anticoagultion.
Acute hemorrhage/hematoma
Abscess
Soft tissue neoplasm
56 year old female patient in the intensive care unit found to have a sudden drop in her hemoglobin and hematocrit following the recent initiation of anticoagulation therapy for a pulmonary embolus.
This patient was being started on anticoagulation therapy for a recent pulmonary embolism with intravenous heparin.  Her PTT was elevated at 133.7, which falls beyond the goal of 70-90 (by this institution's laboratory) for a patient starting anticoagulation.  Unfortunately patients starting herparin therapy often overshoot their goal PTT values during their initial titration.
