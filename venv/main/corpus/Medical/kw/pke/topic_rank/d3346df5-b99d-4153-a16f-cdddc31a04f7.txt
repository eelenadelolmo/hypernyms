On CT, there is marked and diffuse volume loss, ex vacuole dilatation of the ventricles, and cystic changes of the basal ganglia, cerebellum and thalami.
Follow-up MR again reveals diffuse parenchymal atrophy with cystic degeneration of cerebellum, cerebral peduncles, thalami and the basal ganglia. On spectroscopy, there is a significant depression of the NAA peak with a resultant increase in the choline peak. Lactate is also present.
Leigh's disease (subacute necrotizing encephalopathy).
Profound perinatal asphyxia
Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes (MELAS)
