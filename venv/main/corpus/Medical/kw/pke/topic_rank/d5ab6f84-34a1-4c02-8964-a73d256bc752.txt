Blunt splenic trauma requiring embolization of the splenic artery
pathognomonic with history
Young soldier transferred from Iraq after sustaining moderate chest and head injuries in a motor vehicle accident showed a marked hematocrit drop on routine morning blood work.  Patient was subsequently transfused 2 units of PRBC's with a stabilized hematocrit over 12 hours.
This injury was unknown until a markedly decreased hematocrit prompted a CT scan.  This represents a delayed splenic rupture.
