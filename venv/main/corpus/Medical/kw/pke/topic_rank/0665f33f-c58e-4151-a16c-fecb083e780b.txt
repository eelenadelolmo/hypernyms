• Initially, protected weight bearing
• Advanced- surgical intervention (arthoscopic debridement, core decompression, high tibial osteotomy, drilling with or without bone grafting, osteochondral allografts, total knee arthroplasty)
Radiographs demonstrate an area of subchondral collapse with subchondral sclerosis in the weight bearing surface of the left lateral femoral condyle.  MRI further illustrates osteonecrotic focus (low T1 and low T2 signal) with surrounding edema.  Early in the disease process, some degree of T2 and PD hyperintensity can be seen.  Also, surrounding edema can sometimes mask areas of subchondral sclerosis.
Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee
•Spontaneous Osteonecrosis of the knee
•Osteochondritis dissecans
• Meniscal Tear
• Stress fracture
72 year old female with knee pain.
Imaging features, as above, are consistent with advanced Spontaneous Osteonecrosis of the Knee (SONK).  There was no history of steroid use, SLE, renal transplantation, alcoholism or hemoglobinopathy.  Classically, the weight bearing surface of the medial femoral condyle is involved.  In this case, the lateral femoral condyle is affected.
