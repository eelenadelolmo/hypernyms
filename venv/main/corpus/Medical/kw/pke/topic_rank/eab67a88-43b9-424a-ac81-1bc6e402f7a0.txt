Treat seizures. Surgical excision of affected lobes may be required in refractory cases.
Head CT and brain MR images reveal gyriform calcification over the right cerebral cortex.  MR findings demonstrate gyriform signal loss suggestive of calcification in association with leptomeningeal enhancement and ipsilateral choroid plexus enlargement.

17-year-old boy with seizure disorder.
Sturge Weber syndrome (aka encephalotrigeminal angiomatosisis) one the phakomatoses with skin, CNS, and ocular involvement.  

The classic clinical symptoms include seizures (90%), contralateral hemiparesis (30%-66%), hemisensory defect, and developmental delay (>40% if seizures present); association with subarachnoid hemorrhage is rare.   A facial nevus ("port-wine stain") can be seen with V1/V2 distribution and is present at birth. Homonymous hemianopsia seen in 2%.

Classic imaging findings can include cortical calcifications (“tram track”), ipsilateral hemiatrophy with cortical and white matter gliosis, leptomeningeal angiomatosis (ipsilateral in 80%), and an enlarged enhancing ipsilateral choroid plexus.  Ipsilateral cerebral atrophy with "gyriform" cortical calcification usually worsens as the disease progresses. Choroidal angiomas present in 70% of cases.

This disorder is thought to result from a defect in neural crest precursor cells which result in abnormal venous drainage in the meninges, globe, and dermis.

Typically the occipital lobes are affected first, and most severely; however, the disease may also involve the parietal and temporal lobes, and the frontal lobes. Midbrain and cerebellum are rarely involved.

Associated disorders include Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome and neuronal migration anomalies (polymicrogryia, pachygyria, and lissencephaly).
