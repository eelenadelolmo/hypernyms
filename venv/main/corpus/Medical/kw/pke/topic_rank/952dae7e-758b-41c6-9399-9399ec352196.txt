Unremarkable. No wheezing or stridor.
Child was referred to ENT for removal of foreign body.
There is a disc shaped metallic foreign body that is round on frontal projection and oval on the lateral projection.  The disc is localized to the region of the esophagus on the lateral view. The mediastinum is otherwise within normal limits. The lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax. Abdominal bowel gas pattern is normal. Visualized osseous and remaining soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
Esophageal Foreign Body - Coin Ingestion
• Esophageal Foreign Body
• Tracheal Foreign Body
• External Attenuator
10-month-old girl gagged on something last night.  The patient's mother says the little girl is feeling well, but is more 'fussy'.  No symptoms of respiratory distress.
Although the appearance on the frontal image is classic for a coin ingestion with esophageal localization, 2 views are necessary to confirm and determine that coin is not in the trachea, nor external to the patient.
