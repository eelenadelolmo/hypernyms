Multiple MR images demonstrate a dumb-bell-shaped mass at the level of the left jugular foramen, fairly isointense to brain on both T1 and T2 weighted images, which demonstrate homogeneous enhancement on T1-weighted images obtained after the IV administration of gadolinium-DTPA contrast material.  It has mass effect on the underlying medulla.  It also has thickened, enhancing, "dural tail."

Non-contrast CT images demonstrate fairly diffuse calcification throughout the mass.
jugular foramen mass (unknown; patient underwent surgery and we are awaiting the results of pathologic evaluation)
meningioma
nerve sheath tumor (schwannoma)
less likely:
paraganglioma
metastatic disease
lymphoma
