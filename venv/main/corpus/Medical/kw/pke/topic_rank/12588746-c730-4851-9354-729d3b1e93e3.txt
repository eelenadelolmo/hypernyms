Four year old boy with 4 day history of sore throat, worse in the last 24 hours.  Difficulty swallowing, poor appetite.  Parents noticed the patient slobbering for the past several hours prior to ED admission.
Retropharyngeal abcess formation occurs most commonly in infants and children up to age 14.  The abcess may result from pharyngitis (as in this case), pharyngeal trauma, or dental infection.  Clinical findings include hyperextension of the neck, gurgling respirations, and puddling of saliva.  Complications include rupture with subsequent aspiration and contiguous extension into the posterior mediastinum and lateral pharyngeal space.  Typically polymicrobial, the most common causitive bacteria include Strep. pyogenes, Group C Beta-Hemolytic Strep., and Staph. Aureus.
