Texto: 
Tenderness to palpation along the medial aspect of the heel. Increased pain with dorsiflexion of toes. No ecchymosis, edema, or evidence of bony abnormality upon examination of the right foot. Sensation intact to light touch in all distributions. PT and DP pulses 2+ in right extremity. 

Labs within normal limits
Conservative (rest from strenuous physical activity and NSAIDs x 2-3 weeks)
Plain film (07/09) of right foot demonstrated no evidence of acute fracture to calcaneus, tarsal bones, or other osseous structures. A calcaneal enthesophyte was noted on the lateral film (see image). An MRI performed on 01/12/2010 demonstrated mild thickening at the calcaneal attachment of the plantar fascia. There was also increased signal involving the proximal fascia and T2 signal abnormality of the adjacent plantar calcaneal tuberosity with a mild amount of perifascial edema around the proximal attachment point of the plantar fascia. There was no evidence of fracture, AVM, or other intraosseous destructive lesion. There was no evidence of structural damage or signal abnormality within the mid and distal portions of the plantar fascia. The flexor, Achilles and peroneal tendons were intact with no evidence of tenosynovitis or signal abnormality. The deltoid and lateral ligamentous complexes as well as the sinus tarsi were unremarkable. There were no soft tissue abnormalities identified, and vessels demonstrated normal flow voids.
Plantar fasciitis
(1) plantar fasciitis- clinical finding of persistent heel pain correlated with MRI findings are most consistent with this diagnosis. (2) plantar fascia rupture- pain is usually of more acute onset and generally follows physical activity. There may be loss of arch height on physical exam as well as swelling and ecchymosis. (3) nerve entrapment- the entrapment of the posterior tibial nerve or its branches can cause pain and paresthesia on the sole of the foot. (4) calcaneal stress fracture or infection- bone pain arising from the calcaneus may be exacerbated by physical activity and usually worsens at night. A sudden increase in physical activity would support the diagnosis of stress fracture, and would best be demonstrated by MRI, while infection could be demonstrated by plain films. (5) tendinitis- The posterior tibialis or flexor digitorum longus tendons could develop a tendinitis that would present with insidious pain and tenderness along the course of these tendons.
This is a 42 year-old gentleman who presented to the sports medicine outpatient clinic with persistent right heel pain. The heel pain increases with activity and is alleviated with rest. The patient initially presented to the outpatient clinic six months ago with exacerbation of foot pain s/p fall. No history of other trauma or injury to right foot, including fracture or soft tissue injury.
The patient presented with a history of right heel and foot pain that had persisted since a fall six months prior to the current visit. The pain was localized to the heel although there is no mention of point tenderness on physical exam. There is also no mention of any other significant findings on physical exam including ecchymosis, edema, or gross bony deformities. Although the differential diagnosis for heel pain is broad, the clinical presentation and imaging studies in this patient are most consistent with plantar fasciitis.
