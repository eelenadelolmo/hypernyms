General:  appeared unresponsive
Vitals:  temp. 98, pulse 120, resp. 22, BP 122/77, O2 sat. 98%
HEENT:  hematoma over left occipital region, pupils 3-4 mm and reactive
Neuro:  unresponsive, some non-purposeful movement of the upper extremities, DTRs 2+ bilaterally
Skin:  multiple abrasions on left shoulder, flank, and hip
C5-6 laminotomy with laminaplasty, intradural exploration and resection of the lipomatous mass.
-Head CT without contrast: no intracranial bleed, no subdural or epidural hematoma, no skull fracture
-C-spine: no fracture or dislocation
-CT of cervical spine:  fluid collection in the spinal canal
-MRI of the cervical spine with and without contrast:  3 cm intradural extra-axial mass posterior to the spinal cord C3-7.  Water signal on T2.  Centrally located with no apparent impingement on one side of the cord more than the other side.  Mild Chiari malformation associated with a slight mega cisterna magna.
-Pelvis and abdomen CT with contrast:  no evidence of acute abdominal trauma

The patient is an 11 y/o boy who presented to the ED after falling from a vehicle going about 20 mph and sustaining a head injury.  Possible seizure activity was witnessed from a bystander and he was incontinent of urine.  He was conscious at first, but later became less responsive and eventually was not responsive to pain stimuli.  The CT scan and C-spine were negative.  His Glasgow Coma score was 5 and he was intubated.  He was admitted for possible closed head injury/cerebral contusion.  A CT of the spine later revealed an incidental mass posterior to the spinal cord C3-7.  
Past medical history reveals a minor complaint of some numbness of the right hand with prolonged writing.  He was otherwise in good health.
This case represents a common tumor (lipoma) in a rare location, within the dura of the spinal canal.  Intradural lipomas represent only 1% of spinal cord neoplasms.  The CSF space above and below the mass is widened which indicates that the mass is contained within the dura.  In a similar case report by Shen et al (see factoid references), the tumor had high signal intensity on T1 and T2 images.  On contrast enhanced images with fat suppression, the intensity dropped significantly.  This indicated that fat was the predominant component and it also made the diagnosis of a hematoma less likely.  A myelogram would reveal widening of the spinal canal with obstruction of contrast flow.  The MRI is the study of choice because it confirms the fat component and helps delineate adjacent structures. Sensitivity of imaging modalities is high although the definite diagnosis is made after surgical removal.  

Intradural lipomas usually occur in young adults in the second to third decade.  They occur equally in males and females.  The clinical course is slow, but progressive.  Upper thoracic and cervicothoracic are the most common levels.  A review of 99 cases of intradural spinal lipomas by Giuffre (see factoid references) revealed that only 12% were confined to the cervical region.  They are most often at the posterior aspect and may cause numbness or ataxia of the extremities.  In this case the patient did report some numbness of the right hand with prolonged writing.
