No treatments have been found that slow the progression of cyst development in ADPKD. Treatments target associated complications, such as antihypertensive therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARBs) for elevated blood pressure, slowing development of left ventricular hypertrophy, and preserving renal function,(1) and identification and treatment of possible UTI and nephrolithiasis. Follow-up includes US of the kidneys every 1-2 years.(2)

ADPKD is a genetic disorder defined by growth of multiple renal cysts that result in kidney destruction and renal failure. The hereditary abnormality is a defect in one of two genes: polycystin 1 PKD1) and  polycystin 2 (PKD2), which are thought to be important in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions involved in tubular epithelial cell growth.(3)

Renal manifestations of ADPKD
ADPKD manifests as progressive renal failure secondary to cyst enlargement. Volume progression in polycystic kidney disease has been evaluated in a recent study that measured the correlation between mean total kidney volume and cyst volumes as measured by MRI over a three-year period and iothalamate clearance as a measure of kidney function. The study found that a baseline total kidney volume greater than 1500 mL is a predictor of declining glomerular filtration rate. Furthermore, growth of kidney size occurs at the same rate bilaterally, and is directly proportional to growth of cysts.(4)  
Renal complications include hypertension, UTI, defects in concentrating ability, hematuria, nephrolithiasis, and possible renal cell carcinoma. Flank or abdominal pain is possible and can be due to infection, nephrolithiasis, cyst hemorrhage or torsion, and associated liver complications of polycystic liver enlargement.  Proteinuria is not a major feature of ADPKD. Renal cell carcinoma does not occur at increased frequency from that in the general population, but is more likely to present with fever and bilateral tumor.(5) 

Extrarenal manifestations
Extrarenal manifestations of ADPKD include cerebral aneurysms, hepatic cysts, cardiac valve disease, colonic diverticula, and abdominal wall and inguinal hernias.
Cerebral aneurysms are the most serious complication, though rarely manifest. The incidence increases with age and is between 4 and 10%; furthermore, the risk of rupture of aneurysms < 7 mm is low in patients with no preceding rupture. Procedures of choice for screening for cerebral aneurysms are CT angiography and MRA. However, both these tests carry risks: gadolinium during MRI has a strong association with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in PKD patients with moderate/severe disease, especially if they are on dialysis. On the other hand, cerebral angiography is associated with increased risk of cerebral bleed or stroke.(6) Hence, due to the low incidence and risk of rupture and adverse effects associated with screening, the current recommendation is to screen only in high-risk patients (including those with family history of aneurysm/stroke, those with symptoms such as new-onset headache or neurologic defect,(7)  and those on anticoagulant therapy), and perform intermittent follow-up imaging in patients with found aneurysms until the stability of the size of the aneurysm(s) has been determined.(6)
Hepatic cysts are common in patients with ADPKD: >80% of pts with ADPKD have liver cysts.7 The prevalence and volume of liver cysts has been found to be proportional to the volume of the kidneys. However, the cysts are usually asymptomatic, albeit rarely cause pain and/or infection. (6)
Other manifestations of ADPKD include cardiac complications, such as valvular abnormalities (especially mild mitral valve prolapsed and aortic regurgitation), likely due to the collagen and extracellular matrix defects associated with the disease, and colonic diverticula and abdominal wall and inguinal hernias.(6)

Screening
Screening for kidney cysts
Ultrasound is the screening test of choice due to cost and safety considerations 1 and can detect cysts > 1 cm. MRI can also detect presence of cysts as small as 3 mm, appearing as “black holes interspersed on a blanket of bright parenchyma” on T¬1 weighted imaging and as bright areas on T2 weighted MRI.(7)
Ultrasound criteria for the diagnosis of PKD in patients with unknown genotype have been proposed. Diagnosis of PKD can be made if three or more renal cysts are present in 15-39 yo patients, two or more cysts in each kidney in 40-59 yo patients, and four or more cysts in each kidney in patients over 60 yo. Fewer than two cysts in patients over 40 yo who are at risk excludes diagnosis of PKD.(8) These criteria have sensitivity close to 100% in patients &#8805;30 yo and for younger patients with mutation of PKD1 as well as 67% for younger patients with mutation of PKD2. It is important to note that the above criteria are applicable to ultrasound but not CT or MRI, as these latter modalities have higher sensitivity than does ultrasound.(1) 
Genetic testing is possible but reserved for inconclusive imaging or testing of a younger patient, such as a potential living related kidney donor.(1) 

Screening for hepatic cysts
Different imaging modalities are used to detect complications of liver involvement in ADPKD. MRI detects complicated liver cysts, while CT scan can show signs of infection, including “fluid-debris concentrations within cysts, cyst wall thickening, intracystic gas bubbles, and heterogeneous or increased density,” with diagnosis made using radionuclide imaging and 18-F fluorodoxyglucose PET.(1) 

Screening for brain aneurysms
As discussed above, screening for brain aneurysms is only done in the select cases of high-risk patients.
