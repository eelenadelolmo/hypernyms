Amorphous calcification along the gluteus minimus and gluteus medius tendons near their insertion on the greater trochanter of the left femur.
Similar calcification is also seen along the gluteus minimus tendon on the right.
Calcific Tendonitis
Although remote trauma could be considered in the differential, this finding is very suggestive of calcific tendonitis.
54 year old female complains of several months of left hip pain, exacerbated with walking up hills or stairs.
As discussed above, the most common location for this process is in the rotator cuff.  This is a nice demonstration of the disease process as well as a good anatomic correlate of the gluteus muscles and their insertions.
