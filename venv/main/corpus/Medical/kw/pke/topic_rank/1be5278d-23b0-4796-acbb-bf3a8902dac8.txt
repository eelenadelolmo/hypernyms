Well developed, well nourished male in no apparent distress.  Facial asymmetry noted due to a left peripheral VII nerve palsy.  Motor response for facial nerve was 1/6 on left and 6/6 on right.  No twitching or synkinesis.  He had flicker movement. Facial sensation was intact. Hearing was intact bilaterally and symmetric to finger rub.  Auricle, EAC, and TM were normal bilaterally.  Left sclera appeared injected.  Unable to close left eye.  Extraocular motility was full. Slowness of left shoulder elevation compared to right.  Otherwise full and symmetric strength throughout.  Gait and station were stable.  Normal muscle tone and bulk.  Skin was warm and dry.  Coordination was symmetric.  Mental status was normal.
Patient underwent removal of the hemangioma via MCF (middle cranial fossa) approach with abdominal fat and sural nerve grafts.  Three biopsies were sent to anatomic pathology and were consistent with hemangioma.
CT Findings
o     T-bone CT
          - Poorly marginated lesion with amorphous, intratumoral bony spicules, know as the “honeycomb” appearance, is a distinctive imaging finding of facial hemangiomas.
          - This finding is seen in 100% of larger lesions
          - Enlargement of facial nerve canal is often present
o     CT with contrast
          - No role
MR Findings
o     T1WI
          - Mixed signal lesion with foci of low signal within lesion matrix
o     T2WI
          - High signal lesion with foci of low signal within lesion matrix
o     T1C+
          - Avid enhancing lesion in the left geniculate ganglion.         
          - Perineural spread along proximal facial nerve may be present.
          - May extend a few millimeters in either direction
          - If in fundus of IAC, may mimic vestibular schwannoma
          - Ovoid, well-demarcated, enhancing mass
Facial Nerve Hemangioma
• Facial hemangioma
     • Facial schwannoma
     • Cholesteatoma
     • Tumor (non-specific)    
Hemangiomas may be distinguished from cholesteatomas and schwannomas, as the former do not enhance with gadolinium and the latter are more sharply-defined.
46 year-old male with sudden left sided facial weakness and left eye exposure requiring artificial tears and ointment for five months.  He denies hearing loss, vertigo, drainage, or pain.
