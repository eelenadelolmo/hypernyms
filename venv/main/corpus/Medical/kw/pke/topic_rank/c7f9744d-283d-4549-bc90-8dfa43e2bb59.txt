Plain film: Suggestion of patchy sclerotic density of the right femoral head when compared to the left in addition to a subtle subchondral lucency consistent with a "cresent sign" particularly of the frog leg radiograph

Recommendation of MRI for further evaluation given concern for AVN

MRI: Focal area of abnormal signal intensity at weight-bearing (antero-lateral)portion of the femoral head, and low signal intensity surrounding a curvilinear area of high signal intensity (double line sign)
Avascular necrosis of the femoral head
Findings consistent with avascular necrosis of the femoral head with mild cortical compression fx (collapse)
25 year old active duty soldier with inability to bear weight on right lower extremity secondary to right hip pain
