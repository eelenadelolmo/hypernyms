Abdomen: non-distended.  NABS, no bruits.  Non tender.  No abdominal masses palpated.
Back: No CVA tenderness
Labs: BUN/creat performed at outside institution, WNL
A urinary bladder wash demonstrated cells consistent with TCC.  The mass was successfully resected, and the surgical specimen demonstrated low grade papillary urothelial carcinoma without invasion into underlying muscle layers.  The patient's recovery was uneventful.
Axial CT images of pelvis without contrast demonstrating an intravesicular mass with coarse border adjacent to right wall of bladder, with slightly increased attenuation relative to lumen contents.  Small calcifications visible along periphery of lesion.

Post-contrast axial CT images of pelvis in late excretory phase demonstrating a 3.8 x 3.4 cm homogeneously enhancing mass with a well circumscribed but coarse border.  Mass does not extend outside bladder lumen.
Low grade, non invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma.
-Malignant neoplasm (transitional cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, metastases)
-Benign neoplasm (leiomyoma, fibroepithelial polyp, adenoma, hemangioma)
-Blood clot
-Fungus ball
65 year-old male with one week history of gross hematuria.  Denies flank or abdominal pain.  No dysuria or polyuria.  No history of nephrolithiasis.
Though the mass is difficult to discern on the pre-contrast images, calicifactions are seen, which cannot be explained by urine sediment as they do not layer out within the bladder.  Further evaluation with post-contrast images allow one to better appreciate the mass itself.
