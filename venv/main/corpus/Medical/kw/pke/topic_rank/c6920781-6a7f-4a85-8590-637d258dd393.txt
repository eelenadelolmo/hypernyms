Focally tender over the mid right anterior abdominal wall.
Temperature 100.6 F
WBC 14k
The patient underwent emergent appendectomy.
Axial CT images from the mid abdomen following oral and intravenous contrast material administration demonstrate a blind-ending loop of bowel arising from the cecum directed superiorly with the tip just inferior to the inferior margin of the liver.  The bowel loop is not filled with contrast and measures 1.3 cm from outer wall to outer wall in diameter.  There is some associated inflammatory infiltration of the mesentary and a small amount of perinephric fluid anterior to the right kidney.  There is no free air or abnormal fluid collections to suggest abscess formation.
Acute appendicitis
Acute appendicitis
17 year old female presented to the emergency room with a 12 hour history of abdominal pain that began in her periumbilical region and progressed to the right mid abdomen.
Note the location of the appendix in this case (directed anteriorly in the right abdomen), which might explain why this patient's pain was not at the "classical" location for acute appendicitis (McBurney's Point).
