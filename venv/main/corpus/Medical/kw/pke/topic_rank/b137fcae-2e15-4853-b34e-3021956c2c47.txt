Patient without symptoms.
Patient seen in vascular surgery for preop assessment, where best surgical approach (open vs. endovascular) will be decided.
A 4.5cm x 2cm fusiform aneurysm of the celiac artery located 1cm from the origin with extensive mural thrombus just distal to the aneurysm.
Celiac Artery Aneurysm
celiac artery aneurysm
infected/inflammatory celiac artery aneurysm
fistula formation between celiac artery and other lumens
72 yo man with celiac aneurysm noted on screening virtual colonography.
This patient's imaging shows no sign of inflammatory aneurysm, an encasement of the aneurysm by inflammation that often results in chronic abdominal pain, elevated ESR, and dense adherence of the surrounding viscera.  Radiographic findings that increase the suspicion of an infected aneurysm are saccular shape (94% of infected aneurysms), lobulated contour, stranding or fluid around the vessel, and rapid progression on sequential imaging.  Associated mural thrombus also increases the risk for an infected aneurysm.   
Celiac artery aneurysms are rare (4-6% of visceral aneurysms), and 2 cm is often the size at which intervention will be recommended.  While open reconstructive aneurysmectomy has had a longer history of success, newer endovascular techniques have been gaining ground in recent years.
