Follow-up CT in 6 months and correlation with laboratory values to ensure no evidence of hyperfunction.
An unenhanced axial CT image through the upper abdomen demonstrates an incidentally noted round, homogeneous noncalcified mass arising from the right adrenal gland.  The Hounsfield units within this right adrenal mass measured 7, consistent its representing a lipid-rich adenoma.
Adrenal Adenoma
Differential Diagnosis of an Adrenal Mass:
Adrenal adenoma
Adrenal carcinoma
Pheochromocytoma
Adrenal metastasis and lymphoma
Myelolipoma
Adrenal cyst
A 40 year old male with a suspected "infiltrate" seen on chest radiographs.  A chest CT was performed after follow-up chest radiographs failed to show resolution.
According to an NIH consensus statement, a mass that is stable on imaging examinations seperated by at least six months and that demonstrates no evidence of hyperfunction over 4 years needs no further follow-up.
