Hemorrhage
23 year old female treated with bromocriptine for a known pituitary prolactinoma is now in the third trimester of pregnancy and no longer taking bromocriptine.  She has a 3-5 day history of blurry vision, worse today.
Hemorrhage can occur into a pre-existing adenoma or into a hormonally enlarged gland.  Infarction and necrosis is generally part of the pathophysiology.  Classic Sheehan's syndrome occurs post-partum.  Pituitary apoplexy is a more generalized term.
