No focal neurological deficits. No abnormal PE findings.
Definitive identification of the arterial supply and venous drainage of this vascular malformation requires conventional cerebral angiography.  This particular case was then treated utilizing endovascular coil embolization.  The initial coiling procedure was done July 2003 with subsequent follow up imaging and probable re-coiling to be done in the future.

Other treatment options for AVM include surgery and stereotactic radiotherapy.
Multiple serpentine flow voids are noted in the right temporal lobe with involvement of portions of the right occipital lobe.  After intravenous Gadolinium administration, there is avid serpiginous enhancement of this lesion.  There is interposed neural tissue seen within the enhancing vessels. The feeding arteries appear to involve the right middle cerebral artery circulation as well as from right posterior cerebral artery contributions.  Much better delineation of the vascular supply and drainage is possible with MRA.  Although despite recent advances in MRA techniques, conventional digital subtraction angiography is still required for definitive vascular mapping prior to treatment.
Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation
Four types of vascular malformation
1. Arteriovenous malformation
2. Capillary telangiectasia
3. Cavernous hemangioma
4. Venous angioma
