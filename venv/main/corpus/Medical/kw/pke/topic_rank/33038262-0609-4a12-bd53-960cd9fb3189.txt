Neurologic: Cranial nerve I is intact to coffee.  Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact. Deep tendon reflexes are normal at the elbows, knees and ankles. She has excellent muscle strength, bulk and tone in all groups tested.
At her follow up, the neurosurgeon decided this is a non-surgical lesion based on the imaging findings.  Although the patient has had a history of fleeting headaches, it was decided this lesion is likely not the cause. Patient is to follow up from now on with neurology and have an EEG performed as an outpatient.
There is a vascular malformation extending from the right lateral ventricle.  This would be consistent with a venous angioma, however there is evidence of prior hemorrhage and encephalomalacia in this region.
Developmental Venous Anomaly
• Dural sinus thrombosis
• Sturge Weber syndrome with leptomeningeal angiomatosis
• Demyelination
• Developmental Venous Anomaly
10-year-old girl with PMH significant for hypothyroidism, high cholesterol, and obesity was watching TV when she had acute onset of numbness and tingling in her left arm and leg.  The left UE and LE then began to twitch at 1 Hz, and this continued for 10 minutes.  The patient was conscious and conversant throughout the entire incident.  Her arm was then immobile for 10 minutes following the twitching, after which all symptoms disappeared.  She has never had a history of seizures or focal symptoms before.
