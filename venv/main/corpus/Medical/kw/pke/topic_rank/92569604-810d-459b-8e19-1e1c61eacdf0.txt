Increased weakness of lower extremeties.
unknown
MR imaging may show foci of high-velocity signal loss within the enlarged vessels.  The cord is sometimes atrophic, and high signal intensity is often observed on T2-weighted scans.  Hemorrhagic products may be present.
Dural arteriovenous fistula, lumbar spine
Dural AV fistula
Dephasing from turbulent CSF flow or CSF flowing at different rates within functionally separate compartments created by the dentate ligaments and septum posticum around the thoracic spinal cord.
61 year old male with progressive weakness of lower extremities.
This case nicely demonstrates the flow voids seen in dural arteriovenous fistulas.  These lesions are important to recognize and treat early in order to prevent unnecessary neurologic loss.
