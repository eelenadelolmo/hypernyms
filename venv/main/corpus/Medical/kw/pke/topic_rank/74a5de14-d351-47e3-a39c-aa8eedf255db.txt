Unremarkable
MR study vs. Sulfur colloid study
Unenhanced liver CT demonstrates a round lesion in left lobe of liver that is isodense to liver with a central area f decreased attenuation. Late arterial phase image demonstrates enhancement of the 4 cm round lesion with a persistent central 1 cm area that did not enhance. Portal venous phase image demonstrates isoattenuation to liver and persistent hypoattenuation of the central area.
This is a differential case. Final diagnosis is pending
Focal nodular hyperplasia (most likely based on age, gender and appearance)
Hepatic adenoma
Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma
Hemangioma (less likely)
31 y.o. Female, asymptomatic had incidental finding of a "hepatic" lesion in a CT study performed in Korea. Patient does not have previous study and a repeat CT was requested at a DoD medical facility. Patient is otherwise in good health.
This patient was lost to follow-up and will remain a differential case.
