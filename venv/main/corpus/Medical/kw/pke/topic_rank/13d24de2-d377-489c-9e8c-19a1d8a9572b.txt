• Atrophic right chest appearance.
• Palpable right ribs, absence of pectoralis major on right.
• No associated upper extremity abnormalities.
When a patient with Poland's syndrome is first encountered clinical presentation and patient history must be taken into account when evaluating for possible diagnosis. When looking at a chest xray a lucent area must be ruled out for possible pneumothorax. In patients with Poland syndrome skeletal deformities may involve absence of portions of the ribs or costal cartilages anteriorly. In severe cases, anterior lung herniation may be present and this can lead to pneumothorax.
• Suggestion of an increased lucency over the right mid to lower lung region consistent with the patient's given history of absence of the pectoralis major muscle. 
• Lungs are clear and evenly aerated without evidence of focal consolidations or masses. 
• The ribs are normal in appearance and number. The clavicles are normal in appearance.  
• No pleural effusions are seen.  
• There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  
• The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal and the remainder of the bones and the soft tissues are unremarkable.
• No other abnormalities are identified.
Poland Syndrome
• Pneumothroax
• Abscence of right pectoralis major (surgical or congenital)
• Adenomatoid malformation
• Bronchogenic cyst 
• Hygroma
• Foreign body aspiration with air trapping
18-year-old gentleman with asymmetry of the chest from a known congenital absence of the right pectoralis major muscle
Evaluation for associated features of Poland Syndrome:
Abnormalities of rib cage
Upper extremity anomalies; short upper arm, forearm, or fingers (brachysymphalangism)
Hypoplasia or aplasia of serratus, external oblique, pectoralis minor, latissimus dorsi,1 infraspinatus, and supraspinatus muscles 
Total absence of anterolateral ribs and herniation of lung 
Symphalangism with syndactyly and hypoplasia or aplasia of the middle phalanges

Examination of lymph nodes and a complete blood cell count should assist with evaluation for associated leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Functional disability in Poland syndrome is mild. Patients with Poland syndrome present for treatment of the chest deformity and breast asymmetry. Reconstruction requires determination of chest wall abnormalities and the presence of the latissimus muscle. Three main determinants influence the timing and options for reconstruction: breast development, existence of a latissimus dorsi muscle, and degree of chest wall deformity.
