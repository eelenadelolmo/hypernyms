Physical examination revealed pallor,   and a  huge, firm ,  mobile epigastric lump. No organomegally, no lymphadenopathy and no lower limb edema.

Blood analysis showed  iron deficiency anemia , hyponatremia ,hypokalaemia , hypochloraemia , metabolic alkalosis  and hypoalbuminaemia.
Short-term preoperative intravenous hyper alimentation  followed  by blood transfusion were done.   At Laparotomy   a  gastric polyp with overlying mucosal ulceration associated with  Perigastric lymphadenopathy were found (fig 6). No organ deposits depicted.  Pylorus preserving partial gastrectomy with pyloroplasty and  lymphadenectomy were performed.  The patient had an Uneventful post operative course with  3-5 kg weight gain at 10 weeks post operative. Gastroscopy with multiple biopsies  done at 12 weeks post operative were normal.
Abdominal ultrasound  showed  huge well defined  hypoechoic lobulated  mass  surrounded on its upper surface by air , occupying almost the whole gastric lumen , arising from the posterior wall of the gastric body and  protruding slightly into the pyloric region (Fig 1) . The remainder of abdominal ultrasound was normal.

Computed tomography  of the abdomen  after oral contrast opacification and before  and after  intravenous contrast medium injection demonstrated an intra gastric  lobulated heterogeneous mass  predominantly hypodense (densities about  20 UH) associated  with a more dense area  (50 UH density)  located at its base of insertion (Figs 2,3).

After intravenous   contrast medium injection the mass showed peripheral   contrast uptake   with   enhancement of the more  dense component area. The low   attenuating areas seen in the native cuts within the mass  showed  mild contrast uptake.  Superficial   ulceration  was also demonstrated at its superior surface. The base of insertion of the mass was   located at the posterior aspect the gastric body   without   extragastric   extension(Figs 4,5).

29 yr old Saudi woman teacher, presented with 6 months history of epigastric  pain, vomiting, and progressive weight loss. Vomiting  was projectile , non bilious, and tends to occur postprandially. Bowel habits were normal. No other symptoms referable to other systems.
IFP is a solitary pedunculated   or sessile lesion with an inflammatory basis. It is a rare benign lesion that may occur throughout the digestive tract, but is most often seen in the stomach (approximately 80%) (4). IFP in the stomach is usually located in the antrum or prepyloric region (5,6) .
In large retrospective studies of  gastric polyps, 3.1-4.5% were found to be IFP[6,7]. It is slightly more common in women (female:male ratio 1.6:1) (6).It is found in all age groups, although not often in children, and its maximal incidence is in the sixth decade (7).  Most  such polyps are small (<3.0 cm), but some as large as 19 cm in size have been reported . ileal lesions tend to be larger than those in the stomach (4).
Clinical manifestations of IFP are variable, depending on the location and size of the lesion. Most are small and asymptomatic. Nevertheless, it is able to cause anemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal pain, vomiting, weight loss, intestinal obstruction or intussusception. In the stomach, it causes pyloric obstruction particularly with big size where the mass  may  occasionally  prolapse  through  the pylorus, causing gastric outlet obstruction  as seen in our case .in the small bowel, intussusception is the most common presentation particularly  in children. 
Physical examination is usually not conclusive . 
Our case is unusual in several aspects, such as the patient's young age at the presentation (29 years  of age ), the intermittent  gastric outlet obstruction  ,the location of the mass at the corpus of the stomach and the relative big size  of the mass ( 9cm)  .
Laboratory  studies are  usually non specific and  demonstrate often   a severe anemia .
Imagings such as upper GI series, ultrasonography or computed tomography can help diagnose the mass. the lesion may appear  on barium studies as  sessile  or less frequently , pedonculated  polyps with smooth or slightly  lobulated contours . As a result  they may be indistinguishable  from adenomatous polyps in the stomach.  Other inflammatory fibroid polyps  that have a submucosal appearance can  be mistaken  for leiomyomas . Rarely , inflammatory fibroid polyps  are larger  or more lobulated , mimicking  the appearance of  polypoid gastric  carcinomas. Unfortunately  barium study was not performed in our patient  , only abdominal ultrasound and CT scan were done .
Ultrasound   can help in the determination of the  location   and the  cystic or solid nature of the lesion  particularly  when the mass has a big size , as  demonstrated  with our patient. But when the  tumor size is small  , ultrasound  can not be able  to detect it , in contrast with  barium series particularly double contrast studies  which can depict smaller  lesions .
CT sacn is more helpful as seen   in our   patient by  demonstrating the location in the stomac , the size ,    and the solid nature of the mass .
Contrast medium injection can demonstrate   an increased uptake in the periphery of the lesion and in scattered areas of the mass
 but the final diagnosis is generally based on endoscopy and histological examination. There were no distinctive radiological features to differentiate IFPs from other mural or intraluminal lesions of the gastrointestinal tract.
