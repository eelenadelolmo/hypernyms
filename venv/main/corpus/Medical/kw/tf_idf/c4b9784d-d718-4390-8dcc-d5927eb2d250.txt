a 56 year-old retired african american male was involved in a motor vehicle accident.  he was t-boned on the driver side as his car entered a road cross-section causing the car to flip over several times and land onto the sidewalk.  he eventually ended up striking the entire left side of his body against the driver door/window.  he was wearing a seatbelt during the accident and reports that he has never been in a car accident before.  he denied hitting his head and losing consciousness.  after the accident, his son took him to ecmc for further evaluation where he received imaging and was subsequently discharged.
after the accident, the patient complained of neck pain and stiffness, radiating pain into upper extremities, painful cervical spine with lateral bending, extension, and flexion, arm and hand numbness, tingling, and pain, and headaches.  the pain level is rated 5/10.  he reported that the pain limited his ability to perform simple household chores involving lifting.  he has no issue with walking.  the pain of his left arm interferes with his ability to sleep.  the pain often wakes him from his sleep 2-3 times.  he has tried naproxen but the naproxen was ineffective in pain relief.  left shoulder corticosteroid injection helped with his pain.  wrist corticosteroid injection did not help with his pain. tramadol/carisoprodol seems to help with his pain at night. he denies anxiety and depression.  he is married and lives with his wife.  
social history: the patient is retired and lives in a house with his wife.  he reports that he rarely drinks alcohol for social occasions.  he uses marijuana for chronic pain.  he currently smokes and has smoked ½ ppd 40 years.
past medical history:
gerd, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, bullet wound left hand, gastric bypass in 2015 (he reports that he weighed 400 lbs. before the procedure), bilateral knee replacement, wrist arthritic bone removal 5-6 years ago from left radial wrist.  he reports no complications with prior wrist surgery.  left torn biceps muscle a year ago.  stab wound 30 years ago in left frontal region of chest.  denies diabetes and thyroid disease.  
medications: omeprazole, amlodipine, atorvastatin, tramadol

cervical spine- mri has shown signs of cervical disc herniation, foraminal stenosis and osteophyte formation in regions of cervical spine mentioned above. the discs tend to bulge posterolaterally because the front and back of the vertebral bodies that sandwich them are reinforced by the very strong central ligaments.  posteriorly the uncinate processes help to prevent disc herniations.  posterolateral disc bulging and left central osteophytes can impinge the nerve root.  osteophytes can  cause foraminal stenosis due to osteophytes crowding out the opening causing nerve root impingement.  nerve root impingement can cause radiculopathy—a sensation of pain, numbness, tingling, and/or weakness in the associated dermatome[1].  disc herniation was most prominent between c4/c5, c5/c6, and c6/c7.  this prompted further evaluation for possible radiculopathy via electrophysiological testing.  electrophysiological testing demonstrated radiculopathy of the c5 nerve root.  this could explain the patient’s pain in the neck, shoulder and lateral arm [2]. the primarily unilateral nature of the patient’s pain suggests that radiculopathy is causing the pain more than spondylosis (pain typically bilateral) [2].  the disc herniation can be caused by via normal aging.  the low signal of intervertebral discs seen in the patients t2 weighted sagittal imaging support the natural drying associated with aging of the intervertebral discs.  disc fibrous composition becomes irregular making outer annulus fibrosus more susceptible to tears.  the inner nucleus pulposus leaks out to impinge on nerve root and/or spinal cord.  whiplash from the motor vehicle accident could also cause cervical disc herniation.  the sudden movement of the neck puts increased pressure on the intervertebral discs causing the annulus fibrosus to break and nucleus fibrosus to leak out.  a combination of these two factors could also contribute to the disc herniation.  an age-weakened disc can be more sensitive to the pressures associated with sudden neck movement in whiplash.

shoulder- - mri of the left shoulder showed increased signal intensity on a t2- weighted image around the supraspinatus tendon.  the tendon was also thickened.  this supraspinatus tendinopathy most likely occurred due to impingement via the acromion and contributes to the patient's left shoulder pain.  the increased signal intensity is a sign of inflammation.  the positive supraspinatus physical exam test also supports this finding.  impingement of the acromion on the supraspinatus tendon is the most common cause of supraspinatus tendinopathy[3].  this impingement could be due to anatomical variations of the acromion or changes in angle and shape of the acromion that would predispose a patient to impingement[3].  other causes of supraspinatus tendinopathy include normal aging, overuse, trauma, and low blood supply.  the supraspinatus tendon has been found by some to have regions of hypovascularity.  abduction of the arm can cause the supraspinatus to compress against the head of the humerus leading to significant loss of vascular supply.  arthritic changes have also been proposed to cause supraspinatus tendinopathy and, in this patient, have been found in the rotator cuff region.  mri images show presence of subchondral cysts and ac arthrosis.  it is thought that bone spurs can cause tendon tears but this view is not universally accepted.  [3] 
most likely impingement via acromion during impact in motor vehicle accident is the cause of this patient's supraspinatus tendinopathy.  the resultant tendon tears lead to a healing process that replaces tissue formerly composed of mainly type 1 collagen, with mainly type 3 collagen.  the type 3 collagen is weaker than type 1 so the body compensates by replacing injured region with excessive amounts of  type  3 collagen.  this leads to overall thickening of the tendon which does not function as well as the original thinner tendon.  this could contribute to the limited range of arm abduction.  this patient's smoking status could interfere with this healing process.  nicotine is known to be vasoconstrictor, which would lower access of healing tissue to oxygen.  nicotine also lowers the concentration of collagen which could also delay the healing process.[3]  however, it should be noted that the area of the tendon beneath the acromion is know to be a an area of avascularity. 

ac arthrosis was also noted on mri of left shoulder. this is osteoarthritis of acromioclavicular joint that connects the scapula to the clavicle.  the articulation area between the scapula and clavicle is very small yet the load of the arm is very large.  this leads to high stress that wears out the cartilage that lines the joint.  this could also independently contribute to the shoulder pain and possible be a cause of the supraspinatus tendinopathy. [4]


wrist-- carpal tunnel syndrome-mri axial images of the wrist show flattening of the median nerve as it passes through flexor retinaculum.  this prompted further evaluation via electrophysiology which revealed bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome of the wrists.  this could contribute to the pain, tingling and weakness of the patient's left hand aggravated by impact of left hand on steering wheel during the mva.  
the carpal tunnel median nerve compression and cervical root compression at c5 could support possibility of double crush phenomenon.  the c5 root forms part of the proximal part of median nerve since it contributes fibers to the more distal median nerve.  double crush is thought to occur when the portion of median nerve most proximal to the spine is damaged (in this patient that is the c5 nerve root).  this damage makes the distal part of the nerve more sensitive to injury.  it was thought that distal nerve was sensitive because the damage of the proximal nerve interfered with axonal trafficking.  neurons use axons to send nutrients from cell body (proximal and close to spine) down long axon and to remove waste products from axons to cell body.  but this explanation only works for motor neurons which are multipolar (several dendrites and one axon).  the sensory neurons are unipolar.  they consist of a cell body with two axons-- one axon passes through the distal arm and the other passes through the spinal cord. each axon has its own microtubule machinery for axonal trafficking which does not support the axonal trafficking theory for double crush pathology. it is now proposed that for sensory neurons the proximal nerve damage interferes with action potential propagation.  the impaired proximal action potential propagation makes the distal nerve more sensitive to injury.  when distal nerve injury does occur, it leads to pain of the entire arm worse than either nerve pole injury alone.[5]
several ligaments in the left wrist were damaged.  the scapholunate ligament damage led to scapholunate interval widening seen on mri.  the two wrist bones are not held together as tightly because of ligament tear allowing inflammatory fluid to seep between them widening the distance between them.  this widened interval caused the wrist bones to shift over the ulna resulting in negative ulnar variance.  imaging revealed possible tear of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.  the complex of ligaments has major role in wrist bone stability, providing a smooth articulation surface across distal radius and ulna, and cushioning impact through the wrist.  signs of ligament tear include globular and linear signals on the ulnar side of the wrist.  weakened ligament is not able to hold the wrist bones together very tightly allowing inflammatory effusion to seep between the bones producing the enhanced signal.  both scapholunate and tfcc ligaments were likely damaged during impact of the patient’s left wrist against the steering wheel during mva.  [6]

the resulting wrist instability and pain along with carpal tunnel syndrome aggravation prompted the patient to undergo wrist surgery-- left wrist arthrodesis and carpal tunnel release.  post-surgery/recovery the pain in the left wrist/shoulder/arm/hand increased.  additionally, the patient felt a sense of temperature change in the left upper extremity as oppoted to the right with a hypersensitivity to light touch over the left upper extremity.  these features are associated with complex regional pain syndrome.  after trauma, the limb undergoes a normal inflammatory process with warmth, redness, and increased sensitivity to pain. this inflammatory phase represents the acute phase of crps but since it is indistinguishable from normal inflammatory process, crps cannot be diagnosed at this stage.  an unknown mechanism changes this inflammatory driven pain to sympathetic nervous system driven pain.  this is the  chronic phase of crps.  in experimental studies it has been shown that number of adrenergic receptors on nociceptive neurons and blood vessels is increased.  this leads to hypersensitivity to low levels of adrenergic neurotransmitters.  when neurotransmitters bind the alpha adrenergic receptors on blood vessels this leads to vasoconstriction and resultant blue and cold limbs.  binding of neurotransmitters to nociceptive neurons increases pain signals sent to central nervous system.  [7,8,9]

complex regional pain syndrome formerly known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome is also associated with the following synonyms: causalgia, minor causalgia, sudeck's atrophy, sudeck-leriche syndrome, shoulder-hand syndrome, algodystrophy, post-traumatic dystrophy and post-traumatic arthrosis.  other synonyms include transient osteoporosis of the bone, post-traumatic pain syndrome, spreading neuralgia, sympathalgia, neurodystrophic syndrome, acute atrophy of the bone, peripheral acute trophoneurosis, traumatic angiospasm, post-traumatic osteoporosis, traumatic vasospasm, reflex dystrophy of the extremities, post-infarctional sclerodactyly and reflex neurovascular dystrophy [10].  if this patient has the inflammatory phase of crps it will be hard to diagnose the disease since the course behaves like normal inflammatory process associated with injury.  some researchers found a 3 degree celsius difference in temperature between the affected limb and the normal limb in patients with crps [11].  the stellate ganglion block/bier blocks in stage 2 may be used in this stage for the shoulder-hand syndrome variant in the differential diagnosis of the condition.  by inhibiting the stellate ganglion, the painful effects of vasoconstriction are eliminated.  the manner to determine if the stellate ganglion block was effective is to note the following:  a horner's syndrome and warming of the effective hand to 32-34oc (90-93of) and relief of pain.  sympathetic blocks may be helpful therapeutically, as well as diagnostically, to help break the pain cycle.  a three- phase bone scan of the shoulder-hand variant usually denotes increased uptake in the wrist, metacarpophalangeal (mp) and interphalangeal joints in crps. such is more sensitive than plain film radiography, although as the condition continues to manifest an osteopenia in the same regions may be noted.  others were able to diagnose the disease during the chronic phase via administering alpha blocks to see if pain was relieved [7].  however, it is still recommended by most to diagnose the disease clinically and only via exclusion since disease findings are similar to other diseases such as neuropathy [7,8,9].
