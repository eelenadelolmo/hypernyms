physical examination revealed tenderness in the left lower quadrant without palpable mass. laboratory findings were normal.
the patient underwent a surgical removal of the lesion. histological examination revealed areas of typical endometrial glands surrounded by stroma and bordered by vessels with occasional foci of haemosiderin-laden macrophages typical of endometriosis (figures 10, 11). follow up of patient by ultrasound 2 years after surgery did not reveal any recurrence of tumor.
imaging evaluation started with pelvic ultrasound demonstrating left pelvic parietal suprapubic poorly defined solid mass measuring 3 cm x 2cm, located within the left rectus muscle just under the previous caesarian scar with inhomogeneous predominantly hypoechoic echo texture in association with internal scattered hyperechoic echoes (figure 1). a hyperechoic ring of variable width and continuity surrounded this mass. 
color doppler examination revealed a single vascular pedicle entering the mass at the periphery (figures 2-4). 
the patient then underwent a pelvic ct scan demonstrating an isodense nodular thickening of the most distal part of the left rectus abdominis muscle protruding posteriorly into the pelvis without contact with the urinary bladder anterior wall (figure 5).
subsequently, a pelvic mri (1.5 t; ge) was performed to further establish the nature of lesion. the mass was confirmed to be intramuscular in location and was inhomogeneously hyperintense on a stir sequence (figure 6), nearly isointense to surrounding muscle on t1 weighted images with  fat saturation (figure 7) and inhomogeneously enhancing after gadolinium contrast medium administration (figures 8, 9). the mass was situated below the pfannenstiel-scar of the caesarean section.
endometriosis of left rectus abdominis muscle
these imaging findings and particularly the location at site of previous cesarian section raised the possibility of endometriosis.
the differential diagnosis of a solid mass in the rectus abdominis muscle includes endometriosis, abscesses, haematomas, hernia, benign tumours (e.g. haemangioma, desmoid tumour) and malignancies such as lymphomas and sarcomas.
a 46-year-old woman presented with left lower quadrant pain, ongoing for 6 months, but worsening the last 2 months. this pain was associated with her menstrual cycles. there was a prior medical history of a caesarean section.
discussion

endometriosis, a disorder afflicting as many as 5–10% of women of childbearing age, is defined as the presence of functional endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity (1,3). 

the most common extrapelvic location of endometriosis is the abdominal wall, particularly in surgical scars related to gynecologic or obstetric surgery (3, 4). the etiology of these foci of endometriosis is thought to be an iatrogenic transfer of endometrial cells into the surgical or procedural wound (16). abdominal wall endometriosis has been reported after amniocentesis, hypertonic saline solution abortion, and laparoscopy (4, 5). however, none of these interventions had been performed in our patient, there was only a prior history of caesarian section. rectus abdominis endometrioma, where the endometrial focus is solely confined to within the body of the rectus abdominis muscle is rare and sparsely reported in literature (4,11). 

in abdominal wall endometriosis, the most common presenting symptom is a painful abdominal mass, which may fluctuate in size and severity of pain in relation to the menstrual cycle (6) as seen with our patient but without palpable mass. 

ultrasonography is used routinely in the assessment of patients with abdominal pain (4). however, endometrial lesions located in the abdominal wall are easily missed during sonographic examination when the appropriate probe is not used, particularly in obese patients. in our case we started with a 3.5 mhz transducer for exploration of deep pelvic organs which were normal. however, during the passage of the probe on the left pelvic abdominal wall the patient showed focal tenderness at this area. for this raison, we shifted to a high-resolution 7.5 mhz transducer that demonstrated the superficial rectus abdominis muscle nodule. the lesions of abdominal wall endometriosis have been described as solid, irregular or elongated, or poorly defined hypoechoic masses that can involve the rectus abdominis muscle and, eventually, the subcutaneous fat (1,3,4,17,18,19). infrequently a small fluid collection is found in the center of the mass. in our case the mass was heterogenous, predominantly hypoechoic with internal scattered hyperechoic echoes, and was surrounded by a hyperechoic ring of variable width and continuity. at color doppler examination, the vascularisation of the lesion depends on the lesion size. abundant intralesional vascularization is commonly seen if the lesion has a diameter of greater than 3 cm, whereas no vascular sign could be detected if the lesion is smaller than 15 mm. for a size between 2 and 3cm as noted with our patient a single vascular pedicle, entering the mass at the periphery was shown (1,4,17,18,19). 

ct scan is nonspecific and demonstrates focal tissue stranding and thickening of the rectus abdominal muscle as seen with our patient(1,11).

classical mri findings, consisting of multiple cystic structures which appear hyperintense on t1 weighted images and having different signal intensity patterns on t2 weighted images (20) were not present in our patient. the mass was isointense to muscle in t1 images and hyperintense in stir sequence with contrast enhancement after injection. mri, albeit non-specific, may be useful in distinguishing endometrial tissue from surrounding structures. mr is highly sensitive in detecting very small masses and offers excellent differentiation of endometriomas from neighbouring tissue (10). the multitude of signal patterns seen in endometriomas is due, in part, to the different stages of blood products found within these implants. in our case ct and mr imaging did not reveal the presence of hemorrhage in the mass. 

due to this non-specific presentation, a broad radiological differential diagnosis remains. the differential diagnosis of a solid mass in the rectus abdominis muscle includes endometriosis, abscesses, haematomas, hernia, benign tumours (e.g. haemangioma, desmoid tumour) and malignancies such as lymphomas and sarcomas (1,2,11). 

a certain diagnosis can only be accomplished by histological examination of the lesion (fine-needle aspirate or core biopsy obtained under ultrasound or ct-guidance) (21) or after surgical removal of the lesion, as was the case in our patient. 
gross pathological findings of endometriosis depend on the duration of the disease and depth of penetration of the lesions. implants may change in appearance during the menstrual cycle, becoming more swollen and congested during menses and bleeding in some cases. at microscopic analysis, endometriosis is composed of endometrial glands, stroma, and occasionally smooth muscle fibres. as with eutopic endometrium, the ectopic endometrial foci respond to circulating hormones and may show secretory changes during the second half of the menstrual cycle. haemorrhage within these foci results in an inflammatory response, with infiltration of histiocytes that become pigment laden with haemosiderin (1). 

the treatment for endometriotic foci in the rectus abdominis muscle is usually surgically (4), by excision of the mass, or can be expectant depending on the severity of symptoms. 
in conclusion, although rare, the diagnosis of endometriosis of the abdominal wall is difficult and requires a high index of suspicion in the absence of a history of previous surgery. therefore, imaging findings of a solid abdominal wall mass near a cesarean section scar associated with exacerbation of symptoms with menses should strongly suggest the diagnosis of endometrioma.  the final diagnosis of endometriosis usually is made only after histologic examination of the mass.
