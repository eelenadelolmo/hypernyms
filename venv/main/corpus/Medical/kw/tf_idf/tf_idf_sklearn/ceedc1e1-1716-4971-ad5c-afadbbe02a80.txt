22 year old female who presented with a one year history of infertility.  her past medical history is significant for regular painful menses since approximately 15 years old.  she had had an ectopic pregnancy in the refion of her left ovary which was removed approximately one year prior to presentation.
des is a synthetic estrogen used in the 1940's and 1950's.  this patient was born in 1982 and therefore was unlikely to have been exposed to this specific agent.  however, the radiographic appearance of the uterus as well as the clinical picture of ectopic pregnancy and infertility mirror those found in des exposed fetus.  this patient's mother took several medications while pregnant and this may have contributed to the abnormalities noted on exam.
