pt is follows simple commands, continues to be non-verbal, perrla, neurological exam is grossly intact. the pt has numerous scars on her extremities, sebaceous adenomas on her face, as well as a shagreen patch on her forehead.  there are areas of cutaneous hyperpigmentation on her back.
the main complication of tuberous sclerosis requiring long term therapy is seizure disorders, as was this case with our patient.  she was placed on antiepileptic medication and has spent much of her childhood in institutions due to her behavioral and developmental delays as well as poor family support.  in oct 2006 she had a peg tube placed for poor feeding and is being closely monitored by her pcp and a neurologist.  standards currently suggest follow-up mris every 1-3 years in children with tuberous sclerosis. options for treatment outside of antiepileptic medications include immunosuppressive therapy, surgical resection such as focal cortical resection, corpus callosotomy , or vagal stimulation.  since subependymal giant cell astrocytomas are associated with tuberous sclerosis and can cause hydrocephalus, surgical resection may be indicated.
mri of the brain w/o iv contrast.  the  ventricles  are increased  slightly  in  size  which most likely represent  mild  atrophy.    approximately six subependymal lesions  are  identified  in the lateral ventricles bilaterally with enhancement  of  the  largest  lesion  in  the right  lateral  ventricle  which  measures  approximately  1.1  cm  in  its greatest  diameter.   these appear unchanged from previous studies.   noted  are  the  multiple  areas  of  abnormal  t2  prolongation  scattered  throughout  the cerebral  hemispheres.    these  are  grossly  unchanged  when compared  with previous  studies.   there is no increase  in  the extra-axial  fluid.    there  is  no  evidence  of  cerebellar  ectopia.    the anterior  pituitary  is noted  to  be  concaved  but  is  grossly  unchanged  when  compared  with  previous  studies.    the  corpus  callosum  is  somewhat  thin.

16 y/o white female who presented to the er with her mother with c/o increasing seizure activity, increased self-mutilation, and violence towards others.  pt has longstanding hx of problems since birth to include autism, mental retardation,  developmental delay, as well as seizure disorder. the pt is non-verbal. the patient was being followed at another facility, however, due to a recent move, her family now wishes to have her care in your facility.
as is the case with more than 90 percent of tuberous sclerosis patients with brain involvement, this patient presented to the er with convulsions.  though her underlying hx of seizures disorder complicates the picture, it is likely that some of the problems she is having are manifestation of her tuberous sclerosis.  in addition, this patient, like 50-85 percent of those affected by tuberous sclerosis has severe developmental delay.  she also had the skin manifestation that are characteristic in more than 80 percent of patient's to include shagreen patches and sebaceous adenomas on her face.  this patient's condition was being managed conservatively with antiepileptic medication and routine follow-up mris. interestingly, within the past year the patient also had renal us done due to possible renal cysts versus tumors, which can be found in up to 80 percent of patients with tuberous sclerosis.  however, at the time of this posting, the final results are not known.
