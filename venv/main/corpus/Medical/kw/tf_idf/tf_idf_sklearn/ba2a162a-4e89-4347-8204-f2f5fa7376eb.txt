pulmonary: lungs cta bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi

upper thigh numbness with flexion at left hip, left leg with decreased muscular mass compared to the right leg
the patient is following up with a chiropractor, a neurologist, and a psychiatrist. the chiropractor is helping him

with his cervical and lumbar back pain. the neurologist has prescribed him amitriptyline for his headaches and

deplin for his mthfr mutation. deplin is l-methylfolate, which is the product of a functioning mthfr gene and

is meant as a supplement to his lower functioning mthfr protein. the psychiatrist has prescribed cymbalta, but the

patient is unsure why he is taking it. the cymbalta may be for sleep or any component of radicular pain he may

have. the patient has had several lab tests that were all negative, including tests for homocystinuria, which is

associated with his mthfr gene mutations. he has had a ct scan and an mri of his head. the ct showed a small

hyperdensity in his left cerebellum, which could represent a small hemorrhagic contusion from the mva. the mri

showed two small hyperintensities in his left parietal and right frontal lobes. these may represent small vessel

disease and could therefore support a diagnosis of vascular dementia, possibly partially due to his mthfr gene

mutations. the hyperdensity on ct is not visualized on mri, which may indicate that the small hemorrhagic

contusion has resolved.

the patient’s cognitive difficulties, including word finding difficulties and comprehension difficulties, could be post-

concussive symptoms from a mild traumatic brain injury. this diagnosis would also fit with his headache, dizziness,

nausea, and trouble sleeping. some of his cognitive difficulties may be due to his mthfr gene mutation, which has

been linked to vascular dementia and depression. although he denies depression, he is having sleep difficulties and

he is taking cymbalta. his mri showed some hyperintensities that are consistent with vascular dementia, as

discussed below in the follow up section. the fatigability of his eye muscles may be due to his mild tbi, as some

patients experience ocular symptoms such as diplopia. this symptom is also a common early finding in myasthenia

gravis. early myasthenia gravis often affects the eye muscles and manifests commonly as fatigability with prolonged

upward gaze.
the patient is a 56 year old male with a recent history of motor vehicle collision on september 28, 2015. he reports

that he was stopped at a stop sign and was rear-ended. he was wearing a seatbelt at the time. his forehead struck the

steering wheel and he sustained a forehead laceration. he had no loss of consciousness, but he reports that he was

walking around after the accident in an effort to prevent himself from “passing out.” since the accident, he reportsword finding difficulty and problems with comprehension that have improved in the last few weeks. he also feels

dizzy, nauseous, and reports retching in the morning two times in the last week. he denies vomiting. his dizziness is

worse when walking up and down stairs, and he reports walking slowly due to dizziness when he was leaving the

hospital after being evaluated for the motor vehicle collision. he also reports having bruises on his forehead and

around his eyes after the accident. he has had a constant headache since the accident, which he rated 9/10 at the time

of the accident, but it has now improved to a 6/10. he reports that the headache sometimes wake him up from a

sound sleep. the headache is worse when he bends over, and is improved by taking ibuprofen before he goes to sleep

every night. he reports trouble sleeping and not feeling rested when he wakes up in the morning. he has had

photophobia, phonophobia, and neck stiffness/pain with flexion. he denies numbness or tingling in his arms. he

denies feeling depressed, but he is taking cymbalta and amitriptyline. he reports that his left eye wanders when he

gets tired, and that he is unable to look up with his left eye for an extended period of time. he denies chest pain,

shortness of breath, and abdominal pain.

past medical history:

he has a history of lower back pain and radicular pain down his left leg due to spondylosis in his lumbar spine. he

was recently diagnosed with two different mthfr polymorphisms (c677t and a1298c). he reports that he was

diagnosed with these gene mutations by the psychiatrist he was sent to by his neurologist, but he denies any

psychiatric symptoms including anxiety or depression. he had a tubular adenoma removed on colonoscopy one year

ago. he reports having been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea via a sleep study. he denies any history of

hypertension or diabetes.
case contributors: vincent reed lasala, geoffrey gerow

mthfr is a recently recognized risk factor for numerous common diseases, such as hypertension, heart failure,

vascular dementia, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, venous thrombosis, endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, depression, bipolar disorder, and miscarriages. it is also associated with spina bifida, anencephaly, and

homocystinuria. since the patient has two mutated alleles, he is at increased risk of developing these conditions.

some of his symptoms may be related to early vascular dementia accelerated by his mthfr mutations, as there are

some lesions on his mri that are consistent with this condition. he also seemed to have some mild cognitive slowing

during the clinical encounter, which may be related to possible early vascular dementia from his mthfr. his

cognitive symptoms may also be related to the mild tbi he sustained in his recent motor vehicle accident. symptoms

such as headaches, dizziness, nausea, and comprehension difficulties are common in mild tbi patients, and the fact

that some of his cognitive symptoms such as his word finding difficulties have resolved supports a diagnosis of mild

tbi with post-concussive syndrome. another mri to determine whether the hyperintense lesions on his previous

mri have resolved or developed into hemosiderin deposits may help distinguish mtbi from early vascular dementia

in this case. if the lesions have resolved or developed into hemosiderin deposits, that would support mtbi with

resolving brain contusion and if they remain, it would support vascular white matter changes that may represent early

vascular dementia accelerated by his mthfr mutation. his new symptoms of eye muscle fatigability may also be a

result of his mild tbi. since fatigability with upward gaze is a common finding in early myasthenia gravis, an anti-

acetylcholine receptor test may be warranted to rule out this disease.
