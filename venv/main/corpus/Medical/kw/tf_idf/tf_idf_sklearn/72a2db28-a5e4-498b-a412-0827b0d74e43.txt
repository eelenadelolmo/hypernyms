physical exam and laboratory:  t 38 c, hr 77,  bp 104/70, rr 15  gen: pt resting comfortably, but appears mildly sob.  resp: ctab, shallow breathing.  cv: rrr, normal s1 and s2

treatment and follow-up: 
pt underwent an emergent surgery for removal of the migrated ivc filter.  under anesthesia, a median sternotomy was performed, the filter was approached through the right atrium.  the filter was found lodged in the tricuspid valve and a cordea tendine was damaged during extraction requiring a primary repair.  pt received 500cc of blood during surgey.  she required prolonged ventilator support post-op.  a left chest tube was also placed as treatment for the l pleural effusion with 500cc of fluid drained in 24 hours.  pt was extubated 3 days following surgery. her chest tube was removed on the same day.  she was transferred to the ward the following day.  post-op ekg showed no signs of mi or further arrhythmia.  pt did well on the ward.  after her post-op recovery she received another, larger, greenfield ivc filter.  placement was successful and was without filter migration.
image findings: 
1. migration of greenfield filter to tricuspid valve
2. large left pleural effusion.
ivc filter migration
differential diagnosis for these findings in this case:
ivc filter migration
history (can include gestational age, or age in days, weeks, months):     55 yo white female presented with shortness of breath 4 days after she underwent arthroscopic knee surgery.  she was diagnosed with a pe at that time.  as her pe developed in the setting of adequate anticoagulation (inr of 3.9) she had an ivc filter placed as treatment of recurrent pe.  the day after the filter was placed she developed a ventricular arrhythmia and became hypoxic.  she was subsequently transferred to wnc and admitted.  on admission her vital signs were stable and she was without arrhythmias or shortness of breath.
discussion (include references): 

indications for placement of an ivc filter include patients who have pe or dvt but also have contraindications for anticoagulation therapy (such as stroke, hemorrhage, neoplasm, active bleeding, unsteady gate etc.)  also, as in this case, patients with recurrent pe despite adequate anticoagulation therapy are candidates for an ivc filter.  the mean diameter of the ivc is 19-20 mm; approximately 3% of patients have a megacava in which the diameter is greater than 28 mm.  this subset of the population is at risk for ivc migration.  migrations are rare (lass than 5%) and are typically less than 3 mm.  a distant migration into the heart is extremely rare.  on the rare occasion of a migration to the heart, patients require surgical excision of the filter.
