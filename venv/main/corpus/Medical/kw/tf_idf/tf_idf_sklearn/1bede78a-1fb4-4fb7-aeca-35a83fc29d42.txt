the patient is following up with a chiropractor, a neurologist, and a psychiatrist. the chiropractor is helping him with his cervical and lumbar back pain. the neurologist has prescribed him amitriptyline for his headaches and deplin for his mthfr mutation. deplin is l-methylfolate, which is the product of a functioning mthfr gene and is meant as a supplement to his lower functioning mthfr protein. the psychiatrist has prescribed cymbalta, but the patient is unsure why he is taking it. the cymbalta may be for sleep or any component of radicular pain he may have. the patient has had several lab tests that were all negative, including tests for homocystinuria, which is associated with his mthfr gene mutations. he has had a ct scan and an mri of his head. the ct showed a small hyperdensity in his left cerebellum, which could represent a small hemorrhagic contusion from the mva. the mri showed two small hyperintensities in his left parietal and right frontal lobes. these may represent small vessel disease and could therefore support a diagnosis of vascular dementia, possibly partially due to his mthfr gene mutations. the hyperdensity on ct is not visualized on mri, which may indicate that the small hemorrhagic contusion has resolved.

post-concussive syndrome due to mild tbi
the patient’s cognitive difficulties, including word finding difficulties and comprehension difficulties, could be post-concussive symptoms from a mild traumatic brain injury. this diagnosis would also fit with his headache, dizziness, nausea, and trouble sleeping. some of his cognitive difficulties may be due to his mthfr gene mutation, which has been linked to vascular dementia and depression. although he denies depression, he is having sleep difficulties and he is taking cymbalta. his mri showed some hyperintensities that are consistent with vascular dementia, as discussed below in the follow up section. the fatigability of his eye muscles may be due to his mild tbi, as some patients experience ocular symptoms such as diplopia. this symptom is also a common early finding in myasthenia gravis. early myasthenia gravis often affects the eye muscles and manifests commonly as fatigability with prolonged upward gaze. 

diagnoses: 
post-concussive syndrome due to mild tbi
whiplash injury
mthfr gene mutation
lumbago due to spondylosis of lumbar spine
the patient is a 56 year old male with a recent history of motor vehicle collision in september 201x. he reports that he was stopped at a stop sign and was rear-ended. he was wearing a seatbelt at the time. his forehead struck the steering wheel and he sustained a forehead laceration. he had no loss of consciousness, but he reports that he was walking around after the accident in an effort to prevent himself from “passing out.” since the accident, he reports word finding difficulty and problems with comprehension that have improved in the last few weeks. he also feels dizzy, nauseous, and reports retching in the morning two times in the last week. he denies vomiting. his dizziness is worse when walking up and down stairs, and he reports walking slowly due to dizziness when he was leaving the hospital after being evaluated for the motor vehicle collision. he also reports having bruises on his forehead and around his eyes after the accident. he has had a constant headache since the accident, which he rated 9/10 at the time of the accident, but it has now improved to a 6/10. he reports that the headache sometimes wake him up from a sound sleep. the headache is worse when he bends over, and is improved by taking ibuprofen before he goes to sleep every night. he reports trouble sleeping and not feeling rested when he wakes up in the morning. he has had photophobia, phonophobia, and neck stiffness/pain with flexion. he denies numbness or tingling in his arms. he denies feeling depressed, but he is taking cymbalta and amitriptyline. he reports that his left eye wanders when he gets tired, and that he is unable to look up with his left eye for an extended period of time. he denies chest pain, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain.

past medical history: 
he has a history of lower back pain and radicular pain down his left leg due to spondylosis in his lumbar spine. he was recently diagnosed with two different mthfr polymorphisms (c677t and a1298c). he reports that he was diagnosed with these gene mutations by the psychiatrist he was sent to by his neurologist, but he denies any psychiatric symptoms including anxiety or depression. he had a tubular adenoma removed on colonoscopy one year ago. he reports having been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea via a sleep study. he denies any history of hypertension or diabetes.

mthfr is a recently recognized risk factor for numerous common diseases, such as hypertension, heart failure, vascular dementia, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, venous thrombosis, endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, depression, bipolar disorder, and miscarriages. it is also associated with spina bifida, anencephaly, and homocystinuria. since the patient has two mutated alleles, he is at increased risk of developing these conditions. some of his symptoms may be related to early vascular dementia accelerated by his mthfr mutations, as there are some lesions on his mri that are consistent with this condition. he also seemed to have some mild cognitive slowing during the clinical encounter, which may be related to possible early vascular dementia from his mthfr. his cognitive symptoms may also be related to the mild tbi he sustained in his recent motor vehicle accident. symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, nausea, and comprehension difficulties are common in mild tbi patients, and the fact that some of his cognitive symptoms such as his word finding difficulties have resolved supports a diagnosis of mild tbi with post-concussive syndrome. another mri to determine whether the hyperintense lesions on his previous mri have resolved or developed into hemosiderin deposits may help distinguish mtbi from early vascular dementia in this case. if the lesions have resolved or developed into hemosiderin deposits, that would support mtbi with resolving brain contusion and if they remain, it would support vascular white matter changes that may represent early vascular dementia accelerated by his mthfr mutation. his new symptoms of eye muscle fatigability may also be a result of his mild tbi.  since fatigability with upward gaze is a common finding in early myasthenia gravis, an anti-acetylcholine receptor test may be warranted to rule out this disease.
