technique:  the basic requirements for producing a high quality double contrast barium enema include proper mucosal coating, adequate bowel distension and filming in projections which produce double contrast views of the entire colon.

the initial requirement is that the colon is adequately cleansed.  the selected cleansing preparation should not leave excess fluid in the colon as this degrades mucosal coating.  a general regimen for satisfactory colon cleansing  includes 24 hours of clear liquids only, prior to the examination.  laxatives (magnesium citrate followed after 2-3 hours by 4 bisacodyl tablets) are administered the afternoon or evening prior to the exam.  the patient should have nothing by mouth after midnight on the day of the exam.  a bisacodyl suppository is used in the morning before the patient comes for the examination.

barium preparations designed for double contrast examination are high density (approximately 100% w/v) suspensions.  they are by nature of relatively high viscosity, but preparations of as low a viscosity as possible are preferable for adequate flow and drainage.  enema bags with large bore tubing containing a catheter for air insufflation is used.  glucagon (1.0 mg iv) is used in selected cases to reduce spasm and/or patient discomfort.

the barium (300-500 cc) is instilled under fluoroscopic guidance with the patient in prone or left side down position until the barium passes through the splenic flexure.  some barium may then be drained.  air is insufflated.  the patient is turned during this time so that the barium column remains ahead of the air.  at least one 360 degree rotation is required to maneuver the barium into the cecum.  the barium may be drained several times and air then re-insufflated to achieve the best possible coating and distension.  if too much barium remains, obscured and inadequate double contrast views will be obtained.

a series of spot films and then overhead films are obtained so that all portions of the colon are examined in double contrast.  spot films should include prone and lateral (film .2) or upright views of the rectum, the entire sigmoid (one or more films), erect views of both flexures and the cecum.  the cecum must be identified by the filling of the appendix or terminal ileum or identification of the ileocecal value (film .3).

overhead radiographs:  several sequences are acceptable as long as all portions of the colon are adequately seen.  our routine includes seven views.  these include prone (posteroanterior [pa] or anteroposterior [ap]), right posterior supine oblique, left posterior supine oblique, right lateral decubitus (horizontal beam), left lateral decubitus (horizontal beam), prone cross-table rectum (horizontal beam), and prone angle rectosigmoid (about 35 degrees caudad).  note that portions of the colon which are filled with dense barium in some views will be seen in double contrast on complementary views.  the prone angle view opens up overlapping loops of sigmoid.  film .4 demonstrates a carcinoma of the sigmoid (arrow) in a region which is often obscured on other views.  the horizontal beam films play a critical role in double contrast radiography as retained debris tends to fan into the dependent barium pool and provide clear views of the coated mucosal surfaces (films .1 and .5).
double contrast barium enema:  technique and anatomy.
double contrast barium enema:  technique and anatomy - the films were selected from different patients to best demonstrate the anatomy of the colon and the technique for performing a double contrast barium enema.

for the first part of the exercise, identify the normal structures (a-k) identified on the films (films .1 - .3).
