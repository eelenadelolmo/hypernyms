grade 2 anterior spondylolisthesis at the level of l4/l5.
grade 2 spondylolisthesis with apophyseal joint degenerative changes
51 year-old caucasian female with progressive low back pain.
this 51-year-old female who had back pain and the radiographs and ct showed significant levoscoliosis and grade 2 anterior spondylolisthesis at l4/l5 with degenerative changes secondary to apophyseal joint disease.  it is difficult to determine definitively the grade of displacement on the radiograph due to the rotatory component. acr codes: 4.9
the term spondylolisthesis originated in the 18th century. in 1882, franz ludwig neubebauer described spondylolisthesis in women who had died during labor due to difficulties resulting from narrow birth canals. the word is of greek origin, spondylo meaning spine and listhesis meaning slippage or slip. 
spondylolisthesis is defined as a displacement of a superior vertebra in relation to the inferior one. the most common type of spondylolisthesis occurs due to fracture of the pars interarticularis, with l5/s1 being the most frequent level. a grading system that is commonly used describes a grade 1 as displacement of 25% or less of the involved vertebra, grade 2 is displacement greater than 25% and up to 50%, grade 3 is displacement greater than 50% and up to 75% and grade 4 is greater than 75% displacement and up to 100% displacement. 
because spondylolisthesis typically occurs at levels below the spinal cord, the condition is rarely fatal. however, besides low back pain, nerve root involvement is common, especially because of compression from the inferior articular process. other common presentations besides musculoskeletal pain and radiculopathy are related to degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis when present. 
as mentioned previously, there are different etiologies of spondylolisthesis. the most common, occurring nearly 80% of the time, is type ii, or spondylolytic spondylolisthesis (also known as isthmic). this commonly follows spondylolysis, often as a result of athletic activity (common athletics include diving, gymnastics, and wrestling). type i is congenital, or dysplastic, and is a defect involving the facet joint that allows displacement. type iii is due to degenerative changes and is common in older patients. type iv is traumatic and can be included in type 2, but also includes trauma that causes displacement but that does not involve the pars interarticularis. lastly, type v is pathologic spondylolisthesis, such as displacement following a fracture due to a neoplasm. 
lateral radiographs are often excellent for diagnosing and grading sponylolisthesis, especially when the displacement is anterior/posterior. oblique views are also helpful to view the pars interarticularis, which is often described as a “scotty dog” (the eye is the pedicle, the ear is the superior articular process, and a fracture of the par interarticularis is described as the collar and appears as a lucency). ct imaging is often used to confirm the diagnosis as well as to better define bony defects, whether it be a fracture of the pars interarticularis, fractures elsewhere allowing displacement, or other bony anomalies. mr imaging is used to image soft tissue, such as nerve root involvement, spinal stenosis, and disc disorders. 
spondylolisthesis is common; 5% of adults have a degree of displacement. spondylolysis involvement is twice as common in men compared to women, and etiologies such as dysplastic and degenerative are more common in women. eskimos have an incidence as high as 50% in adults for reasons unknown. 
treatments are typically performed by orthopedic surgeons or neurosurgeons when symptoms and disability are determined severe enough. treatment includes fixation with hardware and fusion of the involved vertebra. there are no interventional radiological treatments yet.
