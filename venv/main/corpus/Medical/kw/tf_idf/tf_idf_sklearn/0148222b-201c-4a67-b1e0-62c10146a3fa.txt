lumbar radiculopathy due to lumbar disc herniation, protrusio acetabuli
the patients lower back pain was described as sharp and shooting from the lower back down to the right foot.  the pain is worse with lifting, walking, standing, twisting of waist.  pain is improved with pain medication, rest, and muscle relaxants.
the prominent physical exam findings showed limited rom of the lumbar spine.  weakness of the right flexor/extensor hallucis.  diminished achilles reflex.  patient had electrophysiological studies done, which did not show evidence of lumbar radiculopathy.   the electrophysiological studies showed several bilateral lower extremity sensory motor peripheral polyneuropathy with primary demyelinating features and further studies to determine the etiology were pending.  the studies also showed no signs of radiculopathy.
with the findings in history and physical exam the differential includes lumbar radiculopathy possibly due to disc herniation  or lumbar subluxation.  the radiculopathy the patient is experiencing may also be from a chronic process such as degenerative disc disease or spinal stenosis.  a less likely diagnosis for the patients back pain would be lumbar strain because the patient presented with radiating shooting pain.  the diagnosis of polyneuropathy is high on the differential because of the electrophysiological study findings.  
the imaging findings confirm the diagnosis that there is left sided disc herniation at l4-l5 and central disc herniation at l5-s1.  the left sided disc herniation is most likely causing chemical radiculopathy which lead to the radicular symptoms on the right side.  the central disc herniation at the l5 nerve root would support compressive radiculopathy that is causing symptoms on the right limb.  weakness of right flexor hallucis, and diminished achilles supports lumbar radiculopathy as the working diagnosis.
as for the patient’s localized hip pain, the differential includes fracture, trochanteric bursitis, and osteoarthritis, referred lumbosacral back pain.
the imaging findings show old fracture deformity of protrusion acetabuli.  no acute fracture was noted and internal fixation device from previous fracture repair was intact.  therefore, the right hip pain is likely due to protrusion acetabula or referred lumbosacral back pain

this patient presented with neck, back, and hip pain after a motor vehicle accident.  the lower back pain was described as shooting down to the right foot.  this describes lumbar radiculopathy is when there is compression of the lumbar nerve root (1). the patient’s symptamtology and physical exam findings support the diagnosis for lumbar radiculopathy.  the shooting pain down the leg, weakness of right flexor and extensor hallus, diminished achilles reflex, positive reverse straight leg raise.
the patient’s imaging findings show that there is compression of the l4 and l5 nerve root due to disc herniation.  l4 radiculopathy presents with lower back that often radiates to the anterior aspect of the thigh down into the knee and occasionally down the medial aspect of the lower leg.  examination can show weakness of hip flexion, hip extension, and hip adduction.  sensation may also be reduced over the anterior aspect of the thigh down to the medial aspect of the lower leg. patient’s that do present with weakness often have diminished patellar reflex (2).
l5 radiculopathy is the most common radiculopathy affecting lumbar spine.  it typically presents with lower back that radiates down to the lateral aspect of the leg into the foot.  on examination, there can be weakness of foot dorsiflexion toe extension, foot inversion, and foot eversion.  there may also be weakness of leg abduction in severe cases.  sensory loss is on the lateral aspect of the lower leg and dorsum of the foot.  reflexes are generally normal (2).
the patient presented with lower back that radiated down to the foot, which is consistent with l5 radiculopathy.   the weaknesses of the right flexor and extensor hallus are consistent with l5 radiculopathy.  the patient also had 1+ patellar reflex consistent with l4 radiculopathy.  the patient did not present with any sensory deficits.
however, with the patient’s history of prior hip fracture and the imaging findings of the pelvic showing protrusion acetabula, it may be difficult differentiating the patient’s pain pattern from arising from protrusio acetabula versus lumbar radiculopathy.
the hip pain may be due to the protrusion acetabula or referred pain from the lumbosacral spine.   the lower lumbar roots refer pain to the gluteas and posterolateral areas.  referred pain from the back should be suspected because the pain that shoots down his lower leg extends past the knee and examination of the hip joints were unremarkable (3).  
another helpful diagnostic measure is the physical exam maneuvers to help differentiate hip pain from referred lumbar sacral spine pain.  the patient was unable to perform the straight leg raise on the right side due the inability to place the thigh flat on the table.  the straight leg raise is more sensitive and less specific than the reverse straight leg raise for diagnosing disc herniation (4).  the test is most useful in evaluating l5 and s1 nerve root compression.  one prospective test showed that out of the 100 patients with disc herniation, the positive straight leg raise was positive in 83 percent (6).  
nerve conduction studies and electromyography may help differentiate from localized hip pain and lumbar radiculopathy.  the utility of these studies are when patients present with lumbar radiculopathy along with weakness for greater than three weeks.  for patients with non specific back pain, these studies can be used to differentiate nerve pain from pain related to muscular effort.  emg and imaging studies have comparable sensitivities varying between 50-85 percent , depending on patient population (2,6).  the patient's emg studies were negative for radiculopathy, but clinically the patient shows signs for radiculopathy.
the imaging for disc herniation through ct and mri reveals both are sensitive (7).   mri is used as routine initial assessment because it can detect intraspinal pathology such as inflammatory, malignant, and vascular disorders.  the patient had an mri of the lumbar spine which was able to confirm the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation.
diagnosis of protrusion acetabuli is made on the basis of an anteroposteior radiograph of the pelvis and in this case further defined by the ct scan of the right hip.  a center-edge angle of greater than 40 degrees is diagnostic and migration of the femoral head past  the medial wall of the acetabulum and the ilioischial line (kohlers line) (8).  these findings are seen in the patient anteroposterior radiographs of the pelvis.  overall sensitivity of needle emg in the diagnosis of radiculopathy is in the range of 50% and 71%. based on these sensitivities, it is important to recognize that a negative emg study does not rule out the presence of radiculopathy [9].
