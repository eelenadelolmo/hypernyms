Texto: 
firm, tender mass of the posterior right knee.
normal cbc, metabolic panel, and liver enzymes.
mass was surgically resected with no further evidence of metastasis on follow-up studies.
radiographs:  large mass with well defined margins emanating from posterior cortex of the distal right femur.  radiolucent line, visible on the lateral radiograph separates tumor from cortex .

mri:  posterior cortical surface distal femoral diaphysis mass, 7.3cm x 6.7cm x 8.3cm, with heterogeneous signal intensity.  on t1-weighted mr image shows a heterogenously low signal intensity mass signal. t2-weighted mr image shows a well-defined parosteal mass juxtaposed to the cortex with heterogenous high signal intensity mass posterior to it.  t2 post gadolinium study shows low signal intensity in posterior mass correlating with high signal intensity region on t2 image consistent with necrosis.  ossification center at base of mass adjacent to cortical bone.  no popliteal vessel invasion, no adjacent soft tissue invasion.  no femoral distant metastasis.

24 y/o male with right posterior knee mass
parosteal osteosarcomas are uncommon malignant bone tumors that account for approximately 3% of osteosarcomas.  they occur in adults between the 2nd and 5th decades and affect both males and females equally.  they typically present with insidious onset of symptoms of pain, swelling, and a palpable mass.  the large size of many of these tumors on presentation is due to a delay in the patient consulting a physician because of the slow onset of symptoms.  parosteal osteosarcomas occur nearly exclusively in long tubular bones, most commonly in the femur, which accounts for 65% of cases.  in this bone, they typically arise on the posterior surface of the distal femur in the metaphyseal region.

on plain radiographs, parosteal osteosarcomas appear as a large radiodense, oval or spheroid mass with smooth lobulated or irregular margins, attached in a sessile manner to a possibly thickened external cortex.  a thin radiolucent line or cleavage plane separates the tumor from the underlying bone and is caused by a 2-3mm fibrous membrane.  as the lesion grows in size, the radiolucent line is obscured by the tumor growing circumferentially around the bone.

ossification of the tumor extends from the base of the lesion to its periphery in contrast to myositis ossificans, which, when mature, shows a zonal pattern with peripheral ossification.

on ct images, foci of radiolucencies in the superficial parts of the tumor may represent low-grade malignant cartilaginous, fibrous tissue, or entrapped fat and trabeculae, whereas, more central radiolucencies may correlate with high-grade dedifferentiated tumor.

mri should be done to evaluate the extent of the tumor. 

at imaging studies, parosteal sarcoma  should be differentiated from myositis ossificans, sessile osteochondroma, periosteal osteosarcoma, and ossifying soft tissue tumors arising from the cortical bone surface.

myositis ossificans may present with a history of trauma followed by rapid development of a soft tissue mass, which ossifies at the periphery initially as opposed to the base.

sessile osteochondroma should show a continuity between both the cortex and spongiosa of the underlying normal bone.  

periosteal osteosarcoma is smaller and has a distinctive spiculated periosteal reaction.  

other ossifying masses from the cortex such as chondrosarcomas, high-grade osteosarcomas and osteoma should be differentiated by their combined imaging, clinical and histologic findings.  

the treatment of parosteal sarcoma is surgical resection without adjuvant chemotherapy.

the major prognostic factors are the grade of the lesion and presence of intramedullary involvement.  low-grade lesions have a better prognosis than high-grade lesions.  intramedulary invasion has a poor prognosis.  it is extremely rare for distant metastasis to occur without intramedulary involvement.

another poor prognostic factor is progressive dedifferentiation from low-grade to high-grade osteosarcoma.  this has been reported to develop with recurrence after surgical resection or with undetected conventional parosteal osteosarcoma over a long period of time.  the incidence of dedifferentiation of parosteal osteosarcomas is reported can be as frequent as 20-25% of patients.  the posterior aspect of the femur is the usual site for dedifferentiated osteosarcoma.

as mentioned earlier, parosteal osteosarcoma is the most favorable osteosarcoma variant.  patients with conventional parosteal osteosarcoma typically do well after resection with a long-term survival rate of 80-90%.
