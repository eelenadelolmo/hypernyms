no palpable nodules, skin changes, or nipple discharge were noted on clinical breast exam.
birads category 2: benign findings.

continue annual screening mammography.
a comparison right breast mlo view from a screening mammogram performed three years ago shows scattered fibroglandular elements and no mammographic evidence of malignancy.  this mammogram was performed before the motor vehicle accident.


new screening mammogram:
1. an mlo view of the right breast (from a screening mammogram performed three years later) shows new increased density in the posterior third of the upper half of the right breast.  this mammogram happened to have been performed 1-2 months following a motor vehicle accident. a six month follow up right diagnostic mammogram was recommended.

2. a cc view of the right breast (from a screening mammogram performed three years later) shows new increased density in the posterior third of the inner half of the right breast.  this mammogram happened to have been performed 1-2 months following a motor vehicle accident. a six month follow up right diagnostic mammogram was recommended.


six month follow up right diagnostic mammogram:
1. an mlo view of the right breast shows multiple new scattered coarse and round calcfications in the upper portion of the right breast.  additionally, several new round, well-circumscribed, lucent-centered nodules are noted in the anterior third of the upper outer quadrant of the right breast consistent with traumatic oil cysts.  the previously noted increased density in the upper portion of the right breast has resolved, and no new suspicious masses, areas of architectural distortion, or skin changes are noted.

2. an mlo view of the right breast shows multiple new scattered coarse and round calcfications in the upper portion of the right breast.  additionally, several new round, well-circumscribed, lucent-centered nodules are noted in the anterior third of the upper outer quadrant of the right breast consistent with traumatic oil cysts.  the previously noted increased density in the upper portion of the right breast has resolved, and no new suspicious masses, areas of architectural distortion, or skin changes are noted.

3. a 6-month follow up mlo view of the right breast shows multiple new scattered coarse and round calcifications in the upper half of the right breast.  additionally, several new round, well-circumscribed lucent-centered nodules  are seen in the anterior third of the upper outer quadrant of the right breast; these are consistent with traumatic oil cysts.  the increased density in the upper right breast, seen on the prior mammogram from six months ago, has resolved, and no new suspicious masses, areas of architectural distortion, or skin changes are noted. 


the diagram shows how a seatbelt overlies the chest and would exert pressure over the upper inner quadrant of a pendulous right breast in a motor vehicle accident.  the resulting pressure pattern corresponds with the mammographic abnormalities seen in this patient.
fat necrosis with traumatic oil cysts.
based on the history, fat necrosis is the leading diagnosis.

differential diagnostic considerations for oil cysts include lipomas and galactoceles.
differential diagnostic considerations for the initial appearance of unilateral increased density over the right breast include mastitis, inflammatory or invasive lobular breast carcinoma, normal asymmetric glandular tissue, and lymphangitic spread of disease.
the patient presented for screening mammography approximately 1-2 months after having been involved in a motor vehicle accident.  at the time of the accident, the patient was driving the vehicle and was wearing a seatbelt.
the clinical history and interval changes in the mammographic appearance of the right breast with the development of oil cysts and coarse benign-appearing calcifications, in this patient with a history of breast trauma in this location, are most consistent with fat necrosis.
