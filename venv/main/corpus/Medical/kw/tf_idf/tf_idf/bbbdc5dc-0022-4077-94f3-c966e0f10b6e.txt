he arrived with a glasgow coma score of 15 and hypotensive.  physical exam on arrival revealed injuries consistent with the blast including multiple injuries to the face, left flank, back, left lower extremity, and an open distal tibia and fibula fracture with a retained foreign body.  

the bronchoscopy was notable for mild mucosal inflammation and a finding of yellow “mud” adherent to both the tracheal wall and the upper bronchi.
the victim was facing the blast when it went off. the patient was evacuated to ??????.  the patient was intubated in the emergency department for declining respiratory status, and taken to the operating room for external fixation and wound debridement.   following surgery, the patient was taken to the icu and extubated. 
 
on hospital day 2, copious thick fluid described as “muddy” was suctioned from the respiratory tract, at which time a well tolerated bronchoscopy was performed and ct imaging of the chest was obtained.

empiric antibiotic coverage with meropenim for actinobacter was started, as well as levoquin and cefazolin.  the patient was transferred to the ward from icu on hospital day 2 following improvement in his respiratory status.  over the next several days the patient was taken back to the operating room for revision and further repair of extremity injuries.   he continued to recover, and was discharged on hospital day 14 with no further pulmonary complications.
the chest x-ray was "negative" and is not included in this report. 

chest ct imaging, obtained with the patient lying supine, revealed radiopaque material lining the dependant portions of the trachea as well as the main stem bronchi and bronchioles.  

no particulate matter was noted within the sinuses.
sand aspiration
• sand aspiration
• drowning
• blast lung
a 34 year old man injured by a blast - he was facing the explosion when it went off.
sand aspiration has been previously associated with drowning, cave in, and accidental burial.  it can be a fatal complication due to obstruction of the airway and subsequent anoxic death.   however, to the authors knowledge, it has not previously been associated with blast injuries. 
the patient described in this report suffered a blast injury, rather than submersion near-drowning or a variation of cave in.  this different primary mechanism of injury necessitates consideration of pulmonary damage due to barotrama secondary to the blast itself.  further, the patient exhibited multiple additional wounds, consistent with close exposure to an explosive device.  blast lung, as the condition has been termed, is the second most common manifestation of primary organ damage in blast injuries and is due to the pressure differential across the alveolar-capillary interface.  pulmonary injury can be sustained without evidence of external thoracic injury when the pressure wave carries sufficient force to compress the chest wall posteriorly against the spine.  the result is a transient elevation in intrathoracic pressure.  the classic imaging finding in pulmonary barotrauma, not present in this case, is described as a bihilar “butterfly” pattern consistent with pulmonary contusion.  additional findings may include pulmonary infiltrates, pneumothorax, and hemothorax among others.
