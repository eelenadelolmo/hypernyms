Texto: 
the patient had no scleral icterus, a soft, non-tender, non-distended abdomen with a negative murphy's sign.  

the patient developed a leukocytosis with new onset bandemia after admission to the hospital.

his echinococcal serolodiagnostics (elisa) were negative.
the patient was treated prophylactically with zosyn and albendazole for tens days while awaiting serology for hydatid disease - that was negative.  the pyogenic hepatic abscess was then treated with therapeutic and diagnostic percutaneous drainage under ultrasound guidance.  

after drainage, the patient was placed on a four-week course of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin.  cultures of the aspirate were negative, likely due to the patient's prior treatment with antibiotics before drainage.
•ct – helically-acquired images obtained through the liver, before and after the administration of iodinated intravenous contrast material.

there is an approximately 7 cm diameter multiloculated fluid collection within the anterior segment of the right love of the liver.  the wall of the fluid collection measures up to 7 mm thick.

•mrcp – (mri/mra liver performed at 1.5 tesla superconducting magnet using 3 plane localizer, coronal ssfse, axial and out of phase gradient echo scan, axial t2-weighted frfse, and 3 mrcp images with oblique and additional reformatted images.

there is a multiloculated thick walled cystic collection or mass in the right lobe of the liver.   the thick rim is of soft tissue signal.  the contents have fluid signal with low attenuation on t1 and bright on t2-weighted images.  there is surrounding heterogenous attenuation liver parenchyma.  the right hepatic duct, left hepatic duct, common hepatic and common bile ducts are normal.  there is no direct connection between the cystic mass or collection and the central biliary ducts.
pyogenic hepatic abscess
• pyogenic abscess
• amoebic abscess
• echinococcal cyst (hydatid disease)
a 48 year old man presented with mild chest pain and was initially ruled out for myocardial infarction.  during his subsequent hospital stay, he developed waxing and waning right upper quadrant pain and sporadic fevers.  a right upper quadrant ultrasound was negative.  the patient's past medical history was significant for only hypertension, but his social history revealed frequent travel throughout the middle east, russia, and southeast asia, often eating local foods.
our patient initially presented with atypical chest pain prior to developing recurring fevers and waxing and waning right upper quadrant pain.  cholecystitis was initially suspected and ruled out with a negative right upper quadrant ultrasound.  ct revealed a multiloculated fluid collection within the anterior segment of the right lobe of the liver.  a subsequent mrcp determined that the fluid collection was notcontiguous with the biliary system. 

with our patient’s extensive travel history, suspicion for echinococcal cyst (hydatid disease) was high.  our patient’s serological testing for hydatid disease was negative, making pyogenic hepatic abscess a much more likely diagnosis.  

percutaneous drainage under ultrasound guidance was conducted, without the need for drain placement.  the aspirate was viewed under microscopy immediately and presumed to be pyogenic due to multiple polymultinuclear cells.  there were no protoslices seen on microscopy and the initial gram stain was negative.  cultures of the aspirate were negative, as the patient had been treated with antibiotics prior to drainage.
