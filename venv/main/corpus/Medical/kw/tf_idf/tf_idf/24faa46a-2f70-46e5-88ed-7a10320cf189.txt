patient was obese with abdominal bruit appreciated on physical exam.  laboratory values were remarkable for a triglyceride level of 246, hdl of 25 and vldl of 49.  the remainder of the laboratory work up was negative.
patient initially underwent 6 month follow up cts to assess for stablitiy of the aneurysm.  type ii endoleaks can be followed as long as the aneurysm sac does not increase in size.  the sac did demonstrate interval increase in size to a maximum diamter of 5.4 cm at one-year follow up.  the initial treatment undertaken was laparoscopic ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery. this was unsuccessful and the next intervention was angiography and embolization of the lumbar arteries.  this proved to be successful.
ct imaging through the abdomen prior to stent placement demonstrates fusiform aneurysmal dilatation of the abdominal aorta in the infrarenal portion.  the dilatation ends approximately 1 cm above the aortic bifurcation.  the maximum diameter of the aneurysm is 4.1 cm.  thrombotic plaque is present with the aneurysm. 

post stent placement imaging demonstrates an intact stent graft which extends from the infrarenal level into both iliacs without evidence of leak at the distal or proximal ends.  the renal arteries appear widely patent and well opacified.  there is curvilinear dense contrast material which extends anteriorly from the left aspect of the stent graft in the superior most aspect of the aneurysm.  this is most consistent with a type ii endoleak.
type ii endograft leak
endograft leak
67-year old male with history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, which was first diagnosed in 1998.  the patient was lost to follow up until 2003.  repeat imaging at that time demonstrated an increase in the size of the aneurysm to a maximum diamter of 5.4 cm.
risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture is related to the size of the aneurysm, with a reported annual risk of rupture between 5-10% for aneurysms measuring between 5 and 6 cm.  repair of aneurysms can be accomplished with open surgical repair or via endovascular stent graft placement.  the most common complication that occurs after endovascular stent graft placement is persistent arterial flow within the aneurysm sac, also known as an endoleak.  the reported incidence of endoleak is 3-44%.  there are five distinct types of endoleaks with type ii being the most common.  this type of leak occurs secondary to retrograde flow into the aneurysm sac from patent side branches, usually lumbar arteries or the inferior mesenteric artery.   

ct angiography is the primary method for imaging and evaluating patients after stent graft placement.  when a type ii endoleak is identified on ct, it can be managed with embolization or observation, in the hope that the endoleak will seal spontaneously.  in this case, an endoleak was observed.  however, the patient was followed with serial ct scans until increase of the aneurysm sac was identified.  at this point the patient underwent ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery, which was not successful in stopping the leak.  angiography and embolization was then performed of the lumbar arteries, which was successful in stopping the leak.
