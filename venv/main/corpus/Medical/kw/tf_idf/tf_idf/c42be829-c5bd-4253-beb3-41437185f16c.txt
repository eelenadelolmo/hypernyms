patient presents utilizing a cane but states that she did so before the mva as well.   

active range of motion of the cervical spine revealed flexion to 60o/50o, right rotation to 50o/80o, left rotation to 55o/80o, left lateral bending to 25o/45o, right lateral bending to 25o/45o and extension to 40o/60o.  she reported cervicothoracic pain with all ranges of motion.  
on inspection there is a 11 cm scar over the anterior left shoulder from previous surgery.  she reports that prior to the mva she had full elevation of the left shoulder.  active range of motion of the shoulders revealed the left shoulder could be elevated to 110o with report of left shoulder pain.  

neer’s testing was positive on the left at 110o with report of left shoulder pain.  the hawkins-kennedy procedure was negative bilaterally.  the supraspinatus test was positive on the left side.  

postural evaluation revealed a low left shoulder and a low right hip.  
active range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine revealed flexion to 60o/90o, left and right lateral bending to 10o/25o, and extension to 10o/25o.  low back pain was reported with all ranges of motion. 
the subpatellar and achilles reflex were graded 0/4 bilaterally.  she was unable to toe or heel walk due to pain in the left foot.  

the figure 4 procedure on the left produced report of left hip pain.  the straight leg raise on the left side could be performed to 30o with report of lower back and left lower extremity pain extending to the foot.  the right straight leg raise on the right side could be performed to 60o with report of lower back pain.  
percussion and posterior to anterior compression of the spine produced report of pain over the cervicothoracic and lumbosacral regions.  hypomobility was noted at the cervicothoracic and lumbosacral regions. muscle spasm was noted over the cervicothoracic and lumbosacral regions paraspinally. pain/tenderness, asymmetry/misalignment, abnormal range of motion, and tissue/tone changes were associated with the areas of hypomobility.
patient is receiving chiropractic care for her back injuries involving estim to the cervicothoracic and lumbosacral regions, flexion distraction therapy, chiropractic manipulation, and quantum exercise to strengthen the lower back and core stabilizers.

this is a patient who presents with low back pain extending to the foot following a motor vehicle accident.  she was pain free prior to the event.  
due to her recent onset of symptoms an mri was ordered and evaluated.  
the mri revealed some pre-existing degenerative changes of the spine with schmorl's nodes, (a protrusion of disc material into the vertebral endplates, present at multiple levels).  additionally, there are broad-based, diffuse disc herniations at multiple disc levels.  the chronic degenerative changes suggest that these herniations could be chronic, however the patient was asymptomatic prior to her accident suggesting that the herniations are more acute.  in this case, making use of imaging findings to contribute to an understanding of the temporality of disc herniation.   
one means of doing so would be by use of the coin criteria.  the coin criteria is a means by which mri findings can be used to asses the degree of degeneration of a disc and whether a disc injury may be secondary to this degeneration or to an acute traumatic event.  in the case of this patient, the disc herniations present would be classified as a type 3 injury.  type 3 injury involve the herniation of an already degenerated nucleus pulposus through a degenerate annulus fibrosis.  the disc is not calcified which would suggest a chronic herniation.  because type 3 herniations occur in the presence of an already degenerated disc, it becomes important to attempt to determine whether the herniation resulted from the degeneration or from a traumatic event.  one aspect to consider is the anatomy of the herniation.  if the disc herniation is focal, lateral, or asymmetrical it is more likely to be associated with trauma while if the herniation is broad based it is more likely to be considered degenerative.  in the case of our patient the herniations are broad based.  another aspect to consider is bone marrow edema; its presence suggests acute injury.  our patient does not have bone marrow edema present.  another proposed indication of acuity of the injury is the presence of the hyper-intense zone (hiz).  it is possible that the presence of a hiz, an area of increased signal on t2 weighted images that is distinct from the nucleus pulposus, is an indication of a more recent injury as it represents further internal disc protrusion as well as an inflammatory process around a tear in the annulus fibrosis.  at this point no studies have been done to confirm this hypothesis, but further studies are needed.  our patient does have a hiz.  the final, and most important, aspect to consider when determining whether the herniation is an acute injury or more chronic, is to consider the patient's description of symptoms and presence of clinical findings. in our patient, she had been without back or leg pain prior to the injury.  following the injury, she developed a pattern of pain and neurological deficits that can be explained by disc herniations at l4-l5 and l5-s1 due to compressive or chemical means.  this suggests that the herniations were not present prior to the accident and were an acute result of the traumatic event.
