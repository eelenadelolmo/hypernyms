synonyms: pnet (primitive neuroectodermal tumor), central neuroblastoma 

cell of origin: 
cell of origin is not clear. several choices have been offered: 
1) 'medulloblasts' 
2) external granular cells 
3) subependymal matrix cells 
4) more than one cell of origin 

who grade(s): who 4 

genetics and associations: 

demographics (age, sex, incidence): 
peak age is 7, 70% <16 (30%>15), most adults <40 
65% male (~2:1 m:f) 
incidence - 0.5/100k in children (<15 yo) 

common locations: 
posterior fossa, usually midline 

gross appearance: 
varies from soft to firm, some are well defined, may be hemorrhagic 

radiology: 
relatively homogeneous, may be uniformly hyperdense on non-contrast ct. mr signal similar to gray-matter, most not bright on t2w mr 

histology: 
densely cellular, hyperchromatic "carrot-shaped" nuclei, high nuclear to cytoplasm ratio, neuroblastic rosettes 

special stains: 

prognosis and treatment: 
survival up to 85% at five years with combined radiation and chemotherapy [magnani c, pastore g: survival of childhood cancer patients in italy,1978-1989. itacare working group.tumori 1997 jan-feb;83(1):426-89.
