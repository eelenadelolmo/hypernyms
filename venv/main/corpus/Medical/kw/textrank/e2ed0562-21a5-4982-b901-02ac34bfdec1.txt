CT findings for pericardial cysts include:  a smooth, sharply marginated, fluid attenuation cyst which typically contacts the anterior chest wall, diaphragm, and heart. It is encapsulated by a very thin wall which may be difficult to see on CT. Higher internal cyst attenuation can be seen secondary to prior hemorrhage or infection.  Difficult or uncertain cases can be further evaluated by MRI.
