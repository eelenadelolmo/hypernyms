Shortness of breath prompted CTPA. Normal labs (including LFTs)
Recommend 3 month follow up to document stability vs tissue biopsy.
CTPA shows multiple, non enhancing hepatic low density lesions, 4-10 mm.
MR further characterizes these lesions as non enhancing, fluid signal lesions.
Von Meyenburg Complex - Multiple biliary hamartomas
Numerous hepatic cysts
Polycystic liver disease
Hepatic microabscesses
Multiple metastases
Choledochal cyst 4-5
45 yo female with multiple hepatic, non enhancing lesions seen on CTPA
Incidence: .15-2.8% of autopsies
Etiology: failure of involution of embryonic bile ducts
Associations: polycystic liver disease
Symptoms: asymptomatic

Bile duct hamartoma, aka von Meyenburg complex, is a benign tumor composed of disorganized bile ducts and ductules and fibrocollagenous stroma. Although bile duct hamartoma is benign, there have been reports of an association of cholangiocarcinoma with multiple bile duct hamartomas. 
Bile duct hamartoma has a nonspecific imaging appearance and can simulate metastases or microabscesses. Therefore, histologic diagnosis is required.
