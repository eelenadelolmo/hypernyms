53 YO Female with left shoulder pain
This most likely represents a case of calcific tendonitis caused by calcium hydroxyapatite crystal deposition disease.  No history of metabolic disease or arthritis was given.  

HADD is a common idiopathic disorder that occurs in up to 3% of adults between 40-70 years of age and affects both men and women.  Patients may be asymptomatic or present with shoulder pain as in this case.    HADD account for about 7% of painful shoulder syndromes.

Radiologic features include periarticular calcification that appear cloud like and poorly defined.  The deposits may become denser or disappear.  They may cause adjacent periosteal reaction, sclerosis, erosions, or  cystic changes in bone.  

HADD most commonly occurs in the humerus and femur and most commonly at the  juxtaarticular and diaphyseal locations.  Other locations may be affected.  In this case calcification was seen in the supraspinatous and pectoralis major tendons.
