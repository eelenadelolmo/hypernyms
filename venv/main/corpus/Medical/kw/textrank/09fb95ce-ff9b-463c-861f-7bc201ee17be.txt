Treatment usually includes amphotericin B or one of the azole drugs, which is normally itraconazole.  Some factors influencing treatment include 1) the clinical form and severity of the disease and 2) the immune status of the patient.  If the infection is severe, in the CNS, or systemic, a lipid formulation of amphotericin B is preferred.  If the disease state is mild or moderate and excludes the CNS, then itraconazole is the drug of choice.

If the patient is immunocompetent and presents with an acute infection, they may not require treatment at all.  If there is any possibility of an immunocompromised state, then amphotericin B should be promptly administered.

Any skin lesions may be mistaken for pyoderma gangrenosum or keratoacanthoma.
