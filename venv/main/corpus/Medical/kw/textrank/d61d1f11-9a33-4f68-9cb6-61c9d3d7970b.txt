newborn girl on day of life #1 with coagulopathy, delivered via C-section with large scalp hematoma.
The subgaleal hematoma is differentiated from a cephalohematoma because it crosses calvarium suture lines and extends into the nape of the neck.  A cephalohematoma is essentially a subperiosteal hematoma on the outer table of the skull.  A caput succedaneum is scalp edema, not hemorrhage.
