Physical Exam and Laboratory: 
Normal physical exam except for bilateral decreased range of motion of the hips and atalgic gait secondary to hip pain.  Laboratory studies showed mild macrocytic anemia and leukopenia.
Treatment and Follow-up: The patient is currently receiving chemotherapy via the POG 9906 protocol, currently a phase III randomized study of multidrug antimetabolite therapy in children recently diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia designated as high risk.  The protocol specifies a number of short bursts of steroids over the course of the 130-week regimen, which has been halted in this patient.
Imaging Findings: Anteroposterior (AP) radiograph of the hips at presentation was normal and showed normal mineralization with no evidence of subluxation, dislocation, fractures, or osteoblastic/osteolytic changes.  Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of both the right and left hips demonstrated subchondral low signal intensity of the femoral head on coronal T1 imaging, best seen on the left, that becomes high signal intensity on a coronal STIR (fat suppressed) image.  There was also increased signal intensity of the femoral neck, particularly the lateral margin, on STIR imaging.  A subsequent AP hip radiograph 2 months after presentation shows new subchondral fracture lucencies in the right and left femoral heads and mild flattening of the left superior head along with bilateral preserved joint space.  A year after presentation, an AP hip radiograph showed an increase in collapse of the left femoral head and bilateral early degenerative change of the hips.
Avascular Necrosis of Hip
Differential Diagnosis for these findings in this case:
Avascular necrosis secondary to steroid therapy
History (can include gestational age, or age in days, weeks, months): 18 year old male with a 1 year history of pre B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia currently on chemotherapy protocol that includes treatment with vincristine, methotrexate, prednisone/dexamethasone surges, and 6-MP. Patient complains of recent onset of bilateral hip pain.
Discussion (include references): Avascular necrosis of the hip may be a difficult diagnosis to make when a patient first presents with hip pain or mild gait abnormalities.  Initial radiographs of the hips may no show no changes, as in this case.  Therefore, clinical suspicion should be high for this disorder in a patient whose history suggests the diagnosis.  Avascular necrosis is caused by a number of etiologies including femoral neck fracture, alcohol use, sickle cell disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, radiation treatment, and prolonged corticosteroid administration, as in this patient.  Steroids have been implicated in about 20 to 35 percent of cases.  The occurrence also appears to be directly related to the dosage level and duration of the medication.  In decreasing order of frequency, the most common locations of steroid-induced avasular osteonecrosis are the femoral head, humeral head, the distal end of the femur, and the proximal part of the tibia.  

The pathogenesis of steroid-induced osteonecrosis is unclear.  However several mechanisms have been proposed and include both mechanical and vascular etiologies.  Osteoporosis resulting in microfractures and later bone collapse is one mechanical theory.  Vascular compromise due to hyperviscosity, vasculitis, fat embolization, and compression from marrow accumulation of relatively inelastic fat cells are also other possible causes.
  
The most common presenting symptom of avascular necrosis is pain.  Groin pain and less commonly thigh and buttock pain are seen in patients with femoral head involvement.  Patients may also complain of pain upon weight bearing.  Thirty to fifty percent have bilateral involvement.  Physical exam usually is nonspecific and may demonstrate limited range of motion particularly in abduction and internal rotation.

Radiographic evaluation of a patient with suspected osteonecrosis includes an AP and frog-leg radiograph of both hips.  As mentioned above, the initial radiographs may not show any evidence of disease.  Subsequently, radiographic findings show sclerosis, indistinctive trabecular pattern, and patchy osteoporosis.  Progressive radiograph findings include a crescentic subchondral line indicative of subchondral collapse, segmental flattening of the femoral head, and ultimately joint space narrowing, acetabular degenerative changes, and collapse of the femoral head.

MR imaging is the most sensitive test for detecting avascular necrosis.  As with this patient, MR imaging showed evidence of osteonecrosis prior to the radiographs.  T1-weighted images typically show a line of low signal intensity, which corresponds to the presence of granulation tissue and sclerotic bone.  T2-weighted images typically demonstrate a double line sign, which consists of a narrower line of low signal intensity that corresponds to bone sclerosis and an inner zone of high signal intensity that corresponds to granulation tissue.
