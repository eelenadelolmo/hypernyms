Physical exam was within normal limits at the time of study.  No neurological deficits were noted, nor were there any residual deficits from the suspected prior event at age 5.

Hemoglobin electrophoresis: 
HgS 25.6 %, HgA2 3.2%, HgF 1.7 %, HgA 69.2%

CBC:  WBC 12.0, Hgb 10.0, Hct 28.5, Plt 303
Treatment of Moyamoya is directed at the complications.  If an intracerebral hemorrhage has occurred, managment of hypertension is warranted.  If ischemia has occurred, anticoagulation and/or antithrombotic therapy should be considered.

Patients who present for treatment while symptoms are evolving have a better prognosis than those who present with static symptoms.

Various surgical procedures have been used: superficial temporal artery–middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis, encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS), encephaloduroarteriomyosynangiosis (EDAMS), pial synangiosis, and omental transplantation to the CNS.
There is significant vasculopathy compatible with sickle cell disease.  There is severe narrowing of the cavernous and supraclinoid portions of the left internal carotid artery and narrowing at the origins of the left A1 and left M1 segments of the internal carotid artery.  The left middle cerebral artery appears attenuated.  There is diminished flow identified at and distal to the trifurcation of the left middle cerebral artery.  

Moyamoya collateral vessels are again identified in the left basal ganglia region and also at the region of the bifurcation of the left internal carotid artery and the right cerebral peduncle region. 

The anterior and posterior branches of the middle menigeal arteries appear more prominent, reflecting collateral supply from the external carotid circulation.
Moyamoya Disease secondary to Sickle Cell Disease
• anterior circulation stroke
• basilar artery thrombosis
• blood dyscrasias
• Moya-moya disease
19 year old with sickle cell disease.  At 5 years of age, he presented with dysarthria, confusion, and mild right hemiparesis; and, had an apparently normal MRI at this time. Between the ages of 5 and 19, he has not had any symptomatic vascular events.  He presents now for follow up and screening exam for cerebrovascular pathology.
This patient has significant vasculopathy with some new development of collateralization.  There is increased signal within the frontal lobes implying low grade chronic ischemia.  These findings can manifest as problems with executive functioning, planning and organizing and can effect activities of daily living.  In this patient asynangiosis procedure is being considered, as well as, a Diamox challenge scan to fully assess candidacy.  He has been on chronic blood tranfusions with the hope of preventing further significant cerebrovascular events.

Of note, a study reported in Blood, 1 May 2002, noted that 'chronic transfusions are effective in preventing the recurrance of infarctive strokes in sickle cell disease (SCD).  The reasons why some patients develop recurrances while complying with transfusions are unknown.'  This study reported that 41% of SCD patients had a recurrent cerebrovascular event even with compliant transfusion therapy.  In addition, 'patients with moyamoya collaterals were found to be at higher risk for recurrent strokes and TIAs compared with patients without these collaterals.'  The authors mentioned some therapy options which this patient is currently not utilizing:  hydroxyurea and phlebotomy and bone marrow transplantation, all as options to decrease the risk of future CVA, as well as, prevention of worsening neuropsychological complications due to poor perfusion.
