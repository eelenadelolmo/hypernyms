Patient has generalized abdominal tenderness, however appears extremely uncomfortable on exam. after repeated doses of pain medication, patient remained uncomfortable.
Patient was immediately started on intravenous fluids, continued pain management, broad spectrum antibiotics. Emergent vascular surgeon consultation for thrombectomy and possible bowel resection and also emergent interventional-radiology consultation for catheter-directed thrombolysis.
CT angiogram of abdomen and Pelvis:
Acute superior mesenteric artery thrombus 5 centimeters distal from the origin of the aorta without any collateral circulation or runoff
Superior Mesenteric Artery Thrombus
Mesenteric Ischemia, appendicitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, small bowel obstruction, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm
Elderly female with sudden onset abdominal pain after eating, with history of atrial fibrillation not properly anticoagulated.
This case involves a classic presentation of acute mesenteric ischemia, which is defined as the sudden onset of abdominal pain due to small intestinal hypoperfusion secondary to reduction or complete occlusion of arterial blood flow to the intestines. The most common artery that results in mesenteric ischemia is the SMA. The main two reasons for this phenomenon are either due to an arterial embolus or from arterial thrombus from underlying atherosclerosis. Embolism to the mesenteric arteries is most frequently from a thrombus that breaks off from the left atrium, left ventricle or proximal aorta, as in this case from underlying atrial fibrillation that has not been properly anticoagulated. The embolus frequently lodges 3-10 cm distal to the origin of the SMA. The classic presentation of acute mesenteric ischemia involves an elderly patient, with underlying history of atrial fibrillation or peripheral arterial disease, presenting with sudden abdominal pain that is out of proportion to physical exam. These patients typically have subtherapeutic INR, post-prandial abdominal discomfort, elevated lactic acid, leukocytosis, and at times metabolic acidosis on laboratory values. This condition has an extremely high mortality rate.
