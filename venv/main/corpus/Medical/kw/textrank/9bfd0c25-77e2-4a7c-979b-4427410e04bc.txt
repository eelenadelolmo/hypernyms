Plain radiographs show mild osteoporosis of left femoral head, and small step-off at lateral aspect of left femoral head. MRI images show diffuse bone marrow edema (T1 dark, T2 bright) in left hip and proximal femur, and linear high T2 signal (and low t1 signal) in subchondral portion of the femoral head consistent with subchondral fracture.
Transient Osteoporosis of the Hip
Avascular Necrosis
Transient Osteoporosis of the Hip
Left hip pain several weeks before giving birth.  After delivery, incresed pain, necessitating wheelchair use for mobility for several weeks.
The difficulty with this case is trying to decide whether the findings represent avascular necrosis or transient osteoporosis. The patient had no risk factors for osteonecrosis. The subchondral fracture seen in this case can be explained by an injury occuring because of weakining of bone secondary to osteporosis.
