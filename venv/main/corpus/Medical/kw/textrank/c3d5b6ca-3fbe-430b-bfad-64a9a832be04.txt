Pulmonary Sequestration
cystic adenomatoid malformation
bronchiectasis
65 y/o WM with non-resolving cough and fever despite antibiotic therapy
While 90% of sequestrations are on the left side, this case is on the right. It is probably intralobar.
The feeding vessel was small and branched off the descending thoracic aorta.
