Plain radiographs obtained approximately one month prior to the pathologic fracture demonstrates that the lytic lesion is central and metaphyseal in location, abuts the adjacent growth plate, is minimally expansile, is well circumscribed (narrow zone of transition) and is without associated periosteal reaction.
