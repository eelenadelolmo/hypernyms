Texto: 
Mild soft tissue prominence at base of neck. No acute distress.
Surgical, supportive care
MRI (fetal): Lobulated, septated cystic structure extending
from the lower neck into the posterior mediastinum, measuring over 3.4 cm in length x 1.6 cm in AP diameter. There is no solid component within this cystic mass. The cystic structure is to the left of the trachea, displacing the trachea rightward. No tracheal or esophageal dilatation proximally or distally. The trachea extends 1 cm below the cystic mass and bifurcates normally at the carina. The lung parenchyma is homogeneous and appears symmetric in size. No lung masses or effusions. The cyst is posterior to the thymus and the great vessels. There is no edema nor ascites. Situs is normal.

CT (post-natal): Cyst in the middle mediastinum deviating
the esophagus and trachea to the right and anteriorly. Size relatively stable since prenatal exam.
As above, the differential diagnosis is:
Esophageal duplication, bronchogenic cyst, or lymphangioma.
Esophageal duplication
Bronchogenic cyst
Lymphangioma. 

No evidence of solid component to suggest teratoma. 
Mass appears separate from the thymus and thyroid.
Prenatal MRI of male fetus demonstrated a cystic mass at the thoracic inlet.
If the airway had been obstructed, the patient could have been intubated prior to complete delivery.
