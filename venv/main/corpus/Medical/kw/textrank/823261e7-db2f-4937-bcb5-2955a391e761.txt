Therefore, abdomen/pelvis CT performed with oral contrast only.
Patient was admitted and start on long-term anticoagulation.
CT image of the pelvis, with oral contrast material administration only, demonstrates asymmetric enlargement of the right common femoral vein with surrounding fat stranding, suspicious but not diagnostic of a deep vein thrombosis.

Abnormal compressibility and absence of color flow within the deep venous system of the right lower extremity extends from the right common femoral vein to the popliteal fossa.  Additionally, there is noncompressibility and absence of color flow within the greater saphenous vein.  Hypoechoic thrombus is evident within both deep and superficial venous systems.
Deep Venous Thrombosis (Acute)
Deep Venous Thrombosis (Acute)
Deep Venous Thrombosis (Chronic)
74 y/o woman with abdominal pain was evaluated by abdomen/pelvis CT from the ER.  Her abdominal pain was explained by hepatic flexure diverticulitis, however, incidental note was made regarding the vessels.
Incidental finding of right common femoral vein was possible in this particular non-contrast study due to the increased size of the vessel diameter (acute thrombosis). If the DVT were chronic, the vessel would have been normal or decreased in size and asymmetry would not have been apparent.
