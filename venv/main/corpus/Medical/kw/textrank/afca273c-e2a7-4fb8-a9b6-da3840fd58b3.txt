Fibrous dysplasia of the facial skeleton commonly involves the maxilla.  It commonly involves one maxilla.  The patient manifests with unilateral swelling of cheek (firm in consistency).  Patient may have unilateral proptosis because dysplasia involves the boundaries of the orbit reducing the space available for the orbital contents.  Some of these patients may suffer loss of vision due to entrapment of optic nerve in the dysplastic process.
