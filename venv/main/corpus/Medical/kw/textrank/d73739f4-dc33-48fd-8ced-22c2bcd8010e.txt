No treatment.  Followup for pregnancy complications or genitourinary concerns.
Multiple grayscale trans abdominal images of the pelvis demonstrate seperation of the endometrium and myometrium from of the upper 2/3rds of the uterus into seperate uterine horns joining at the lower uterine segment.  There is a single cervix.
BICORNUATE UTERUS
didelphys
septate uterus
arcuate uterus
Bicornuate uterus
Irregular appearance of cervix evaluate anatomy.
Uterine Malformations: incidence 0.5%
Classified into mechanism of malformation: 
1. Failure of fusion of the m?llerian ducts resulting in abnormal contour of the myometrium. Complete: didelphys with separate uterine horns, vagina and cervix
Partial: bicornuate as in this case with varying degrees of partial separation of the uterus and one vagina and arcuate uterus being the mildest end of the spectrum and considered more a normal variation then a malformation.

2. Failure of resorption of septum with normal external contour.  The septate uterus extends to the cervix.  Subseptate with septum ending prior to cervix. Increased risk of infertility and spontaneous abortions with septate uterus as septum composed of more fibrous elements then myometrium and has decreased blood supply. 

3. Arrested development of the m?llerian ducts with complete uterine aplasia to partial unicornis unicollis.

Hydrometrocolpos can be seen fusion abnormalities in which there is a rudimentary horn with no communication or in didelphys with obstruction by a septum.
Other complications include malpresentation and premature labor.

Associated congenital genitourinary anomalies: Ipsilateral renal agenesis on side of uterine horn agenesis, renal ectopia.
Mayer-Rokitansky- K?ster-Hauser: dysgenesis of mullerian ducts, vaginal and/or uterine agenesis, renal anomalies
