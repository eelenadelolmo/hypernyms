Texto: 
Patient resting comfortably, clear lung sounds.
Bilateral curvilinear shadows which follow the expected contour of the lungs.  However, note (small) pulmonary vessels lateral to the shadows, and that the shadows are bandlike, have sharp outer edge (with associated marginal transradiancy from Mach effect) and fade medially.
Skin folds mimicking bilateral pneumothoraces
Pneumothorax Mimics:
Skin fold, tubes, lines, clothing, hair, scapulae, bullae and walls of cavities may mimic pneumothorax
Fever Workup
This patient had no history of instrumentation/mechanical ventilation, and was resting comfortably.  On review of old studies, there were several variations of “pneumothorax mimic” due to skin folds.  A CT performed the following day for other reasons showed no evidence of pneumothorax.
