Left frontal lobe biopsy:   Spongioform encephalopathy consistent with Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease.
Brain MRI scans approximately 6 months apart show progressive diffuse cortical atrophy, T2/FLAIR and Diffusion increased signal within the Basal Ganglia.  Mild increased diffusion signal is seen in the posterior Thalamus (Pulvinar)
Correspoding relatively decreased ADC map basal ganglia signal.

MR Spectroscopy demonstrated a decrease in NAA peak.
Spongioform Encephalopathy, Presumed variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease
Cruetzfeldt-Jacob Disease
Variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease
Other transmissible spongioform encephalopathies
Diffuse ischemic insult

Less likely:
Methanol - putamen
Carbon Monoxide - globus pallidus 
Deposition of iron or copper
Neoplastic infiltrationâ€”particularly of lymphoma or glioma.
25 Y/O with new onset progrssive dementia, myclonus, EEG abnormalities, history of eating raw sheep's brain approximately 2 years ago.
