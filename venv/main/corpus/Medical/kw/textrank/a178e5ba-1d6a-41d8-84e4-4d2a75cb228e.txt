Texto: 
Calcium, ionized - low
Serum phosphorus - low
Serum alkaline phosphatase - elevated
TREATMENT: Administered gradually over several months or in a single day's dose with 15,000 mcg (600,000 U) of vitamin D. If the gradual method is chosen, 125-250 mcg (5000-10,000 U) is given daily for 2-3 months until healing is well established and the alkaline phosphatase concentration is approaching the reference range. Because this method requires daily treatment, success depends on compliance.
An alternative and recommended therapy is to administer the vitamin D in a single day, usually divided into 4 or 6 oral doses. An intramuscular injection also is available. Vitamin D is well stored in the body and released gradually over many weeks. Neither calcitriol nor calcidiol with their short half-lives are suitable. 
PREVENTION: 10 mcg (400U) PO daily vitamin D preparation and an adequate dietary supply of calcium and phosphorus prevent rickets. As little as 20 min/d of ultraviolet light to the face of a light-skinned baby is sufficient; however, significantly longer periods of exposure are necessary for children with melanotic skin.
BILATERAL WRISTS, KNEES: There is loss of the zone of provisional calcification in the metaphyses with slight irregularity and cupping of the metaphyses of
all the bones imaged. There is also apparent widening of the physes. Thin periosteal reaction along the radial aspect of the distal ulna, likely healing insufficiency fracture.
Rickets
Failure of osteoid calcification (rickets) (secondary to a disorder in the pathway of either vitamin D or phosphate metabolism):

1. Familial hypophosphatemia (formerly vitamin D–resistant rickets) 
2. Vitamin D–dependent rickets type I 
3. Receptor defect rickets (formerly vitamin D–dependent rickets type II) 
4. Defective 25-hydroxylase 
5. Fanconi syndrome (RTA with phosphate wasting)
6. Osteodystrophy (ie, renal rickets) and hypophosphatasia
Male infant with hypocalcemia. Breast-fed without oral supplementation.
Human milk contains little vitamin D, and, for babies weighing less than 1500 g, it also contains too little phosphate. Special supplementation (vitamin D, calcium, phosphate) is important if breast milk is primary dietary source.
