The patient received 6 cycles of chemotherhapy followed by an autologous stem-cell transplant. The patient expired 2 months following his transplant.
Systemic Anaplastic Large Cell (Ki-1) Lymphoma with Cutaneous Involvement (Case 2, 25th Annual Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, 2001; presented by Jeanne P. Osborne, MD, CPT, MC, USAF, and Bradley Graham, MD, LCDR, MC, USNR, Naval Medical Center, San Diego)
The patient was an active duty Marine stationed in Yuma, Arizona. He had a one day history of violaceous papules on his upper extremities and torso. He had a pertinent recent history for 4 weeks of non-productive cough, high fevers, chills, a 10 pound weight loss, and tender adenopathy in the neck and groin. One week prior to dermatologic evaluation, he had been diagnosed with pneumonia and treated with antibiotics without resolution. The patient was transferred to the Naval Medical Center, San Diego. Dermatology was consulted to rule out coccidioidomycosis due to the patient's lack of response to antibiotic therapy and his geographic location. A punch biopsy of a violaceous papule was performed.
Autopsy: Extensive infiltration of pleura, pericardium, spleen, liver, kidneys, bladder, prostate, and lymph nodes with large, atypical lymphocytes.
