Chem7 Normal
AST 23, ALT 20, Alk Phos 111, Tbilli 1.2
Patient underwent cholesystectomy, pathology pending.
There is normal hepatic flow, extraction and excretion.  Normal gallbladder filling and passage of radiotracer to small bowel.  Gallbladder filling verified on lateral view.  Post-CCK demonstrates poor GB ejection fraction (19.8%, Normal >35%).
Chronic cholecystitis
Biliary Dyskinesia
-Chronic Cholecystitis (most likely given hx of cholelithiasis and leukocytosis)
24yo female with PMHx of Chron's, s/p TI resection 10 yrs prior. Asymptomatic until 8 mo ago; now with intermittent postprandial abdominal pain and occasional nausea/emesis. Past CT exam revealed large (1.2cm) gallstone and narrowing of the distal ileum and distal colon c/w hx of Chron's.
In this patient with Chron's disease, abdominal pain is not unexpected.  After a long period of remission, however, and the classic symptoms of postprandial pain and cholelithiasis, a gallbladder etiology was explored, and confirmed with this hepatobiliary study.  Based on the initial scintigraphy, the findings were normal, only with the the addition of CCK and calculation of gallbladder ejection fraction was the etiology made clear.  This case demonstrates the need for a accurate patient history (in this case chronicity, rather than acuity of symptoms) which prompted a more detailed examination.
