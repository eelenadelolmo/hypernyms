The patient is a 2 year, 2 month old African American male who presents with gait disturbance, irritability and fever. Incidentally, the patient’s 4 year old sister presents concurrently with similar complaints. The patient has no significant medical or surgical history prior to this presentation.  Allergy to morphine: rash.  No history of known definite exposure to toxins.
Incidentally this patient’s sister presented at the same time with irritability and fever.  The sibling was found to have a  glioma within the left basal ganglia that was surgically resected.  The pathology returned as pilocytic astrocytoma.  While no connection between neoplasm and Krabbe was found through data/literature review, a link cannot be completely excluded.
