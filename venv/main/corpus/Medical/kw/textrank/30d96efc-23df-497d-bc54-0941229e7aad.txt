Conservative.
Right Kidney:
Multicystic mass replaces the right kidney, composed of multiple irregularly sized non-communicating cysts interposed between fibrous tissue. No clear renal collecting system.

Left Kidney:
Moderate pelviectasis with normal appearing renal parenchyma. No real time evidence of ureteral dilatation.
Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney (Right)
(Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (Left))
Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney
Autosomal Dominant Polycistic Kidney Disease
Ureteropelvic junction obstruction
Newborn baby boy with history of enlarged left renal pelvis and poor visualization of the right kidney on pre-natal ultrasound.
Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is the second most common cause of abdominal mass in the neonate and is felt to arise from ureteral occlusion between 8-10 weeks gestational age. Approximately 40% of unilateral MCDK will have a contralateral renal anomaly such as UPJ obstruction (as in this case), hypoplasia, etc. Providing the contralateral kidney is functional, MCDK may be an incidental finding in adulthood. Typically in time the MCDK shrinks and calcifies and the contralateral kidney often demonstrates compensatory hypertrophy. 

The findings described above on ultrasound are classic for MCDK. On angiography, there should be no renal artery on the affected side. 

MCDK is usually treated conservatively with periodic imaging to follow involution. Occasionally the MCDK may increase in size or other complications may warrant surgical removal.
