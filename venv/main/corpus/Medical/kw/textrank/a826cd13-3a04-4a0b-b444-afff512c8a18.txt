As discussed above, she has had several exacerbations of her back pain over the years, treated with conservative measures.  After this latest incident, she has been treated with chiropractic adjustments.  At a time following this evaluation a long axis distraction treatment to the lumbar spine was utilized resulting resolution of the acute nature of her symptoms.  She has been using heat and ice packs at home, as well as taking ibuprofen as needed.  She will continue to follow up with the chiropractor and her symptoms will be monitored.  Given the amount of instability on her flexion-extension radiographs, she may benefit from spinal fusion surgery if her symptoms persist or worsen.

67-year-old woman presenting with low back pain radiating down the left leg.  Several days prior to her visit, she tripped and fell down 3 stairs at home after stumbling on carpet and "jerking her body."  She reports symptom onset immediately after the incident.  Her pain is worse with movement and abates somewhat with rest.  She rates her pain at 4/10 sitting, 6/10 standing, and 6/10 when walking. The pain especially aggravates her at night when she is trying to fall asleep, it does not wake her from sleep.  She endorses intermittent tingling in the foot, denies any loss of coordination in the limb.  She denies any bowel of bladder dysfunction.  She denies any symptoms in the right leg.  She has been taking ibuprofen with some relief of her symptoms.  She applies heat packs in the morning, and ice packs at night with minimal relief.  

She had a work injury which resulted in similar symptoms, which somewhat resolve with activity modification and chiropractic treatment.  Other treatments included electrostimulation, use of a TENS unit, and was previously on narcotic pain medications.  Until this most recent exacerbation, she had not been treated in the chiropractic clinic for about 5 years.  She was able to continue working as a developmental aide for some time until retiring four years later. 

Past Medical History: 
This patient is otherwise healthy and takes no medications on a daily basis, she does take a multivitamin.  Surgical history includes bilateral knee replacements about a year apart.  She is currently retired and lives at home independently.  She is a non-smoker.  She has no known drug allergies.

Like many patients with back pain, her initial picture is relatively nonspecific on the surface.  She does not have any red flag symptoms for cauda equina syndrome or epidural abscess, so the rest of her history, physical testing and imaging are directed at teasing out a specific cause for her pain.  One would expect, given her left sided S1 radiculopathy confirmed by her electromyography, she would have more impressive imaging findings on that side.  However, her MRI images show a significant amount of overall degeneration, with some nerve root compression on both sides at different vertebral levels from disc bulging, as well as some overall canal stenosis.  Interestingly, she does not have significant foraminal stenosis of the left nerve roots at the L5 or S1 levels, though she does have spinal and lateral recess stenosis at the L4 level.  The instability present at this level resulting from disc degeneration and spondylolisthesis is felt to have resulted in the S1 radiculopathy perceived on electrodiagnostic testing.  

The flexion-extension radiographs add more to her story and help us to confirm a diagnosis.  She has a 10mm anterolisthesis at L4-L5 on flexion, which corrects somewhat to 5.1 on extension imaging.  This means there is an overall 4.9mm translational effect at that level when she moves from a flexion to extension position.  This amount of translational effect meets the criteria for the diagnosis of anatomic lumbar instability, also known as radiographic or structural lumbar instability.  The criteria for diagnosis are as follows: Posner proposed a minimum of 2.3mm or 8% of the vertebral body in L1-L4, and 1.6 or 6% of the vertebral body for L5 (10).  Earlier studies suggested sagittal plane translation of >4.5mm or 15% of the vertebral body width or rotation of a vertebral body of 15° at L1-L2, L2-L3, and L3-L4; 20° at L4-L5; or 25° at L5-S1. Positive findings on resting lateral radiograph are the same >4.5mm or 15% displacement in the sagittal plane or a relative sagittal plane angulation of >22° (6).  

Lumbar instability is generally defined as a significant decrease in the capacity of the stabilizing system of the spine to maintain the intervertebral neutral zones within the physiologic limits so that there is no neurologic dysfunction, no major deformity, and no incapacitating pain” (8).  Essentially, instability results in a failure of one of the three stabilization subsystems of the spine: passive, active, and neuromuscular (2, 6).  The passive subsystem is the bones, disc, and ligaments of the spine; the active subsystem in the muscles and tendons that attach to the spine and those working to stabilize the trunk, and the neuromuscular system is the central and peripheral nervous systems, using proprioceptive data and load sensation to coordinate the musculature and keep the spine stable.

Lumbar instability comes in two flavors, anatomic as described above, and functional, where patients have similar symptoms but do not meet the criteria for anatomic instability by flexion-extension imaging (2).  When a patient does not meet the radiographic criteria, there are several clinical tests that can be utilized to make the diagnosis.  These tests are somewhat controversial, as they have varying sensitivities and specificities (1, 3, 4) and are difficult to validate if the patient does not meet radiologic criteria for diagnosis.   However, all of these tests whether passive or active incorporate lumbar extension and associated pain.  As such, should the patient experience pain on extension range of motion of the lumbar spine, they are likely experiencing functional instability/somatic dysfunction and where anatomic instability could be assessed based on an aggregate of understanding of the clinical condition.  Lumbar bracing for the functional or anatomic unstable motor unit has been demonstrated clinically in the experience of contributors to relieve the pain and discomfort of the patient.  Additionally, strengthening of the lumbar paraspinal musculature is desired through exercise to aid stability to the lumbar spine (11). 

Our patient has several risk factors for lumbar instability, including the degenerative changes seen on her MRI including spondylolisthesis, disc degeneration, facet arthropathy (5), being of the female gender, obesity, working in an occupation that requires lifting, as well as a history of traumatic injury given the recent fall.  While she did not previously carry the diagnosis of instability, it is possible it had a hand in her previous back injuries, and many patients with instability have a history of recurrent back pain.  They often report the sensation of their back “slipping out” with motion or catching when the stand from flexion of the spine. Their pain is often worse with certain motions, as our patient complains that the pain with lying in bed and rolling over interferes with her sleep.

Treatment measures for instability center around conservative measures at first.  She has had treatment from a chiropractor, is taking ibuprofen as needed, and uses ice or heat packs to control symptoms at home.  The chiropractic care has ameliorated her symptoms, where she need only return on an as needed basis.  Other options for her include lumbar stabilization exercises, a program whereby the patient is trained to increase the strength of the stabilizing muscles and to improve motor control as well as proprioception.  This training program has been shown to improve symptoms from lumbar instability, as the increased muscle strength and proprioception balance out some of the structural instability (2).  As a last resort, spinal fusion surgery is often utilized in cases of anatomic instability, especially in patients with her level of anterolisthesis.  Many patients report improved symptoms after spinal surgery, though there is conflicting data on whether surgical patients do better than patients who use strictly conservative measures (9).

Overall, lumbar instability, especially functional instability, is an evolving area of medicine, and there is a need for further studies to improve diagnostic measures and to achieve some consensus on clinical testing.
