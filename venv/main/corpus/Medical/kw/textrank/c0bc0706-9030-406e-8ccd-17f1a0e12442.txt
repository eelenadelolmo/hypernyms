Gynecomastia
51 year old male referred to the breast care center for 5 week history of painful enlargement of the right breast.  Symptoms began after taking over the counter steroids containing dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) for about 1 year.  Enlargement of the breast had stabilized after stopping the steroids.
This patient is pending follow-up in the breast care center in several months.

"Regardless of the etiology of gynecomastia, the prognosis is excellent. Studies have shown that 90% of physiological gynecomastia involutes spontaneously within 2 years. In pathological-induced gynecomastia, medical or surgical treatment of the cause regresses gynecomastia, in most cases. In drug-induced gynecomastia, withdrawal of the medication leads to regression in 60% of patients. If the gynecomastia is of long duration, it is unlikely to spontaneously regress."
