Texto: 
Physical exam shows diffuse mild tenderness of bilateral lobes of thyroid. Normal size. No nodules.

TSH 0.02 uIU/ml (normal 0.51-4.9)
Free T4 67.3 pmol/L (normal 10.3 - 30.6)
Planar images from Tc-99m pertechnetate scan show faint patchy uptake in bilateral lobes of the thyroid.  24 hour I-131 uptake was 0.8% (normal 8-30%)
presumed surgical-induced thyroiditis
Diffusely decresed radiotracer uptake:
Thyroiditis (multiple causes)
Medications 
Thyroid ablation 
Surgical induced thyroiditis
New onset hyperthyroid symtoms (tachycardia, palpitations, heat intolerance, tremor) following anterior cervical fusion one month prior.
Low radioiodine uptake states all show decreased or absent uptake in the thyroid gland, and are typically due to one of the below etiologies:

Thyroiditis (painful from subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, deQuervain’s thyroiditis; painless from subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis; late Hashimoto’s disease)

Medications (thyroid replacement treatment, iodine from contrast, vitamins, Lugol’s solution, PTU, methamizole)

Thyroid ablation (surgery, I-131)

Surgery induced thyroiditis.  Neck surgery has been shown to be associated with development of postoperative thyroiditis. Surgery-induced thyroiditis can manifest in a mild form as serum hyperthyroxinemia or in a more severe form as clinical hyperthyroidism.  It is thought to result from vigorous manipulation of the thyroid during surgery, which can cause an acute thyroiditis.
