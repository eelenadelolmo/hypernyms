Prognosis is poor with average survival of 8-10 years. The mainstay of treatment is antiandrogen therapy most commonly oophorectomy. Patients with severe disease eventually require lung transplantation.

47 y/o non-smoking female with progressive dyspnea and cough for three years.
In a patient with cystic lung lesions on CT one must differentiate LAM from PLCH. In LAM the cysts are thin walled and diffusly seen throughout all lung fields. In PLCH which is caused by peribronchioler proliferation of langehrhan (dendritic macrophages) cells both thin and thick walled cysts are observed and the disease is seen primarly in the upper and middle lobes.
