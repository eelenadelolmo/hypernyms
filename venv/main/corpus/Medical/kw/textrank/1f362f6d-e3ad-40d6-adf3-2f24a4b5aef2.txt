5 y/o former 24 wk prematue infant with 5 mo NICU with multiple medical problems including history of IVH, CP, MR, congenital cardiac defects including PDA and ASD, and 47 XXY.  Patient's twin was stillborn. Patient presents with recent history of siezures and a progressively oddly shaped head.
This patient has multiple medical and genetic problems, but his cranial deformity is likely an isolated abnormality perhaps from prematurity and/or function of being a twin.  Craniosynostosis is not noted in the literature as being associated with XXY genotypes.
