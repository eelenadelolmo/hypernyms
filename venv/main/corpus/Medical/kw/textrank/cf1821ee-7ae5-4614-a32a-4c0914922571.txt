54 year old woman with a one month history of bronchitis not responding to treatment.
This patient had no signs of infection, so the opacity (air space) was investigated with  bronchoscopy and biopsy.  This case was originally diagnosed as BAC (Bronchoalveolar Carcinoma) - the the WHO 2004 changed this terminology to Adenocarcinoma in situ or AIS.  See Topic for additional information.
