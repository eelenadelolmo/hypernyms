Chronic bilateral knee pain.  No other joint complaints or significant medical problems.  No recalled history of trauma.
As the patient complained of isolated knee pain without lab values to support crystalline arthropathy or metabolic disorder, this chondrocalcinosis is less likely to be secondary to a systemic metabolic disorder.  No other joints are affected, and there are no significant degenerative changes of the knees noted on plain films.  In light of normal labs, this chondrocalcinosis is likely a senescent change.
