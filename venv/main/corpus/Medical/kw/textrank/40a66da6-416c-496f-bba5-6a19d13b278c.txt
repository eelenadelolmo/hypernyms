This patient underwent uncomplicated laparoscopic appendectomy.
Real time gray scale sonographic imaging of the right lower quadrant of the abdomen at the site of maximum tenderness using a graded compression technique demonstrates a distended noncompressible blind-ending tubular structure, which measures approximately 7 mm in diameter, measured outer wall to outer wall.  There are bright echogenic lines along the walls of the structure consistent with mucosal interfaces and two questionably intraluminal shadowing echogenic foci suggesting the possibility of internal stones or possibly inflamed echogenic fat.  There is no evidence of wall discontinuity or adjacent fluid collection.

Six-year-old female with right lower quadrant abdominal pain.
Pertinent results discussed in the pathology report are as follows:

GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is submitted in formalin labeled "appendix".  Submitted is a single portion of tubular pink tan tissue that measures 5 x 1 x 0.8 cm in three dimensions and appears slightly dilated in the tip portion of the grossly apparent appendix.  The tip section reveals a fecal/purulent internal content with no apparent appendicolith/fecalith.  The proximal aspect of the appendix is grossly unremarkable.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS: ACUTE SUPPURATIVE APPENDICITIS WITH SEROSAL ADHESIONS.
