Due to rupture of the syndesmosis and deltoid ligament, the mortice is unstable.  Plate and screw fixation of the fibula and syndesmotic screws are frequently needed.
- widening of medial clear space (>4mm) indicating deltoid ligament rupture
- widening of syndesmosis(>5mm) indicating rupture
- comminuted oblique fracture of fibula above the syndesmosis.
- fracture through the posterior malleolus
