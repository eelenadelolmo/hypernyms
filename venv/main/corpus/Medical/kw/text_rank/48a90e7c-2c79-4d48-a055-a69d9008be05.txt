Vitals signs within normal limits and are stable.

Neuro Exam
MS: Oriented to person, place and time. Attention not intact by MOYB>20 seconds, MOYF =12 secs. Pt was able to count number of people in the room correctly. Pt able to follow only 2 step commands. Pt able to register 3/3 words, diminished recall of items 20 mins after asked demonstrated 1/3 words correct. Language is fluent however phrase length diminished. Repetition and naming intact. No right left confusion. Pt does demonstrate some item substitution with ideomotor praxis testing with some evidence of praxis impairment during exam. No evidence of neglect

CN: 
II: VA 20/30, VFFTC, pupils symmetric with sluggish reactivity
III,IV,VI: Full versions, patient has diplopia with right gaze with apparent nystagmus movements bl on right gaze. Pt&#39;s pursuits are saccadic. Pt&#39;s saccades demonstrate considerable overshoot specifically when looking from right to left. Absent upgaze however able to look up with oculogyric testing. OKN is absent in all directions. No ptosis present. Noted esotropia on right gaze.
VOR performed and demonstrated numerous catch-up saccades in right and left directions.
V: V1-3 grossly intact, MOM intact, prominent jaw titubation with mouth mildly open
VII: Decreased expression of facies at rest however symmetrical smile with myoclonic movement of jaw and lip
VIII: Grossly intact to conversation
IX,X: demonstrates profound hypophonia while speaking
XI: Intact bilaterally
XII: Demonstrates lingual titubation however grossly intact.

Motor: Increased tone in upper extremities, with moderately increased tone in the lower extremities. No pronator drift. Noted postural myoclonic/titubation movements of the distal extremities R>L with appendicular movement hesitation BL. Noted for truncal titubation while sitting up. Pt strength in upper and lower extremities.

Reflexes: Pt is hyper-reflexic and brisk 3/4 throughout with equivocal to down going toes to Babinski

Coordination: Pt FTN and heel to shin demonstrate bl dysmetria. RAM in upper and lower extremities are slow but do not demonstrate a decremental response. 

Sensory: FT and temperature intact bilaterally. Proprioception intact distally and vibarotyr intact. Romberg is normal. Graphesthesia intact

Gait: Pt with significant difficulty standing up form seated position with evidence of truncal titubation/myoclonus. Narrow base stance with positive pull test demonstrating retropulsion. Evidence of axial instability during gait.
Patient has been transferred to palliative care.

This disease is uniformly fatal; death often occurs within a year of symptom onset.
Abnormal increased signal intensity of putamen and caudate on T2 FLAIR
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)
Clinical Differential:
Alzheimers dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson’s dementia, metabolic disorders (Hashimoto’s encephalitis, hepatic encephalopathy), infectious encephalitis, HIV, malignancy, toxic encephalopathy, cerebral degeneration secondary to chronic toxin ingestion, psychiatric disease, cerebrovascular disease, autoimmune disorders
59 y.o. woman three months ago acute onset of neurologic symptoms.  She has developed generalized hypokinesia, masked facies, tremors, and dysmetria.  Additionally, her short term memory function has become severely compromised.  She also reports rapidly progressive ataxia, speech abnormalities, diplopia.

She has lived in Germany for 20 years as enlisted spouse.  No prior history of neurologic disease or early dementia in her family.  She has three adult children who are all healthy and living in the states.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease the most common form of prion disease in humans.  A prion is a small molecule that causes certain proteins to become irregularly folded.  Irregularly folded proteins  accumulate forming plaques, result in apoptosis of neurons and ultimately severe neurologic degeneration.   Four other human prion diseases, kuru, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, and fatal familial insomnia are recognized.  Incubation periods for prion diseases are long; however, once symptoms begin, deterioration is rapid and all cases result in death.  

Classically Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) presents with rapidly progressive mental deterioration and myoclonus.  Neurologic deterioration may manifest as dementia, strange behavioral changes, or impairment of higher functioning including memory, concentration and/or judgment.   Sleep disturbances, including hypersomnia and insomnia are also common.  Generally, dementia becomes dominant as the disease progresses.   Hypokinesia and cerebellar manifestations are common extrampyramidal signs.  Hyperreflexia, extensor plantor response, or spasticity may indicate involvement of the corticospinal tract.

Magnetic resonance imaging is the most useful in establishing a diagnosis.  T2 and proton density axial images with 3 mm slice thickness, FLAIR axial and sagittal images at 3 mm slice thickness, T1 images, and diffusion weight images are the recommended protocols for patients with suspected CJD.   Increased T2 and FLAIR intensity in the putamen are the most common finding on conventional MRI sequences.  Hyperintensity in the globus pallidus, thalamus, cerebral and cerebellar cortex, or white matter are less common.  Diffusion weighted imaging is the most sensitive technique followed by proton density imaging.
