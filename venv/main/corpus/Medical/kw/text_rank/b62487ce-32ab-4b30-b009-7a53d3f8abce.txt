A 15 year old girl presents with pain in the left hip for the last 4 – 5 days.  She has a history of SCFE on the right hip which had been repaired 3 years ago.  She says the pain is not the same as the SCFE, and that her left hip is “just hanging there.”  It does not hurt when there is no weight bearing on it.
