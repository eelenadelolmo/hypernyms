Palpable mass in the medial elbow.
Treatment is usually surgical excision.
Radiographic examination demonstrates a rounded soft tissue mass in the medial aspect of the elbow.
MRI findings include a T2 hyperintense fusiform tumor.  On T1 weighted imaging, the mass is homogenous and isointense to muscle.  The tumor strongly enhances follwing Gadolinium administration.  Note that this infiltrating mass is contiguous with the nerve.
Neurofibroma
Neurofibroma vs Schwannoma (neurilemmoma). 
Cat scratch disease may have similar plain film findings.
52 year-old-male presents with medial elbow pain.
While neurofibromas are a hallmark of NF Type I, only 10% of patient's with neurofibromas actually have Von Recklinghausen's disease.  To meet diagnostic criteria for NF I, a patient must exhibit two of the following:
6 or more caf?-au-lait macules (>5mm-prepuberty or >15mm-postpuberty), 2 or more neurofibromas of any type or 1 plexiform neurofibroma, freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions, optic glioma, 2 or more Lisch nodules, distinctive bony lesion (i.e. sphenoid dysplasia, thinning of long bone cortex with or without pseudoarthrosis), a first degree relative diagnosed with NF1. 
While malignant transformation is rare, this would present with indistinct margins, a sudden incrase in size and internal areas of hemorrhage and necrosis.
Lesions usually affect young adults 20-30 years without sex predilection.
Unlike schwannomas, neurofibromas are intimately intermixed and are inseparable from the normal nerve tissue.
