This 42 y/o active duty man jumped from his vehicle and felt a pop.  He then tried to hop on the other leg to the aid station and felt a pop in the good leg.  The rest is history with him lying in the dirt unable to walk, asking for help, crawling on his belly, etc.
This unusual case may represent how the "fog of war" may increase incidence of otherwise systemic based injuries.
