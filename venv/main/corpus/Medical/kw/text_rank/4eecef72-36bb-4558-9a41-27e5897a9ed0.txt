Venous catheters may demonstrate unusual venous drainage (eg. left-sided SVC).  Knowledge of venous drainage anomalies is important for an ICU physician when reviewing the line placement.  PAPVR is in the spectrum of left-to-right shunts (with ASD, VSD, and PDA), but occurs at the level of the pulmonary veins.   When left-to-right shunts are large, patients can present with with shortness of breath and pulmonary hypertension.
