Treatment: Reimplantation of the hypoplastic right pulmonary artery to the main pulmonary artery and PDA ligation

Follow up: Within one month following surgery the right atrial pressure dropped to one half systolic pressure, suggesting the operation was successful at restoring normal blood flow.  As of 02/22/2013 patient is doing well.  He is 50th percentile for height and weight.  He has no signs of cyanosis or peripheral edema.  His EKG shows normal sinus rhythm, with evidence of right ventricular conduction delay but no gross T wave abnormalities.  Echocardiography shows no dilation or hypertrophy of any heart chambers.  His right pulmonary artery is still smaller than the left, however it appears to be growing well.
The ascending aorta gives off the right pulmonary artery.  A small VSD cannot be excluded.  The left pulmonary artery is connected to the descending aorta by a prominent PDA.  The trachea and esophagus are unremarkable.  The lungs demonstrate no evidence of parenchymal consolidation, pleural effusions, or hilar adenopathy.  The patient is normal situs.

1 day old male born by spontaneous vaginal delivery with Apgars of 9 and 9 was discovered to be lethargic with decreased PO intake.  Patient was transferred to Dayton Children’s from an outside facility.  maintenence IV fluids were started and patient was placed on hyperalimentation and lipids at 100cc/kg/day and 2 mg/kg/day protein.  Patient remained stable for further workup.
Anomalous origin of one pulmonary artery from the ascending aorta, or hemitruncus arteriosus, is a rare congenital defect.  Three characteristic features are present in this diagnosis: a missing pulmonary artery from the pulmonary trunk, a vessel arising from the ascending aorta and entering the hilus of a single lung, and the involved lung having normal size and structure.  Most often, the anomalous side involves the right pulmonary artery, as the defect typically occurs opposite the aortic arch.  In a 1974 study by Keane et al., 44/50 hemitruncus arteriosus patients had right-sided anomalous pulmonary arteries.  It is believed that hemitruncus arteriosus is the result of improper truncal septation during fetal cardiac development.  In a normal heart, two ridges form in the primitive truncus that extend from the cephalic area of the developing heart down to the base of the conus where they meet to form a truncoconal septum.  The ridges rotate and fuse.  This process divides the aorta and pulmonary trunk from the primitive truncus.  If the right truncoconal ridge originates too far dorsally, then the proximal 6th aortic arch, and subsequently the right pulmonary artery, will arise from the ascending aorta.  

The effects of hemitruncus arteriosus on the cardiopulmonary system are extensive.  First, the affected lung receives blood at systemic pressure, which is substantially greater than typical pulmonary pressures.  Next, because the pulmonary trunk fails to divide, the unaffected side receives the entire cardiac output, causing similarly elevated pressures.  Moreover, a patent ductus arteriosus frequently coexists, exacerbating the elevated pulmonary volume and pressure.  Essentially, the hemitruncus arteriosus causes a massive left-to-right shunt.  Clinically, this presents in the first three months of life as pulmonary hypertension, poor weight gain, respiratory distress and ultimately congestive heart failure.  A mild cyanosis may be present, but this is due to pulmonary disease rather than right to left shunting.  Physical exam features include wide pulse pressure, snappy peripheral pulses, prominent S1/S2, and a systolic murmur best heard along the left sternal border.  If left untreated, the prognosis for this condition is poor.  Infants typically do not survive beyond the first year of life.  However, if diagnosed and corrected before microscopic evidence of pulmonary vascular disease occurs the prognosis becomes much more favorable.    

Due to the severe nature of this condition, early diagnosis is imperative.  Many imaging findings aid in making the diagnosis.  First, echocardiography will show dilation of the left atrium and ventricle resulting from excess blood volume making its way through the pulmonary vasculature.  Right ventricular hypertrophy may also be present due to the pulmonary hypertension.  Finally, the echo will fail to show a normal bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk.  Computed tomography scan with three-dimensional reconstruction is often used for diagnosis as well.  Three-dimensional viewing allows the radiologist to see directly where the anomalous vessel arises.  Chest radiographs may also be helpful in making the diagnosis.  Radiographs will show an enlarged cardiac silhouette for the same reasons described above.  Additionally, the affected lung will have increased vascular markings.  Cardiac catheterization is another means of diagnosing this condition.  The catheter will not be able to pass into both pulmonary arteries, providing a clue to hemitruncus arteriosus as the etiology.  Lastly, angiography can be utilized to establish the diagnosis.

When evaluating a neonate with lethargy it is important to always consider a cardiac malformation.  Superficially speaking, congenital heart defects fall under three categories: right-to-left shunts, left-to-right shunts and obstructive malformations.  Right-to-left shunts result in hypoxemia and cyanosis, as deoxygenated blood is able to bypass the lungs and reach systemic circulation.  These often present early in life and may require immediate intervention.  Right-to-left shunts include: Tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great vessels, truncus arteriosus, tricuspid atresia and total anomalous pulmonary venous return.  Left-to-right shunts typically present later in life as cyanosis development due to Eisenmenger’s Syndrome whereby pulmonary pressure exceeds systemic pressure and shunt reversal occurs.  These include atrialseptal defects, ventriculoseptal defects and persistent ductus arteriosus.  Finally, obstructive lesions present in a variety of ways and include coarctation of the aorta, aortic valve stenosis and pulmonic valve stenosis.  Although the aforementioned lesions compromise the overwhelming majority of congenital heart defects, it is important to maintain an open mind when working up a potential cardiac defect as the heart can become malformed in an infinite number of ways.  Anomalous origin of a pulmonary artery from the ascending aorta is one such way.  Accurate diagnosis of congenital heart defects can be made when an interprofessional team of physicians and healthcare providers analyzes history, physical exam findings and imaging studies.  With proper diagnosis and management of congenital heart defects, as in the case presented above, a tragedy can be averted and a life saved.
