Neoplasm Name: Medulloblastoma 

Synonyms: PNET (primitive neuroectodermal tumor), Central neuroblastoma 

Cell of Origin: 
Cell of origin is not clear. Several choices have been offered: 
1) 'medulloblasts' 
2) external granular cells 
3) subependymal matrix cells 
4) more than one cell of origin 

WHO Grade(s): WHO 4 

Genetics and Associations: 

Demographics (Age, Sex, Incidence): 
Peak age is 7, 70% <16 (30%>15), most adults <40 
65% Male (~2:1 M:F) 
Incidence - 0.5/100k in CHILDREN (<15 yo) 

Common Locations: 
Posterior fossa, usually midline 

Gross Appearance: 
Varies from soft to firm, some are well defined, may be hemorrhagic 

Radiology: 
Relatively homogeneous, may be uniformly hyperdense on non-contrast CT. MR signal similar to gray-matter, most not bright on T2W MR 

Histology: 
Densely cellular, hyperchromatic "carrot-shaped" nuclei, high nuclear to cytoplasm ratio, neuroblastic rosettes 

Special Stains: 

Prognosis and Treatment: 
Survival up to 85% at five years with combined radiation and chemotherapy [Magnani C, Pastore G: Survival of childhood cancer patients in Italy,1978-1989. ITACARE Working Group.Tumori 1997 Jan-Feb;83(1):426-89. 
Up to 100% in pts. w/o CSF spread (Bourne 1992 J Neurooncol)
