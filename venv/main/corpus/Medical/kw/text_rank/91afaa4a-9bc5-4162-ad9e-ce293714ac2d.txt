Pancreatic islet cell tumor is typically seen as a solid hypervascular pancreatic mass, typically located in the pancreatic head.  These masses may be large at the time of diagnosis (over 4cm) and have cystic changes and necrosis.

Islet cell tumor subtypes include insulinoma (most common type), gastrinoma (associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), and non-functioning.

Islet cell tumors are typically sporadic but can be seen in multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes, MEN 1 in particular, and von Hippel Lindau Syndrome.  

Malignant transformation occurs in up to 80% of patients with non-functioning islet cell tumor.  Nodular calcifications are seen in 20-25%, with contrast enhancement on CT in 83% of non-functioning islet cell tumor cases.
