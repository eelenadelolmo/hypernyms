•Indication for repair controversial: traditionally thought to have high rate of complication untreated with high mortality rate from emergent repair- being challenged now, more people being followed with conservative management

•Tenets of PEH repair: reduction of the stomach to an intra-abdominal location, achieving adequate intra-abdominal esophageal length, excision of the hernia sac, and sound closure of the esophageal hiatus.

•Acute: laparoscopic repair including reduction of the hernia content, excision of the sac, crural closure, and fundoplication (Dor or Nissen) is safe.
Multiple double contrast views of the upper gastrointestinal tract demonstrate a left intrathoracic gastric fundus  and infradiaphragmatic gastroesophageal junction.  No stricture or ulcer.
