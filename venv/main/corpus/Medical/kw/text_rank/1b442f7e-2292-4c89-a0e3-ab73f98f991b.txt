Treatment with surgical decompression is usually performed on patients with greater than 5mm midline shift or maximal thickness greater than 1cm.  Surgical treatment is also performed for comatose patients with hematomas less than 1cm or less than 5mm midline shift if the GCS decreases by 2 points, the pupils are fixed and dilated or intracranial pressure is greater than 20mm Hg.  Treatment is with craniotomy and evacuation of hematoma.
