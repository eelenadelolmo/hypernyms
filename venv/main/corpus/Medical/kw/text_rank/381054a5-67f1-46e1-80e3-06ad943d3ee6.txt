1.  There is normal biodistribution of the radiotracer within the vascular structures and soft tissues on the blood flow and blood pool images of the chest.  Focal uptake within the left forearm soft tissues confirms it as the injection site.  Normal uptake in the genitourinary system and soft tissues.
 
2.  There is abnormal, diffuse radiotracer uptake within the right lower scapular margin, as well as within the right third (3rd) lateral rib, the right anterior eigth (8th) rib and the proximal to mid right femur, extending toward the femoral head.  Dedicated spot images of these areas show similar findings.
