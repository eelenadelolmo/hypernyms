Pt is developmentally delayed. She is able to stand on her own, speak a few words and smile appropriately.
No specific treatment exists for SWS.  The patient can be given appropriate medications for seizures, however, even with medications, the seizures of SWS are difficult to manage.  The port-wine stain can be treated by photothermolysis for cosmetic purposes.  If the patient develops glaucoma medical management can be attempted prior to surgical treatment.
Frontal and lateral views of the skull were obtained as a component of a shunt evaluation.  These films show tram track intracranial calcifications over the posterior cerebral hemisphere. 

Non-contrast CT of brain demonstrated hydrocephalus, left sided intracranial calcifications of the cortex and atrophy of the left cerebral hemisphere, and hypertrophy of the overlying cranium.

MR of brain was obtained when the patient experienced stroke like symptoms.   These show lack of nomal left-sided venous drainage resulting in tortuous anomalous venous structures.

The leptomeningeal angioma of left side meninges is best seen on the TRICKS MR angiogram.
Sturge Weber Syndrome
1.  Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome:  triad of cutaneous capillary and venous malformations (usually port-wine stain), venous varicosities, and hyperplasia of soft tissues and bone

2.  Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome: may also have port-wine stain, but other features are macroglossia, omphalocele, macrosomia, and hypoglycemia

3.  Sturge-Weber Syndrome:  triad of cutaneous capillary and venous malformations (usually port-wine stain), ocular lesions (choroidal angioma and buphthalmos) and cerebral hemiatrophy.
This 8 yo girl presented at birth with large left sided facial nevus involving all three branches of the cutaneous trigeminal nerve.
Pt was diagnosed with Sturge Weber disease at birth; and, by the age of 3 months she had her first episode of seizures.  At age 4 months, CT showed developing atrophic change of the left cerebral hemisphere and hydrocephallus of the lateral ventricles bilaterally.  The patient had a VP shunt placed with good control. Pt also has a history of TIAs and a completed stroke.  

This patient is experiencing continued problems with ischemic syndromes, perhaps the MR TRICKS images will suggest a potential neurosurgical intevention.
