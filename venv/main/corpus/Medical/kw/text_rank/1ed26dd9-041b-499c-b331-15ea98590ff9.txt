Thin male in no acute distress.
VSS.
CHEST - Trace bibasilar crackles.
Otherwise unremarkable PE.

PERTINENT LABS:
1) Serum Calcium - 14 mg/dl. 
2) Hemoglobin - 11 gm/dl.
3) Hematocrit - 33%
4) ACE - 72 micrograms/liter.
5) Sputum, acid fast stain - negative.
6) Sputum, mycobacterial culture - negative.
Steroids are the drug of choice for the treatment of sarcoidosis. Treatment is indicated for significant pulmonary functional impairment, for ocular/myocardial/CNS disease. Most therapeutic regimens employ Prednisone with tapered dosages over an interval of 6 months or more until a response is observed.
1) CXR, PA/LAT - Bilateral hilar prominence, likely nodal. 
2) GALLIUM SCINTIGRAM WB PLANAR ANTERIOR & POSTERIOR VIEWS, 72 HRS - Abnormal, increased, nodular-appearing tracer uptake in the bilateral hila. The foci of uptake are equally intense, partially confluent, and of greater intensity than the sternum and vertebral column. Radiotracer concentration in the skeleton, liver, spleen, and GI tract appears physiologic. The salivary and lacrimal gland uptake appears physiologic. There is abnormal bilateral symmetric renal retention (>48 hours after Gallium dosing).
Sarcoidosis
1)  Sarcoidosis
2)  TB
3)  Coccidiomycosis
4)  Histoplasmosis
5)  Lymphoma
6)  Metastatic Disease
7)  EG (Langerhan Histiocytosis)
8)  Silicosis
9)  Berylliosis
10) HYPERSENSITIVITY PNEUMONITIS
58 year old male with a 2 month history of dry cough and dyspnea. Persistent hypercalcemia. Hilar adenopathy on CXR.
Regarding the Gallium scintigram in sarcoidosis - it reflects disease ACTIVITY.
1) 'Lambda sign' - bilateral symmetric hilar uptake with paratracheal uptake - is a characteristic pattern of uptake in active sarcoidosis. Though there is bilateral symmetric hilar uptake, there is no classic 'lambda sign'.
2) 'Panda sign' - nasopharyngeal uptake with bilateral symmetric parotid, salivary, and lacrimal gland uptake - is a characteristic pattern of uptake in active sarcoidosis. Though there is nasopharyngeal uptake, there is no classic 'panda sign'.
3)  In this case, there is no abnormal pulmonary parenchymal uptake. This is suggestive of Stage 1 disease or inactive Stage 2 disease. Stage 2 disease, by definition, involves the parenchyma.  
4)  Within the first 24 hours, the kidneys excrete > colon. By 48 hours, the colon excretes > kidneys.  In this case, at 72 hours, there is persistent renal Gallium accumulation suggestive of renal dysfunction.
