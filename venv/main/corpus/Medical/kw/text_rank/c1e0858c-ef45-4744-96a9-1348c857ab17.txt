Physical Exam: Blood pressure 122/64, pulse 84, respiratory rate 12, temperature 36.8, oxygen saturation 92% on room air.  Patient is an obese female in no acute distress.  Alert and oriented to person, time, and place.  Extraoccular movements intact.  Pupils equal and reactive to light. Moist mucous membranes with clear oropharynx.  Neck supple without thyromegaly.  Regular heart rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2 without appreciable murmur, rub or gallop. No JVD.  Diminished breath sounds bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Normal bowel sounds.  Soft nontender, nondistended.  1+ pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities. No clubbing or cyanosis.  Neuro exam grossly normal.
Labs: Sodium 139, potassium 4.8, chloride 101, bicarbonate 29, BUN 6, Creatinine 0.7, glucose 92, calcium 9.5. Hemoglobin 14.4, hematocrit 41.2, WBC 7.8, platelets 241,000.  EKG: NSR.
Treatment: Most patients are treated symptomatically.  Recurrent pneumothoraces are treated with pleural abrasion, pleurodesis, or pleurectomy.  Chylous effusion can be managed with thoracentesis, chemical pleurodesis, or partial pleurectomy. Antiestrogen measures have also been employed: surgical oophorectomy, ovarian irradiation, hormonal therapy (tamoxifen, gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonist, luteinizing hormone releasing hormone, and progesterone administration).  Lung transplantation may be performed in end-stage disease.
Follow-up: Lung function decline in LAM patients is measured with FEV-1.  Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is using to determine supplemental oxygen requirements and may provide helpful referral parameters for lung transplantation.
• CXR: Lungs clear.  Cardiomegaly.
• CT chest: Multiple bilateral and diffuse thin-walled cysts relatively homogeneous in size.

40 year old woman with history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP, and morbid obesity.  Multiple hospitalizations for shortness of breath.
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare interstitial lung disease that affects only women, typically during their reproductive years. A small percentage of patients, also usually women, have LAM in association with tuberous sclerosis. LAM is characterized by the abnormal proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the lungs and in the thoracic and retroperitoneal lymphatics. Affected patients are also at risk of developing renal hamartomas and angiomyolipomas. Patients with LAM characteristically present with chronic cough and dyspnea and less commonly with spontaneous pneumothorax. At radiography, LAM manifests with normal to increased lung volumes and interstitial reticular opacities that are often subtle. Unilateral pneumothorax and unilateral or bilateral chylous pleural effusions are frequent radiographic findings. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrates bilateral diffuse thin-walled cysts surrounded by normal lung parenchyma. CT may also demonstrate associated chylous pleural effusions or pneumothorax and thoracic or abdominal lymphadenopathy.
