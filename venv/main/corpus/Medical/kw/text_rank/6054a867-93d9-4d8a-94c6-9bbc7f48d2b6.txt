Healthy appearing male.
Referral to pediatric surgery for pyloroplasty or gastroenterostomy.
The upper GI exam demonstrates contrast material flowing through thickened mucosal interstices of the narrowed pyloric canal creating the double-track sign.  Failure of relaxation of the spincter between peristaltic waves is diagnostic.

Sonographically, the pyloric channel is enlongated greater than 14mm and the pyloric muscle wall is thickened by greater than 3.0 mm.  Transversly, a target sign can be seen with a hypoechoic ring of hypertrophied pyloric muscle surrounding the echogenic mucosa. 
With the administration of electrolyte solution during the exam, there is delayed gastric emyptying with poor or absent spincter relaxation, and exaggerated peristaltic waves.
Plyoric Stenosis
Peripyloric mass -annular pancreas or tumor.
Duplication cyst of pylorus.  
Gastroesophegeal reflux
Gastroenteritis
Congenital gastric outlet obstruction with pyloric web or atresia.
2 week old infant referred for upper GI examination and abdominal ultrasound because mother reports projectile vomiting after every feeding.
Early definative diagnosis before profound electrolyte inbalance and weight loss with high relolution ultrasound and single contrast upper GI series has significantly reduced mortality.

To evaluate for the possiblity of malrotation, the UGI should be complimented with a limited small bowel follow through to the level of the duodenal-jejunal junction.

Sonographically, the superior menesteric artery and vein positions should be documented as additional evidence for or against malrotation.  The SMA is anterior and to the left of the SMV in normal patients.

The child should present to the exam hungry and ready to feed.
