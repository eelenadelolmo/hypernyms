No neurologic abnormalities.  Focal 9/10 low back pain.
Surgical spinal fusion
Radiograph of L-spine:
Compression fracture involving the posterior aspect of L1 with posterior displacement of the fracture fragment--concern for burst fracture

CT:
L1 burst fracture
Known polycystic kidney disease incidentally imaged
Burst Fracture of L1
Compression vs. Burst fracture
Pt is a 58yo man presented with focal back pain.  One day prior to presentation he fell from a ladder at a height of 6ft and landed on his feet.
Important to note that this is a post-traumatic burst fracture rather than pathologic fracture.  

Burst fractures:
-Typically occurs in cervical or lumbar vertebrae after axial loading (falling and landing on feet)
-Mechanism: Nucleus pulposus of disk is forced into vertebral body, which, in turn, shatters
-Fracture must involve all 3 columns of vertebra
-All burst fx should be considered unstable since 42-58% of fx result in neurologic injury
-Spinal cord injury usually caused by retropulsion of fragment of posterior aspect of vertebral body
-These fractures are commonly associated with calcaneal fractures
