Pulmonary exam demonstrated decreased breath sounds bilaterally.  There were mild subcostal retractions.
The patient was treated with lobectomy for possible CCAM.  Symptoms resolved.  Pathology revealed pulmonary interstitial emphysema.
A chest radiograph demonstated hyperaeration of the left lung with peculiar streaky shadows criss-crossing the entire left lung field.  CT images of the lung demonstrated hyperinflation of the left lung, septal thickening and hyperlucencies.
Pulmonary Interstitial Emphysema (PIE)
CCAM
Congenital Lobar Emphysema
This patientis a premature infant born at 34 weeks gestation with apgar scores of 7 and 9.  The patient requried minimal respiratory assist with CPAP for 3 days without surfactant.  The patient was weaned from O2 by day 7.  Dyspnea was then noted on day 9 and imagings studies were performed.  The patient was taken to surgery for treatment.
This case in unusual in that the PIE occured almost a week after minimal positive pressure ventilation with CPAP.  It had a slightly atypical appearnce on CT but was confirmed by pathology.
