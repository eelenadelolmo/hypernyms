A 3cm diameter firm, immobile non-erythematous mass was noted at the right SCM just posterior to the angle of the mandible. The mass was nontender to palpation and no lymphadenopathy was noted. The child’s head was laterally flexed toward the side of the mass and the child’s chin was rotated toward the contralateral side.
Conservative treatment with passive neck exercises was recommended. It was also recommended that the parents frequently rotate the infants sleeping position. Surgical release and lengthening of the SCM would be considered if no improvement was seen by 1 year of age or if significant deformation of face developed. 

The infant was followed regularly and the mass subsequently decreased in size with complete resolution by 8 months of age. The child was demonstrating increased neck range of motion at 2 weeks follow up and after 6 weeks of passive neck exercises, the torticollis had resolved with no facial deformities.
CT shows a well circumscribed area of hyperattenuation within the right SCM posteriomedial to the mandible.

Ultrasound demonstrates a homogenous, minimally hyperechoic mass within the right SCM with well defined borders.

Fibromatosis Colli is a rare condition involving fibrous proliferation and replacement of the SCM muscle and an asymmetric deformity of the neck with lateral flexion toward the ipsilateral side and rotation of the chin to the contralateral side. 

Fibromatosis Colli is the most common cause of pediatric torticollis and it occurs in 0.4% of all infants. The growth is typically unilateral and the right and left side of the neck are equally involved. The incidence is equal in male and females. 

Etiology is thought to be related to birth trauma with breech and primiparous births as well as forceps assisted deliveries. Due to the maturity of the fibrous tissue found within the mass, some believe the condition may begin in utero.

Infants usually present around 2 to 4 weeks of age with a nontender, painless neck mass noticed by the parent. Most patients will have complete resolution of the mass by one year of age. 

Fibromatosis Colli is usually a clinical diagnosis with occasional use of ultrasound. In this case, the tumor was also demonstrated on CT; a modality rarely used to make this diagnosis. On review of the literature, there are few documented cases of this condition appearing on CT imaging.

Treatment consists of a series of passive neck exercises. Though less than 20% ultimately require surgical intervention, failure of resolution is an indication for surgery and left untreated can cause Plagiocephaly on the ipsilateral side.
