Normal coagulation profile.  One day post normal delivery.
Conservative therapy (because there is no significant mass effect).

NOTE: Athough there was no overt trauma - there certainly can be stress and strains during delivery, including Valsalva, etc.
Acute right extraaxial collection consistent with subdural hematoma
There is mild mass effect, but without midline herniation
Post-partum spontaneous non-traumatic subdural hematoma
• Epidural hematoma
• Subdural empyema
• Subdural hematoma
• Dural Lymphoma, Sarcoid, metastasis
• Dural fistula
22 year old woman, one day post partum.  
Developed right sided headache 12 hours after delivery.
No head trauma.
MRI and CTA and Angiogram all failed to determine a cause of the acute subdural hemorrhage. Most case reports of post-partum SDH have been associated with spinal anesthesia.
