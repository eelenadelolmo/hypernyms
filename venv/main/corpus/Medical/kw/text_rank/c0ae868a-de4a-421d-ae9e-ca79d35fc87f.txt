Fibrous dysplasia of the skull is characterized by a "ground glass" appearance in an expansile bone. Common sites of involvement include the ribs, proximal femurs (Shepherd’s crook deformity) and calvarium. Three distinct patterns are noted including cystic (most active – 25%), pagetoid – 50%, and sclerotic (least active -25%).  

There are three major presentations:
monostotic (most common), 
polyostotic, 
McCune-Albright syndrome.  

Malignant transformation is possible into osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytomas.
