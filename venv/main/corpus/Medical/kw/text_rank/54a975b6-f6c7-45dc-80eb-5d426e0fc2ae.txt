Physical examination reveals a young male with short stature, exaggerated deep tendon reflexes, abnormal proprioception,  and para-paresis
The patient is referred to a radiation oncologist for further treatment.
Sagittal and axial T1-weighted and T2-weighted images of the spine demonstrate multiple epidural soft tissue masses causing spinal cord compression as well as bulky paraspinal soft tissue masses located in the mid thoracic and sacral spine, findings consistent with extramedullary hematopoiesis, given the history of the patient. There is also diffuse hypointensity of the spinal bone marrow on both T1-weighted  and T2-weighted images, reflecting hematopoietic marrow hyperplasia as a response to the ineffective erythropoiesis of Cooley&#39;s anemia. The vertebral bodies have a striated appearance due to thickened reinforcement of  vertical trabeculae and resorption of horizontal trabeculae.

A 37-year old man with a history of beta thalassemia major presents with a two month histoty of back and lower extremity pain and abnormal gait.
Given the patient&#39;s history, the characteristic location and morphology of the spinal soft tissue masses and the morphologic abnormalities of the vertebrae and  ribs , extramedullary hematopoiesis is the most likely diagnosis. 

It should be noted that the diffuse T1 hypointensity of the spinal bone marrow is not similar to the diffuse T1 hypointensity noted in neoplastic bone marrow inflitration (e.g. metastatic disease). The signal intensity on T1 weighted sequence of the spinal bone marrow in this case is higher than that of the muscle, while in neoplastic bone marrow infiltration there is lower T1 signal relative to the disk and paraspinal muscle.
