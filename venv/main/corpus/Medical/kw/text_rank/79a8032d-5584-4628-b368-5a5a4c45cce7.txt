Metastatic cancer is the most common malignant tumor of the liver. The ratio of metastatic disease to primary liver tumors is 18:1.  Imaging appearance varies based on the primary tumor origin. Lung, GI, lymphoma, and most breast cancers are hypovascular lesions. On CT these lesions will generally appear as low attenuation with peripheral enhancement.  These findings indicate a necrotic/hypovascular center with a well vascularized viable tumor in the periphery. Endocrine, renal, thyroid, sarcomas and melanomas are generally hypervascular lesions. On contrast enhanced CT they appear hyperdense in late arterial phase images. Some lesions can have variable enhancement secondary to internal necrosis. On non-contrast enhanced CT or portal venous images these lesions appear iso- or hypodense.
