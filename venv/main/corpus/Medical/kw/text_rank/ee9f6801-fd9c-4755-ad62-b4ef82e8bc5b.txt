SECONDARY CUTANEOUS B-CELL LYMPHOMA, FOLLICULAR CENTER CELL TYPE (1997 Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, Case#15B) submitted by: Mark W. Cobb, CAPT, MC, USN
patient was well until April,1996, when he developed an asymptomatic lesion on the right cheek. He subsequently developed multiple lesions on the face, upper trunk, and shoulders and cervical adenopathy. A skin biopsy from the back in November, 1996 was diagnosed as malignant lymphoma, B-cell, follicular center cell origin. Further work-up at NNMC revealed: (1) biopsy of two cervical lymph nodes - malignant lymphoma, indolent, bcl-2 and L-26 positive, consistent with B-phenotype, follicular center cell origin; (2) CT scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis - multiple prominent cervical nodes up to 1 cm, multiple enlarged mesenteric nodes up to 1.5 cm, splenomegaly, and malrotation of the gut; (3) bone marrow biopsy - changes suggestive of lymphoma.
