Tender to palpation on dorsal aspect of midline wrist, right > left.
Splinting, intermittent icing of the wrist, and elevation.  Salter Harris Type 2A fractures have an excellent prognosis.  Plain films of both wrists (images unavailable) in this patient five weeks later revealed normal bones.
Widening of physis with extension into metaphysis bilaterally, right > left.  Sclerosis of metaphyseal edges bilaterally.  No displacement.
Bilateral Salter Harris Fracture Type 2A
Salter Harris fracture, Type 2
Overuse (stress) injury
12-year old Caucasian girl with a two-month history of bilateral wrist pain.  The patients was a gymnast who spent 14 hours per week training.
The original Salter Harris classification includes Types I to V.  Type I fractures result from a fracture limited to the growth plate itself and represents 6% of cases.  Type II involves a variable amount of growth plate with extension into the metaphysis and encompasses 75% of fractures.  Type III involves a fracture in the growth plate with extension into the epiphysis and accounts for 8%.  Type IV involves the growth plate with extension into both the epiphysis and metaphysis, and Type V results from a crush injury to the epiphyseal plate.  Type IV and Type V account for 10% and 1% of cases, respectively.

Each of the above types mainly affects those less than 18 years of age, and each one has a predilection to a different subset.  Type I mainly affects children less than 5 years of age, usually resulting from birth injury.  Type II and III mainly affects those aged 10-16 years.  Type IV also affects children who are 10-16 years of age, but can also be seen in younger children.  Type V occurs in older children, 12-16 years.  

Salter Harris Type II is the most commonly encountered type.  As stated above, it involves a variable length of physis with extension into the metaphysis.  The fracture line can cause a characteristic finding on radiograph, a metaphyseal fragment of bone.  This is called the Thurston Holland or corner sign.   Salter Harris Type II tends to affect large ossification centers.  The most common site of occurrence is the distal end of the radius.  Other sites include the distal portions of the tibia, fibula, femur and ulna.   

Type II is divided into four subtypes.  Type IIB is differentiated from Type IIA by presence of a free metaphyseal fragment.  Type IIC occurs when the fracture line into the metaphysis is parallel to the growth plate, and occurs with or without the triangular fragment.   Type IID involves crushing injury, usually when the metaphyseal bone fragment dives into the physis.   
Given that Salter Harris fractures affect the growth plate, growth plate arrest can occur.  Arrest of growth can cause a bridge of bone to form between the metaphysis and epiphysis, which can be seen on radiographs but is best seen with CT or MRI.  This complication usually occurs more in Type IID, IV and V fractures, especially in those fractures that are displaced.  In addition, fractures with bone fragments can cause difficulty with treatment, should orthopedic surgery be indicated.

This patientâ€™s fractures represent Type IIA fractures, which have a very good prognosis.  The mechanism of injury for this patient who is a gymnast is persistent straining and twisting of the upper extremities.  With supportive care including splinting of injury, rest, ice, and elevation, radiographs from a five week follow up demonstrated normal bones.
