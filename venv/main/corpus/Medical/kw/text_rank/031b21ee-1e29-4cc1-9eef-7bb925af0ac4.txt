The patient will need a PET or CT to complete her metastatic workup. Palliative external beam radiotherapy can be utilized for local tumor control, and to reduce her symptoms. Subsequent systemic chemotherapy will be required.
•CXR: New bandlike area of opacification in the left upper lobe, not seen on previous exam. 

•CT chest w/ contrast: Large aggregation of mediastinal adenopathy involving left and right paratracheal, subcarinal, prevascular, aortic window, and left hilar nodes. There is partial obstruction of the left main stem bronchus and at the carina, likely representing peribronchial invasion. There is a significant mass effect on the left pulmonary artery and left subclavian vein, with possible invasion. In the left upper lobe there is a 2 cm spiculated focus of consolidation. 
In the right hepatic lobe of the liver, near the dome, there is a 1.2 x 0.8 cm area of low attenuation. Within segment 2 of the liver a 2.2 x 3.5 cm hypoattenuating lesion demonstrates peripheral enhancement. A similar lesion is seen in segment 8 of the right lobe, measuring 1.2 x 2.4 cm. 
There is a low-attenuating pericardial effusion.
Adenocarcinoma of the Lung

•Metastatic cancer to the lung 
•Pneumoconiosis
•Sarcoidosis
•Asbestosis
•Pneumonia
60 year old woman presents with acute shortness of breath. She also endorses hoarseness, chest discomfort, cough, and increasing sputum production over the past 6 months. She denies any chest pain, hemoptysis, fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss. She endorses significant secondhand smoke exposure for the past six years. 
Chest x-ray performed one month ago did not reveal any abnormalities. She was diagnosed with a URI and treated with two courses of antibiotics at the time.
Based on the findings of the CXR there was a broad differential to consider. It appeared as if there were a single nodule, which could be caused by a number of benign processes as well as malignancy. However, when a CT scan was obtained it showed that the diagnosis was most likely not benign. Not only did it show additional tissue involvement, it revealed an invasive process with lymphadenopathy. While the AST elevation may not have been impressive, the presence of multiple nodules that appeared similar in density to the pulmonary process must bring to mind malignant metastases. 

Given this patient's age and exposure to smoke, lung cancer should be at the top of the differential. Her new cough and SOB signaled the increasing amount of pulmonary invasion. The hoarseness she was experiencing could be explained by involvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve as it hooks around the aortic arch. In addition leukocytosis and thrombocytosis can be seen with lung cancer. While the exposure to smoke and predominately central pulmonary involvement might make you favor small cell or squamous cell carcinoma, this patient actually had atypical adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma of the lung is the most common histologic type of lung cancer.
