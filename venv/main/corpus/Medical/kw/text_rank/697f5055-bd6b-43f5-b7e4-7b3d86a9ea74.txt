Scars on Abdomen from Previous Surgeries. Physical exam is otherwise unremarkable.
Patient Treated with Xelox [Capecitabine plus Oxiliplatin]Chemotherapy. Repeat imaging has showed modest decrease in the size of his hepatic lesion. Typically patients with metastases this advanced have very poor prognosis.
The first image shows a 1 x 1 cm area of hypoattnuation in the left lobe of the liver. This was the image taken when the patient presented with his abdominal complaints. His symptoms resolved and he failed to follow up. The second and third images are from a year later. They show a left hepatic lobe mass that has diminished attenuation and heterogeneous enhancement.  The mass measures approximately 4 x 4cm and there is intrahepatic ductal dilatation distal to the mass lesion
Metastatic Colon Cancer
1. Metastatic Colon Cancer
2. Primary Cholangiocarcinoma, or Hepatocellular Carcinoma
3. Benign Hepatoma
69 year old male with remote history of Colon Cancer status post total colectomy 9 years ago presents with unintentional weight loss and vague abdominal pain. Patient Currently smokes 1/2 pack/day.

Past Medical history notable for:
Diabetes Mellitus Type 2,
Hypertension,
Atrial Fibrillation
This case brings to light the utility of CT in the post operative period as a method of surveillance for recurrence and or metastases of a primary colon cancer. In 2005, the American Society of Clinical Oncology [ASCA] updated their post resection surveillance recommendations to include yearly CT for patients who had stage II or worse disease. They had previously recommended against CT monitoring but unanimously changed their recommendation after 3 meta-analyses all showed significant decrease in mortality when post op CT surveillance was done. The decrease was due to early identification of resectable hepatic metastases!

ASCA recommended a surveillance period of 3 years based on the average length of the meta-analyses. Given that our patient was 9 years post resection, these guidelines would not have affected his outcome.
