Chiari I with cervical spine syrinx.
No differential with these findings.
25 year old female with history of headaches
This case nicely demonstrates the imaging features of the Chiari I malformation.  The syrinx is easily visualized and is the only other associated abnormality in this case.  There was no hydrocephalus or associated skeletal anomalies.  The patient had been complaining only of headaches.
