Physical exam demonstrated an elderly male who was alert and oriented times two.  Patient did not have slurred speech or weakness.  Laboratory work was unremarkable.
This was an incidental finding and no treatment or follow up is necessary unless patient symptomatology changes.
An axial CT through the brain demonstrates a rounded soft tissue mass adherent to the anterior falx on the right.  The mass appears to contain some calcification centrally.  On post contrast images, this mass strongly and homogenously enhances.   The remaining evaluation of the brain is unremarkable with preservation of grey-white matter differentiation throughout.  No hyperdenities were seen to suggest acute hemorrhage.

88-year old male presents to the emergency room with one-day history of mental status changes, per patient caregiver.
Meningiomas are well-defined extra-axial masses with a peak incidence in patients 40-60 years of age.  This was an incidental finding in this patient, imaged for stroke evaluation.  The female to male ratio is 2:1.  These are the most common nonglial intracranial tumor.  Meningiomas are predominantly benign with malignant meningiomas being exceedingly rare.

On CT images, meningiomas can be isodense with brain, homogenously hyperdense, or variably calcified.  This case demonstrates central stippled calcification.  They typically enhance strongly post contrast administration, as in this case.  60% of tumors will demontrate a dural tail on MRI imaging, which represents either the tumor itself or underlying dural reaction.  This is not specific for meningiomas, however.
