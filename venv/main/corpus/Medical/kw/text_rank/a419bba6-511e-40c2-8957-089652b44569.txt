Non surgical symptomatic medical management
Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate no acute cardiopulmonary disease (clear lungs) as well as senescent change within the aorta and spine.  Additionally a soft tissue density mass is present within the middle mediastinum with an internal air fluid level behind the heart disrupting the azygoesophageal edge.

Axial CT images with oral and intravenous contrast material demonstrate a sliding hiatal hernia with the gastroesophageal junction and a portion of the proximal stomach superior to the diaphragm.  An MPR obliqued image further demonstrates this superior migration of the gastroesophageal junction into the thorax.
Hiatal Hernia
Based upon the radiographs:
Hiatial hernia (sliding versus paraesophageal versus mixed)
Foregut duplication cyst
Abscess
Necrotic lymph node with cavitation

Diagnosis of a sliding hiatal hernia is confirmed with CT.
74 year old female with dyspnea on exertion.
