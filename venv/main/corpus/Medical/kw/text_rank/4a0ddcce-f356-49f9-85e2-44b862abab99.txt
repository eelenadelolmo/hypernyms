The left upper arm exam is significant for a firm, nontender, nonmobile mass on his proximal left humerus.
This lesion is benign and requires no specific treatment.  These lesions can cause mechanical discomfort and can be resected for this reason.  These lesions are monitored for development of pain which may be a precurser or a symptom of malignant degeneration.  The cartilaginaous cap is less than 1 cm consistent with a benign osteochondroma.
