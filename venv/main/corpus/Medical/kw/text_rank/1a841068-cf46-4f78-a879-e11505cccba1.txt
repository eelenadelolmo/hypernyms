24 year-old woman with lower abdominal pain that brought her to the ER during a business trip to the area.  She reports a prior right fallopian tube ectopic pregnancy 2 years earlier that was treated with surgery that spared her right ovary.  She notes that this pain feels different.
While not a known diagnosis for the patient, 2 ectopic pregnancies, with 1 on each side is concerning for pelvic inflammatory disease among other etiologies.  Cultures for sexually transmitted diseases are pending.  If she desires to conceive, hysterosalpingogram may help to define whether her anatomy is normal.
