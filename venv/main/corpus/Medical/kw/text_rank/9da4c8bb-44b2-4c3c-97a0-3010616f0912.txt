Treatment:
        Treatment options:
          - Limb lengthening or contralateral epiphysiodesis (or both)for mild cases;
          - Iliofemoral fusion
                - main disadvantage: inability for prosthesis to allow
                    ischial containment
Severe hypoplasia of the right femur.
Proximal Focal Femoral Deficiency
Developmental dysplasia of the hip (not as severe as this case)
Proximal focal femoral deficiency (PFFD)
Postsurgical state
Common history may include limb length discrepancies, malrotation, proximal joint instability, and inadequacy of the proximal musculature.
