Swelling and tenderness over the left anterior tibial tuberosity.
The lateral view of the left knee reveals irregular ossification of the anterior tibial tuberosity, abnormal width of the distal portion of the apophyseal plate, calcifications within the distal patellar tendon, and indistinctness of the patellar tendon. Soft tissue swelling localized to a prominence over the tibial tuberosity is present as well, although this is difficult to visualize secondary to the higher penetration.
 The remainder of the views of the left knee are normal.
Osgood-Schlatter Disease
14yo Caucasian male with 2 day history of pain, swelling, and tenderness over the left anterior tibial tuberosity. No history of trauma.
Osgood-Schlatter disease is generally a benign, self- limited condition primarily affecting rapidly growing, active adolescents. The etiology is currently believed to be secondary to recurrent microtrauma from repeated flexion of the quadriceps. The diagnosis is primarily based on clinical findings, supported by radiographic studies. Clinical findings include history of pain, swelling, and tenderness localized to the tibial tuberosity. The knee and joint space is normal on exam except for swelling and tenderness over the tuberosity (symptoms may be reproduced by stressing the quadriceps).
Radiological findings that contribute to the diagnosis of OsgoodÂ¬Schlatter include: 1) irregular or fragmented ossification of the tibial tuberosity, 2) calcifications within the patellar tendon, 3) indistinct margins or thickening of the patellar tendon, 4) local soft tissue swelling, 5) abnormally wide distal portion of the apophyseal plate, and 6) increased radiodensity of infrapatellar fat pad. Irregular ossification alone, without any of these other findings, is not diagnostic and may only represent a normal variant.
An understanding of the normal ossification of the proximal tibia aids in the interpretation of knee films to rule out irregular ossification (as found in Osgood-Schlatter). In the fetus, the diaphysis of the tibia begins to ossify. At birth, the epiphysis has started to develop an ossification center. Around approximately 7 years of age, the anterior surface of the proximal tibia (in the region of the tuberosity) develops a center of ossification. This center is an accessory to the epiphysis, and at approximately age 13-15 this center fuses with the epiphysis. Therefore, what may appear as irregular calcification may represent a variant stage of normal ossification.
The prognosis of Osgood-Schlatter is excellent, with the majority of cases resolving spontaneously. Symptomatic treatment with analgesics and temporary minor restrictions in activity are typical treatment modalities.
