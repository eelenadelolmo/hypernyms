Normal vital signs.
Negative neurological and physical exam (although there is some question as to whether he had an otoscopic examination).

Large enhancing mass in the  right middle cranial fossa.  There is extension of mass into (or out of) the right middle ear and mastoid air cells.  The lesion also contains blood products - based on SWI images.  No restricted diffusion noted.
Brain abscess, Chronic and acute micro-abscesses
• Meningioma
• Sarcoma
• Langerhans Cell Histocytosis
• Mastoiditis with intradural/parenchymal abscess
15 year old previously healthy boy, now with a 2 day history of headache.  Was taken to ER by family because of progressive pain and confusion.
The lack of systemic signs, for such a large intracranial lesion, is truly remarkable.  There is a complex mixture of intraaxial (brain) and extraaxial (subdural/epidural) abnormalities in this case.   In addition, the mastoid and middle ear fluid suggest an otogenic infection that has spread intracranially and intradurally.
