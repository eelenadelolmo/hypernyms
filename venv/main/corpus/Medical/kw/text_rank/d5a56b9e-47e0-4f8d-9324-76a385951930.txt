Vital signs were normal.  The patient was found to have decreased sensation in the right arm and assymetric strength in the right arm flexion/ extension (4/5) versus the left arm (5/5).
Asymptomatic patients can be followed with serial MRI.  Symptomatic patients may undergo surgical enlargment of the posterior fossa.
The cerebellar tonsils extend approximately 1 cm below
the foramen magnum.  The visualized posterior fossa appears normal in size.  There is increased T2 signal and decreased T1 signal of the spinal cord, particularly at the C7 and T4 vertebral body levels with focal dilatation of the central canal, consistent with syrinx.
