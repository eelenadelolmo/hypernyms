Laboratory data no available
The filter in this case was retrieved in a technically proficient manner but a huge clot burden remained.  Prudence should have dictated that it be left in place for a greater period of time, while the patient received anticoagulant or thrombolytic therapy
Multiple images from fluoroscopy during the angiographic procedure demonstrates:

The presence of the Gunther Tulip IVC filter, with the characteristic small loop at the end which facilitates retrieval.

The IVC filter firmly engaged with the retrieval loop system.

The filter being drawn into the larger coaxial retrieval sheath system.

The filter removed, with the outer coaxial retrieval sheath remaining in the IVC.

Cavagram performed through the sheath demonstrating the still-present eccentric filling defect in the infrarenal IVC.
Retrieval of a Gunther Tulip Vena Cava Filter
Gunther Tulip Retrievable Vena Cava Filter removal
Patient had placement of a Gunther Tulip Retrievable inferior vena cava filter placed three weeks prior for a large thrombus within the infrarenal inferior vena cava, extending into the left common iliac vein temporarily for a surgical procedure, now to be removed and patient to be anticoagulated.
Treatment in this case was inadequate.  The operator was adhering as closely as possible to the FDA approved time limit (14 days) for implantation of a Gunter-Tulip Filter prior to its retrieval.  However, because of the persistent clot burden, the filter should have been redeployed in a slightly different location if incorporation of the hooks of the filter legs into the IVC was really of concern.  Practically, The Gunter-Tulip can be retrieved months after deployment without problems.
