•Isolated finding
9 month old girl presented to Developmental Clinic from her primary care physician for failure to thrive, and failure to attain developmental milestones.  She was not crawling, was not able to sit supported, she was hypertonic, and was constipated (1-2 hard, dry stools per week), and had only a two word vocabulary.  Her mother denied a history of fevers, emesis, feeding difficulty, and seizures.  She had an uncomplicated gestational period and was born vaginally at full term.  Birth weight: 6 lbs  3 oz.  Mom feeds the pt 32 oz/ day of Simlac with Iron, and 2 jars of apple sauce  per day..
This patient displays bilateral open lipped schizencephally which has the poorest prognosis for neurologic development.  The association between schizencephaly and heterotopias is most commonly reported to be polymicrogyria, so the significance of this patients combination is not well characterized.
