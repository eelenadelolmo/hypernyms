Vitals - afebrile, tachycardic at 110, bp, resp and O2 sats wnl

GU - guiac positive stool in the rectal vault.  Normal rectal tone, normal prostate exam.

Abdomen - soft, diffusely, minimally tender to palpation.  No organomegaly noted.  Normal, active bowel sounds.

Lab : Hemoglobin/hematocrit (baseline) 13/40, (initial presentation-prior to colon prep) 10/30, (after colon prep and before transsfusion) 6/18, (after transfusion) 9/27.  
All other lab studies, including stool studies, were negative.
Surgery was definitive management, and the patient, as expected, has had no further GI bleeding.

22 year old presented to the hospital with a one day complaint of BRBPR approximately 12 hours prior to presentation.  The blood was characterized as dark red, and appeared on the stool, on the tissue and in the toilet bowl.  The blood passage was associated with cramping abdominal pain.  The patient had a similar experience once before, approximately one year prior, for which he did not see medical attention.  
During the course of his stay, he was found to be anemic.  He was initially volume resucitated with crystalloid. He had a negative upper endoscopy.  During the course of his lower endoscopy prep, he had a copious passage of bloody diarrhea, which worsened his anemia.  He was transfused 2 units PRBCs.  His lower endoscopy was also negative, and his bleeding had resolved.  It was decided to send the patient for a Meckel's scan.
Unique to this case is the patient age upon presentation.  Typically we think of a Meckel's diverticulum manifesting in childhood, but clearly it must remain in the differential diagnosis for any adult with endoscopically negative GI bleeding.
