Diffuse right upper quadrant pain.  Increased WBC count.  Otherwise, all exams and laboratories were within normal limits.
In the first image, which was a CT without contrast, it was hard to visualize appendix completely or with any degree of certainty.  The ER physicians were concerned enough to order a follow-up study CT with contrast.  The second image shows a markedly inflamed and enlarged appendix.  The cecum is also misplaced (medial to the appendix) when compared to it's usual location (lateral to the appendix on imaging), which is most likely due to a loose mesenteric attachment (and not cecal malrotation).
