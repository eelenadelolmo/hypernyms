Patient was admitted to medicine and remained stable.  No cause for her abdominal pain could be identified.  Her pain improved and she was discharged to home.  Recommended follow up ultrasound in 1 year to look for increase in size of AAA.
4x4 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm that is partially saccular at it's inferior margin.  Aneurysm begins 2 cm below the origin of the left renal artery and extends to the level of the bifurcation of the common illiac ateries.  The aneurysm does not extend into the illiac arteries.  There is an incompletely calcified rim around the aneurysm.  No change in size of AAA from prior studies.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm
N/A
89 year old white female with sub-acute onset of abdominal pain with a known AAA.  Patient describes pain as stabbing, non-radiating, mid-epigastric pain with no aggravating or alleviating factors.
In a patient with a known AAA and abdominal pain you must rule out a ruptured AAA.  If patient is stable CT with contrast should be performed.  
Signs of a ruptured AAA on CECT include: anterior displacement of kidney, extravasation of contrast material, fluid collection/hematoma within posterior para and perirenal spaces, free intraperitoneal fluid, and perirenal "cobwebs".  
Signs of a contained leak include: laminated mural calcification, periaortic mass of mixed/soft tissue density, and lateral "draping" of aneurysm around vertebral body.
