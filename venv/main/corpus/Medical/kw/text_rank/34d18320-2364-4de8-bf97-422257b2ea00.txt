N/A
This patient is currently undergoing a vaccine trial for prostate cancer.  He has had no metastatic disease since 2001.
Plain Radiographs:
Lateral image of the lumbar spine reveals multiple levels of round osteoblastic lesions in the vertebral bodies of the lumbar spine.

Whole Body Bone Scan:
Increased radiotracer accumulation in the medial aspect of the right clavicle, the right acetabulum, right superior ramus, left side of T9 and right side of L4, multiple other areas throughout the spine, the right proximal humerus, the left femoral neck, and, possibly, the medial aspect of the anterior right first rib.  There is also a focus of increased tracer in the right occipital region.
Metastatic Prostate Cancer
PARTIAL LIST FOLLOWS (and considers intensity of uptake)
-Other cancers resulting in osteoblastic skeletal metastases. 
-Multifocal osteomyelitis
-Fibrous dysplasia (polyostotic)
-Hyperparathyroidism
-Hyperthyroidism
-Osteomalacia
55 year old male with prostate cancer.
Prostate cancer is a common cause of osseous metastatic disease.    Tumor may spread through Batson&#8217;s venous plexus and via extension through pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes.  Osteoblastic lesions are typical, but lytic lesions do sometimes occur, resulting in false negative bone scans.  The relative frequency of skeletal lesions in radiographs is approximately 35% compared to 62% to 92% in osseous scintigraphy.
