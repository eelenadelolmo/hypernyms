PT 11.8, ESR and CRP normal (15 and 0.6 respectively), CBC unremarkable
Exam is significant for tenderness and pain to palpation over the greater trochanter of the right hip, no effusions were palpated.  Limited ROM of right lower extremity due to pain with internal/external rotation of hip, strength is 4/5 in RLE.  Gait is antalgic as patient tries to keep right leg straight with ambulation.  Skin was warm and dry with no rashes or erythema present.
AP and frog leg radiographs of the hips bilaterally were performed in the emergency department which demonstrated the findings described above which were consistent with the diagnosis of Legg-Calve-Perthes disease.

The patient was given Lortab elixir for pain and crutches to provide support for ambulation.  The orthopedic team was consulted and evaluated the patient.  They determined that the risk of joint aspiration outweighed the benefits and would be unnecessary.  In addition they found the patient to be stable and decided to have her seen in their clinic later in the week, but that hospitalization was not warranted.
Right femoral head demonstrates interval loss of height and increased sclerosis with marginal irregularity, consistent with osteonecrosis.  A focal lucency is present overlying the right femoral epiphysis, potentially secondary to proximal femoral epiphyseal collapse and/or joint effusion.  The right acetabulofemoral joint space is slightly wider than the left.  Possible effusion of right hip joint as suggested by mild asymmetric lateral convex displacement of the fat plane around the joint.
Legg-Calve-Perthes disease
1.	Osteonecrosis
2.	Septic arthritis
3.	Toxic synovitis
4.	Osteomyelitis
5.	Langerhans cell histiocytosis
6.	Slipped capital femoral epiphysis
7.	Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis
8.	Fracture
9.	Lymphoma
8 yo girl, with well controlled seizure disorder, presented to the ER with fever and complaints of 3-4 days of right sided hip pain.  The patient is still able to ambulate however she is hesitant to bear her full weight on the right leg.  She reports that doing so is uncomfortable and increases the pain.
