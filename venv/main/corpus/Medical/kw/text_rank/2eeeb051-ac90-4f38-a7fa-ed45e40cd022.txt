After attempts at medical management, the patient underwent Heller myotomy that failed to provide acceptable symptomatic relief.

An esphagectomy with gastic pull-up procedure was performed that continues to be complicated by strictures at the anastomic site.
- Initial free flow of barium through the esophagus.  Followed by tertiary waves and to-and-fro motion of barium.  

- Accumulation of barium in the esophagus with delayed opening of the lower esophageal sphincter.

-Multiple occasions of opening and emptying into the stomach without beaking of the lower esophageal sphincter. 

- Corkscrew or rosary bead esophagus.
Diffuse Esophageal Spasm
o Primary Esophageal Motility Disorders (PEMD)
  -  Diffuse Esophageal Spasm (DES)
  -  Achalasia/Vigorous Achalasia
  -  Nonspecific Esophageal Motility Disorder (NEMD)
o Secondary Esophageal Motility Disorders
  - Scleroderma, DM, Alcohol related, Psychiatric, Presbyesophagus
Presents with history of dysphagia and odynophagia for 8 months. Unable to eat food without it feeling stuck in his throat.  UGI at another institution in Ohio was reported positive for achalasia.
In this case, intermittent relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter favored the diagnosis of diffuse esophageal spasm over that of true achalasia.  

Treatment options included:

o Medical- Smooth muscle relaxants (nitrates, CCB, endo dilation)

o Surgical- Myotomy (LES), Extended Myotomy (DES), Esophagectomy
