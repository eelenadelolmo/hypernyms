The left tympanic membrane was intact and within normal limits s/p tympanoplasty. 

On the right, a blue-green hue was noted behind the posterior inferior tympanic membrane.
The patient was sent for CT to rule out medialized PE tube in left middle ear; and, that was confirmed by imaging.

There are no clear guidelines regarding treatment of medial displaced PE tubes.  Leaving them in place and surgical removal both carry risks that must be considered.  If left in place, possibilities include a foreign body reaction, nidus for infection, and physical obstruction of the Eustachian tube or ossicles.  Surgical removal carries some risk of hearing loss and infection.  Either course of action should be regularly followed for complications.
CT showed round hollow structure in inferior portion of middle ear consistent with size and shape of PE tube.

17 year old girl with history of chronic otitis media resulting in multiple ear surgeries including bilateral PE (pressure equalization) tubes (2 yrs. ago), tympanoplasties, and canalplasty/meatoplasty>  She returns for routine follow up exam of external ear canals.  She had no complaints, and reported stable hearing.  She wears a hearing aid in right ear from previously diagnosed mild sensorineural hearing loss.
Since the patient was asymptomatic and already had mild hearing loss in her right ear, the risk of hearing loss from surgery in the left ear had to be carefully considered.  She and her parents were given the option of surgical removal of the PE tube, or continuing regular follow up with observation.    Eventually, the patient and her parents decided that surgery was the better option, and plan to follow through before the end of the year.
