She is to follow up on an outpatient basis to have a flexible sigmoidoscopy performed.
Markedly abnormal appearance of the majority of the colon consistent with pneumatosis intestinalis.  Multiple cystic lucencies are present diffusely within the colonic wall with sparing of the distal descending and distal transverese colon.  Cystic changes are most pronounced at the hepatic and splenic flexures.
Pneumatosis cystoides coli
Mucosal Disruption
• Idiopathic
• Trama : s/p endoscopy, surgery
• Infection/inflammation: Crohn's, Ulceratice Colitis, C. difficile infection.

Pulmonary Disease/Process
• Bronchopleural fistula
• COPD- chronic bronchitis, bullous lung disease
• Asthma
• Trauma- barotrauma, chest tube

Increased Mucosal Permeability
• s/p chemotherapy or radiation
• Collagen vascular disease

Other
• Gas in the lumen of the bowel
33 y.o. woman with a history of mediastinal B-cell lymphoma that was diagnosed six years ago.  She has received chemotherapy consisting of Bleomycin, Doxyrubicin, and Cytoxin, as well as localized radiation.  Her clinical course was subsequently complicated by a paralyzed right hemi diaphragm.  Three years ago she was diagnosed with MAC and treated with rifabutin and clarithromycin for approx 3 years with persistent cultures after 18 months of therapy.  She has also been treated with Methotrexate and Prednisone for recurrent episodes of scleritis of which an autoimmune work up has been negative.   She was admitted at the beginning of August for increased cough and hemoptysis as well as bloody diarrhea.  At the time of admission she also had a complaint of increased eye pain.  In brief, during her admission she was evaluated by Infectious disease who made no changes to her MAC therapy medications, Ophthalmology was concerned for worsening scleritis and increased her oral steroids to 40mg qd, Cardiothoracic surgery who discussed possible resection of her damaged RUL and chronic infections, as well as Pulmonary who performed a bronchoscopy to obtain cultures as well as to localized her hemoptysis.  No evidence of bleeding was noted and her cultures of the RUL have grown Aspergillus niger. Her MAC cultures are still pending at this time.  She was also evaluated during this admission by GI for her diarrhea and her incidental finding of Pneumatosis cystoides coli.
The exact time of onset of this patient’s pneumatosis is not clear.  While literature case studies do report an association of pneumatosis intestinalis with chemotheraputic agents such at Etoposide, this drug was not included in her treatment regimen. Further investigation of her medical imaging and medication history would be useful to identify the time of onset in order to attempt to correlate these findings with a specific medication of other medical intervention.  A PubMed MeSH literature search for MAC associated pneumatosis intestinalis did not produce any results.  While she does complain of diarrhea, obviously a very nonspecific symptom, she does not display a clinical appearance or evidence of an intraabdominal catastrophe.  Therefore, she most likely suffers from a benign course of pneumatosis intestinalis and should only be treated if she becomes significantly symptomatic.  Treatment options, outlined in the topic introduction, include high-flow oxygen therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, antibiotics and special diets.
