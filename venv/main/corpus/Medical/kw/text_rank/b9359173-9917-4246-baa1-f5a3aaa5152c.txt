Noncontrast axial computed tomographic images of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate a 3 mm calculus within the right ureter at the ureterovesical junction with mild dilitation of the right renal pelvis and right ureter suggesting a degree of obstruction.  Two nonobstructing calculi within the upper pole of the right kidney and a single nonobstructing calculus within the interpolar region of the left kidney are also demonstrated.  There are no solid or cystic renal lesions.  The left ureter is of normal caliber and follows a normal course without evidence of ureterolithiasis.
