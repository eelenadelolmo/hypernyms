Unable to move right arm, significant swelling and eccymosis.
Initial casting and immobilization with follow up radiographs.  If adequate healing not occuring, may consider placement of bone chips within the lesion for additional support.
AP Radiograph of Proximal Humerus in internal rotation shows a comminuted, primarily spiral fracture through the right proximal humerus at the junction of the middle and proximal thirds.  The fracture is pathologic, extending through a lytic lesion that extends from the physeal scar to the inferior margin of the fracture site.  The lesion is centrally located, geographic, lucent and thins the endosteum with endosteal ridging  appreciated.  The findings are consistent with a Unicameral Bone Cyst.
