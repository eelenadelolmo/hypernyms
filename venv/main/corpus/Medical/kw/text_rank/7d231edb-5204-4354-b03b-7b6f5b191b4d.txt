Pathology results were as follows:
-Specimen size 9.0 x 2.0 x 0.9 cm
-Serosal surface with moderate amount of white fibrinous exudate but no evident perforation
-Largest single wall thickness measured 0.4 cm
CT with oral and IV contrast demonstrates an enlarged appendix with incomplete proximal contrast filling ("arrow sign") and surrounding inflammation but no evident rupture.  A small quantity of right pelvic free fluid without abscess.

33 year-old man with fever, nausea, loss of appetite and right lower quadrant abdominal pain.
This is a good example of a case in which the clinical scenario strongly suggested appendicitis and the CT demonstrated acute appendicitis.  Performance and interpretation of the CT was prioritized within our department and showed no evidence of perforation or abscess.  Following prompt resection, Pathology confirmed no perforation.
