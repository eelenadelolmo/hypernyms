Patient presented after a 9-month cruise - his parents did not recognize his face.  His nose was bigger and his eyes were farther apart than they remembered.  He complained of slight frontal headaches, but had no other symptoms.
The patient had not noticed the cosmetic effects on his face of the expanding sinonasal fungal ball; nor did his coworkers aboard the ship.  It was only after he saw that his parents did not recognize him that anyone realized that his face had changed shape.  This may be due to the slowly progressive changes.
