This was a case of idiopathic synovial osteochondromatosis.  
Synovial osteochondromatosis is an unusual entity with unknown cause.  It results from metaplasia of the sub-synovial connective tissue into cartilage nodules that may then later calcify or ossify.  Synovial osteochondromatosis typically affects young adults and occurs most frequently in the knee and hip and less frequently by descending order the shoulder, elbow and ankle.    Typically it is monoarticular.  Clinical symptoms include pain, swelling and loss of joint motion.

Typical radiographic features include multiple calcified or ossified bodies of approximately equal size.  However, when no calcification or ossification occurs, it may be undetected by plain radiographs.  Also erosions can occur in “tight” joints such as the hips.  Joint space narrowing, periarticular osteoporosis and adjacent bone sclerosis may be seen.
