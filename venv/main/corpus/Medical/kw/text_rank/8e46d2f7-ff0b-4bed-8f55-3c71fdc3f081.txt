Gray-scale sonographic images through the right lower quadrant show an inflamed appendix.  This dilated, fluid-filled, noncompressible, blind-ending tubular structure measured 8 mm in diameter, with increased periappendieal echogenicity representing infiltration of mesenteric fat.  Additionally, note the target appearance caused by a fluid-filled lumen and an intact echogenic submucosal layer.

Color Doppler sonography showed marked hyperemia along the periphery of the appendix.
