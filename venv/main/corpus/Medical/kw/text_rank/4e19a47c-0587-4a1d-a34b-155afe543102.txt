Treatment for Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type II is generally supportive care as the baby often dies in utero or shortly after birth.  Genetic counseling is also recommended.
Osseous structures demonstrate diffuse osteopenia, which is markedly noted in the skull. There are multiple fractures within the axial and appendicular skeleton, to include multiple rib fractures and multiple fractures of the humeri and femora. The long bones of the extremities are crumpled and demonstrate bowing deformity with a characteristic accordian appearance. The pelvis is significant for flattening of the acetabula and iliac wings. Evaluation of the spine demonstrates multiple compression fractures of the vertebral bodies, which are decreased in height. Umbilical artery and vein central catheters are present.

Osteogenesis Imperfecta affects approximately 1/20,000 births world-wide. It is caused mainly by genetic mutations in genes coding for type 1 collagen (COL1A1/COL1A2) which is a building block for normal bone. With the mutations in type 1 collagen, bones become brittle and are easily fractured. OI is typically classified into 4 major types (Types I-IV) and is sometimes further classified into 3 more types (Types V-VII).

OI Type I is the mild and most common form and patients often can live a normal lifespan. Typical signs and symptoms include bone fragility, fractures, blue sclerae, short stature, hearing loss, and dental problems. The treatment for this form is often bisphosphonates which are medications often used for osteoporosis. This helps to strengthen the bone.

The infant in this case likely had OI Type II which is the most severe form and is often lethal as patients die either in utero or shortly after birth. Signs and symtoms include severe fractures that can often be seen in utero and very dark blue sclerae. The cause of death is usually due to pulmonary failure. Treatment for OI Type II consists of supportive care and genetic counseling is recommended.
