Mutliple stab wounds to the chest and abdomen
Falling hematocrit with active bleeding from the right upper quadrant stab wound.
Because of suspicious CT findings at admission, the patient was referred for visceral arteriography.  The patient required multiple blood transfusions due to decreasing hematocrit levels over the next week.  Therefore, a repeat CT and subsequent visceral arteriogram were performed.

After embolization, the patient's hematocrit was stabilized.
-Contrast- enhanced axial CT performed at admission demonstrate two lacerations within the medial and lateral segments of the left hepatic lobe  .There is a small collection of contrast within the medial segment laceration.  There is no subcapsular or extra-hepatic collection.

-Images from angiography performed the next day demonstrate no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm or active extravasation.  A proper hepatic arteriogram demonstrates opacification of the left hepatic lobe vasculature but no right lobe vasculature. Therefore, the superior mesenteric artery was selected and arteriography demonstrates the presence of a replaced right hepatic artery.

-Contrast-enhanced axial CT image performed approximately one week later demonstrates interval enlargement of the puddle of contrast within the medial segment laceration.

-DSA images from a celiac arteriogram demonstrate a new pseudoaneurysm arising from a segmental branch of the left hepatic artery.  This branch was subselected with a microcatheter and several coils deployed.  Subsequent celiac arteriogram demonstrates cessation of flow to the pseudoaneurysm.
Hepatic Artery Pseudoaneurysm
Arterial pseudoaneurysm.
This 47-year-old man sustained multiple stab wounds to the chest and abdomen.
