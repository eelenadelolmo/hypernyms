FLAIR MR images shows  high signal intensity in fissures, the axial T2 MR image demonstrates a flow void area cephalad to the planum   sphenoidale  - suggesting an aneurysm. 

Time Of Flight MR angiography  displays a large aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery (ACOMM).

Images were obtained one day after the ictus.

The most common cause of non-traumatic  subarachnoid hemorrhage is bleeding from a ruptured aneurysm.  Other causes are vascular malformations,  neoplasms, spinal diseases. Acute ,subacute and chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage can be  diagnosed with fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR)  MR imaging.  It is shown that FLAIR diagnostic images are superior to conventional MR or CT images in patiens with subacute subarachnoid hemorrhage.

In a prospective blinded comparison of 3D contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR angiography and compared  successfully with  conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in demonstrating  intracranial aneurysm.
