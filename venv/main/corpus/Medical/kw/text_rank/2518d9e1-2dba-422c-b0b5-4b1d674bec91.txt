Normal AST, ALT, Alk Phos, and Total Bilirubin.
No treatment or followup is necessary in this case.
Discontinuous peripheral pooling of contrast enhancement in the arterial phase with progressive filling seen in the portal venous phase and prolonged enhancement of the lesion in delayed images on a three phase enhanced liver CT.
Liver Hemangioma
DDX of hypodense liver lesion:
•	Cavernous hemangioma
•	Metastatic disease 
•	HCC
•	Focal Nodular Hyperplasia
•	Hepatic cyst
•	Fibrolamellar Carcinoma
•	Lymphoma
•	Hepatic Adenoma
38 y/o woman to evaluate liver lesion.
NOTE:  These are dynamic enhanced images that confirm benign hemangioma.  The discontinuous peripheral pooling of contrast enhancement in the arterial phase - followed by progressive filling seen in the portal venous phase - with prolonged enhancement of the lesion on the delayed images - is classic for hemangioma.
