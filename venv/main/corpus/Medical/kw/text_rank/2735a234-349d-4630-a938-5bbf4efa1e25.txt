Asymmetric protruberance of left facial features with left proptosis.
Pamidronate can be used to treat bone pain but does not of course improve the bony anatomy. 

Early treatment is key to prevent development of deformity. Amenable lesions can be treatmented with curettage and replacement with autograft or allograft, but this approach usually results in resorption of the graft into fibrous dysplasia; allograft or cortical autograft may delay this conversion.
Dysplastic bone of left cranium protrudes into left orbit with resulting left proptosis, as well filling much of the left naso-pharyngeal cavity. Intramendullary extension is present, but no cortical violation or soft-tissue involvement.
Fibrous Dysplasia
osteosarcoma (Low-grade, intraosseous-type osteosarcoma (LGIOS))
Paget disease
cherubism 
ossifying fibroma 
chronic osteomyelitis 
Ewing's sarcoma
Progressive facial deformity over a period of many years led patient to question whether surgical correction might be available.
The extensive nature of this patient's disease makes a curative result unlikely. A palliative approach is more reasonable
