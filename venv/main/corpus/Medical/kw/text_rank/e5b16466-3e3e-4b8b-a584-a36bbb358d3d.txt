Gastric adenocarcinoma, linitis plastica, spread to transverse colon via gastrocolic ligament.

At the time of case compilation, the patient was undergoing evaluation for palliative resection of his tumor burden vs. other therapeutic options to include chemotherapy.
Frontal fluoroscopic images from a solid column barium enema and subsequent upper GI study demontrate concentric annular long segment luminal narrowing of the gastric antrum which extends into the pyloric channel.  Also, these images demonstrate a concentric annular long segment narrowing of the lumen of the transverse colon from gastrocolic extension.  Axial CT images of the abdomen demonstrate gastric wall thickening and concentric narrowing of the gastric antrum and pylorus.  Axial CT images also demonstrate long segment narrowing of the transverse colon.  These findings are compatible with the patient&#34;s history of gastric adenocarcinoma with spread via the gastrocolic ligament to the transverse colon.
