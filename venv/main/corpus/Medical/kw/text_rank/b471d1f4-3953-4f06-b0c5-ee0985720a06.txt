Severe periumbilical pain, peritoneal signs.  Unable to tolerate oral contrast.
Procedure - Exploratory laparotomy with detorsion of small intestine, lysis of adhesions and closure of mesenteric defect.  Surgical findings included: large mesenteric defect at root of mesentery with volvulus of small bowel around SMA axis.  Some mesenteric venous congestion but bowel pink and healthy after detorsed.  No evidence of congenital malrotation.
Early studies demonstrate an internal transmesenteric small bowel hernia without volvulus or ischemia.

Recent study demonstrate the "whirl" sign - indicating twisting of the bowel and, hence, volvulus.  No evidence of intestinal ischemia or necrosis on CT (no submucosal enhancement, bowel wall thickening, free fluid or pneumatosis intestinalis).
Transmesenteric internal hernia, small bowel volvulus
Clinical difeerential diagnosis:

<li> Acute appendicitis
<li> Acute cholecystitis
<li> Mesenteric ischemia
<li> Volvulus

Imaging findings are diagnostic.
27 y/o woman with sudden onset of periumbilical abdominal pain relieved only by "bending forward".  Previous surgery -  gastric bypass 2 years ago.
Whirl sign - uncommonly seen - indicates twisting of the mesenteric vessels, or twisting of the bowel itself, that is diagnostic of volvulus.
