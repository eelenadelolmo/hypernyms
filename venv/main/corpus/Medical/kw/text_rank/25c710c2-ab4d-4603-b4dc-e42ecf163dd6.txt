PA and Lateral radiograph of the chest demonstrates no acute cardiopulmonary disease or lymphadenopathy.  A sclerotic rib lesion in the right posterior rib with an expansile characteristic was demonstrated which was concerning for metastatic disease.  

A CT of the rib lesion demonstrates a central lytic lesion with rib expansion.

CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate multiple hypodense heterogeneous peripherally enhancing lesions within the liver.

Circumferential thickening of the colon near the junction of the descending and sigmoid colonic segments was demonstrated which was concerning for adenocarcinoma given the constellation of findings.
Rib Metastasis from Colon adenocarcinoma (with metastatic involvement of the liver).
Rib lesion (Greater than 40 years old):
Metastatic disease
Plasmacytoma
Enchondroma
49 year old active duty officer with 6 month history of malaise, night sweats, spiking temperatures, weight loss, and non-productive cough.  Chest X ray with cavitary lesion in right middle lobe.  Recent travel to Kuwait.  Patient with elevated transaminases with abdominal pain..
Given the travel history and constitutional symptoms the clinicians suspected tuberculosis.  The initial chest radiograph was negative with the exception of the rib lesion.

The second chest radiograph obtained a month later demonstrated no acute cardiopulmonary disease, however, the image was misinterpreted as a cavitary lesion in the right middle lobe.  The pitfall in that observation was that the lesion was not demonstrated on the lateral view.  There was a contour abnormality of the rib, as correctly described by the radiologist, with a lucent lesion that was confirmed by chest CT.

The ultimate finding of the patient's diagnosis was by computed tomography.  No cardiopulmonary disease or adenopathy was demonstrated in the thorax.  The multiple heterogeneous lesions in the liver and contour abnormality in the colon was the cause of the patient's symptoms.  

With regard to metastatic disease to the liver as was demonstrated in this case, massive hepatomegaly may occur with pain secondary to distention of the liver capsule.  Distal spread to the lungs and bone may be slient until disease is advanced.

Given the advanced nature of the patient's primary neoplasm, the rib lesion is suspicious for metastatic disease to bone.
