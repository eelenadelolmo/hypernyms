Atypical pneumonia in ICL patients has not been well described.  Empiric therapy typically calls for Quinolone antibiotics to address the most common typical and atypical organisms seen in community acquired pneumonias.  As is the case in most C. pneumoniae infections, the bacteria are often difficult to isolate, and treatment regimens are often completed with full resolution of disease without ever having confirmed the causative organism.
