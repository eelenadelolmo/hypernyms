No laboratory abnormalities present.  Physical exam unremarkable.
C-sign:  continuous line extending from the talus to the sustenaculum tali and is visible on lateralradiographs.  The line is created by the combined shadow of the talar dome and the fused facets of the subtalar oint.

Talar beak:  osseous excrecence at the dorsal aspect of the talus—seen in all three types of the coaltion.  Similar type of ridge may be seen in other conditions.—abnormal capsular and ligamentous traction associated with degenerative changes.
Talocalcaneal coalition
21 year old active duty soldier with foot pain
Fusion of 2 or more tarsal bones—the fusion may be complete or incomplete and can be fibrous (syndesmosis), cartilagenous (synchondrosis), or osseous (synostosis)

Most common coalition occurs b/w the calcaneus and navicular, talus and calcaneous and talus and navicular.  Less frequently between the calcaneus and cuboid.

Despite being congenital, symptoms do not develop before the 2d or 3d decade.  On physical exam peroneal muscle spasm and restricted joint mobility (so-called peroneal spastic foot) can be demonstrated.

The primary sign of tarsal coalition is evidence of fusion 

Talocalcaneal:  most often occurs at the level of the sustentaculum tali and the middle facet of the subtalr joint.
