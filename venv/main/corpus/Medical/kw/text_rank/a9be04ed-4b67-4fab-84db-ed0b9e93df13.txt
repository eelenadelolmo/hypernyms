Due to the spleen’s key immunologic function in the fighting of infections with encapsulated organisms, splenectomy is a last resort with conservative therapy currently advocated.  As a result, arteriography with the option of embolization therapy is indicated after lacerations are evident on CT imaging of hemodynamically stable patient.  The goal of embolization is essentially to reduce the main arterial pressure head via the placement of coils proximally within the splenic artery.  Infarctions are thus prevented due to sufficient blood flow around the occlusive coils via collateral areteries already present.
CT demonstrates parenchymal splenic injuries and may demonstrate active extravasation of contrast if active hemorrhage is present.  Fluid densities within the dependent portions of the peritoneal cavity are often seen.

Angiography may demonstrate active hemorrhage and or mass effect secondary to adjacent hematoma causing compression.  Active hemorrhage would warrant proximal coil embolization to improve hemodynamic status.
Splenic laceration without coil embolization
Splenic laceration with or without frank hemorrhage, other visceral trauma with subsequent peritoneal fluid collections.

The spleen is the most frequently injured abdominal organ in blunt trauma accounting for approximately a quarter of all blunt injuries to the abdominal viscera.  Although peritoneal lavage can be diagnostic, CT has superceded its usage; although, some studies have demonstrated that this modality can underestimate the degree of splenic injury.  CT classification of splenic injuries has been proposed as follows:

Class I   Capsular disruption and/or subcapsular hematoma without significant parenchymal injury.

Class II  Single or multiple capsular and parenchymal defects that do not extend into the hilum or involve major vessels.

Class III  Deep lacerations extending into the hilum and involving major vessels.

Class IV Shattered spleen.

Although only 30 to 40% of patients present with hypotension, hemodynamic instability can be a presenting symptom that requires immediate intervention.  Abdominal pain often localized to the left upper quadrant can be present.  Left shoulder pain also known as Kehr’s sign may be exhibited upon supine or Trendelenburg positioning.  Balance’s sign represents free peritoneal fluid with dullness to percussion overlying the paracolic gutters, which disappears with positional changes.
