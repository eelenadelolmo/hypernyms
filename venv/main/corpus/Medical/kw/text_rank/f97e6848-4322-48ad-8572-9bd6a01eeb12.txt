Nonfocal neurological examination.
Symptomatic treatment.  Some neurosurgeons consider suboccipital decompression procedures for severe intractable symptoms.  Magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord, particularly of the cervical spinal cord, can be considered to rule out associated syringohydromyelia.
Noncontrast sagittal SE T1-weighted magnetic resonance images demonstrate low lying cerebellar tonsils (tonsillar ectopia) extending approximately 8 mm below the foramen magnum.  The signal intensity and morphology of the brainstem and cerebellum are otherwise within normal limits.
