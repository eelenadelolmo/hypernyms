A 1.4cm soft tissue density spiculated opacity - a solitary pulmonary nodule - is in the periphery of the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.  No other parenchymal lesions nor mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy is seen.

Nuclear medicine PET/CT fusion scan demonstrates increased F18-FDG metabolism in the right upper lobe nodule. The maximum standardized uptake value of this nodule was calculated and determined to be 5.65
