PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate stable right-sided chest tube without significant pneumothorax.  Multiple, small, metallic fragments projecting over the right shoulder and mid-lung noted.  Right mid-lung opacity is likely due to a contusion injury.  No focal consolidation or effusion.  The imaged osseous structures are unremarkable.

Axial and coronal reformatted images were obtained through the right shoulder at 1.25- and 0.4-mm collimation, respectively.  No intravenous contrast was administered.  Metallic fragments throughout the anterior portion of the shoulder, with a small fragment within the lung parenchyma and anterior portion of the glenohumeral joint.  A metallic fragment is visualized within the joint itself.  Area of hypodensity just lateral to the metallic fragment in the humeral head may represent beam hardening versus small fracture lucency.

21 y/o AD 2ID male in Ramadi standing guard with local heard and felt GS to right shoulder.  Evaluated in Iraq with chest tube placement and wound debridement.  Transferred to Landstuhl and then to WRAMC.  Does not recall if he has had operative procedures.  Patient doing well on admission.  No LOC at scene.  Patient began eating regular food, had regular diet at Andrews, as well as a bowel movement.  On evaluation, patient had good pain control, but had complaints of decreased ROM.
Imaging modalities in emergency radiology include conventional plain-film radiography, computed tomography, ultrasonography, nuclear scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging.  Plain-film radiographic imaging, however, is the chief imaging modality in emergency medicine because of its ready availability, relative low cost, and great diagnostic potential.  
     A chest radiograph must be obtained on all patients who have suffered significant blunt or penetrating trauma to the torso.  Radiographic studies are only obtained after the airway is secured, adequate ventilation is ensured, and the circulation is addressed.  The initial chest film obtained during the resuscitation of the trauma patient is usually a supine portable radiograph.  The trauma series, which includes the supine chest, cross-table lateral cervical spine, and anteroposterior (AP) pelvic radiographs should be ordered in all patients sustaining significant blunt force to the torso.  However, significant chest injuries may be missed by the initial study in a significant portion of patients.  Chest radiography may be necessary to reliable exclude large hemopneumothoraces, small hemothoraces, and small pneumothoraces.  A systematic analysis of all radiographs is necessary.  The presence of subcutaneous emphysema in a victim of blunt trauma implies that a pneumothorax is present even if it is not visible on the portable chest radiograph.  A hemothorax appears on an upright radiograph as blunting of the costophrenic sulcus or loss of the diaphragmatic margin.  Pulmonary contusions appear as areas of inhomogeneous opacifications of the lung.  
     In this patient, a pnemothorax was incorrectly diagnosed, as is the case on many occasions.  A systematic reading of all radiographs were completed, and no new findings were revealed.  Serial chest radiographs were completed, of note, also after the patient’s chest tube was removed.
