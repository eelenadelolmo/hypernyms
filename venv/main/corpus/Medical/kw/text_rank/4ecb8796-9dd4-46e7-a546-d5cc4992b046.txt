HCC occurs in 19-24% of pts with hemochromatosis, which is a 20 to 200 fold increased risk compared with the general population (similar to that of pts with cirrhosis secondary to viral hepatitis).  Risk factors include advancing age (>50), male sex, and the presence of cirrhosis.  LFT’s are often normal as the pathophysiology is not an inflammatory process.  HCC is the leading cause of death in pts with hemochromatosis (approximately 30%).  Other causes include cardiac failure resulting from iron deposition in the heart tissue and hepatic failure. 
FNH is almost always seen in women of childbearing age (90%) and is frequently associated with oral contraceptive use.
The remainder of the abdominal pelvic CT was neg for malignancy and pts unremarkable physical exam (non-cachectic) makes mets unlikely.
