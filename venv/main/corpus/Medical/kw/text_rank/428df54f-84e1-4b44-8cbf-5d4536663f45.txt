» Initial presentation:
• + Romberg Sign
• Dysdiadokinesis in right hand
• Tilts to the right side when performing tandem gait
• Decreased hearing in right ear
Patient went on to receive extensive resection of the mass via retrosigmoid and translabyrinthine approach (on month after initial scans).

Since the surgery, his headaches have decreased in quantity and quality. His dizziness has largely subsided. However, the following post surgical signs have developed:
• New decreased sensation to light touch in V1, V2, V3 divisions on right side
• New right sided facial droop
• New right sided tongue weakness when pushing tongue against cheek

He is currently receiving radiation treatment for further reduction of residual tumor. He will be re-evaluated for possible re-resection of mass given amount of cytoreduction following completion of adjuvant treatment.
MRI of Cervical Spine (October 2010):
» 4.5 cm right cerebellopontine angle mass extending into the right internal auditory canal

Brain MRI with and without contrast:
» Heterogeneously enhancing mass lesion measuring 5.0 x 3.0 cm extending intracanalicularly on the right side. Also extends upwards to and above the tentorium. Exerts mass affect upon the pons and midbrain with significant displacement of the fourth ventricle.

Brain MRI with and without contrast s/p resection 3 mo later:
» Significant reduction in tumor size at cerebellopontine angle, now measuring 3.3 cm in maximum diameter. Continued compression of pons and cerebellum on right side with slight displacement of the fourth ventricle to the left of midline.
Vestibular Schwannoma
• Vestibular Schwannoma
• Meningioma
• Lipoma
• Epidermoid Inclusion cyst
