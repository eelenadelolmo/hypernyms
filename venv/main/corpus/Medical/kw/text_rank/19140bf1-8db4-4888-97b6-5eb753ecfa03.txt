Physical exam remarkable for abnormal facies and heart murmur in addition to jaundice.
Initial labs demonstrated elevated total bilirubin, AST, ALT, Alk Phos, and GGT.  The hepatic viral serology studies to include HBsAg, HBc-IgM, HAV- Igm, and HCV-Ab were all negative.
Multiple liver segment biopsies demonstrated paucity of intrahepatic biliary ducts and severe intrahepatic cholestasis confirmed by the AFIP.
Medical management
Ultrasound images demonstrated no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilitation to suggest an obstructive process i.e. biliary plug as the cause of jaundice.  Also no cystic structure near the gallbladder fossa was demonstrated, hence a choledocal cyst was ruled out as the cause of jaundice.  A small gallbladder was seen which did not help in the differential between hepatitis vs. biliary atresia.  No discernable extrahepatic biliary ducts were visualized on sonography.
On HIDA scan, radiotracer uptake by hepatocytes are adequate, but tracer never reaches the GI tract, even on 24-hour delayed imaging.
Alagille Syndrome
<li>neonatal hepatitis
<li>biliary atresia
<li>biliary obstruction i.e. plug
<li>choledocal cyst
2 month old boy presents with jaundice.
Ultrasonography is the initial imaging procedure in neonates with jaundice.  It can exclude the presence of a choledocal cyst or dilatation of the bile duct system from other causes of obstruction i.e. plug.  Also absence of a gallbladder is suggestive of biliary atresia however, 20% of patients with biliary atresia can have a small or rarely normal sized gallbladder.  The hepatic parenchyma and intrahepatic bile ducts usually appear normal in patients with biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis on sonography.
Once the differential diagnosis is narrowed to either biliary atresia vs neonatal hepatitis, a HIDA scan is the next study of choice.  The classically described scintigraphic appearance of neonatal hepatitis includes delayed uptake of radiotracer, slow clearance of blood pool radiotracer, but eventual excretion into the intestines.  On the other hand, in biliary atresia radiotracer uptake and clearance by hepatocytes are adequate but radiotracer never reaches the GI tract even at 24-hour delayed imaging.
In our case, the pathology lies within the intrahepatic biliary system with paucity of ducts as demonstrated on biopsy specimens.  Hence there was hepatocyte uptake but no excretion into the GI tract even at 24-hour imaging.
Hence this child met the diagnostic criteria for Alagille Syndrome as outlined in the Factoid, with abnormal facies, posterior ocular embryotoxon, and as demonstrated radiographically biliary stasis.
