External examination: Bilateral superotemporal firm, non-mobile subconjunctival masses with dilated vasculature; 3.5 mm right proptosis; full ductions, no diplopia

Internal examination: 2-3+ Nuclear sclerotic cataracts O.U. resulting in 20/40 – 20/50 best corrected VA; Choroidal nevus, unchanged for 15 years
May 2004:
Rx: Thalidomide
Shrinkage of orbital masses

March 2005:
Clinical examination: recurrence right orbit
Rx: Liposomal vincristine

November 2005:
No evidence of orbital disease
Biopsies of right orbital lobe of lacrimal gland and right subconjunctival mass.

Histopathology: Monomorphous centrocyte-like small lymphocytes, Cyclin D1 + [IHC]

Flow cytometry: CD5/CD20 +,CD10, CD23 –, FMC7 +

Cytogenetics: t(11;14)(q12-13.1;q32)
Mantle Cell Lymphoma
70-year-old female with ‘swollen eyelids’ and pain on abduction of right eye x 4 days.

Remote history of breast (age 46) and ovarian (age 28) cancer.

1999: Mantle cell lymphoma, periaortic lymph nodes/ileocecal valve/bone marrow: CHOP, Hyper CVAD. Autologous stem cell transplant 2002. No chemotherapy since January 2004
Recently defined category of B-cell lymphomas (3-10%).

Clinical features:
Late adulthood (median age 60)
Male predominance
Multifocal lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, bone marrow involvement
GI tract, Waldeyer’s ring also common extranodal sites
Median survival 3-5 years

Cell of origin: ‘mantle cell’ immediately surrounding follicle:
‘Centrocyte-like’ morphology
Proliferative in monotonous sheets of small cells with irregular nuclear contours, inconspicuous nucleoli
Hyalinized capillaries

Immunophenotype:
B-cell lymphocyte
CD19+, CD20+
Coexpression of CD5 (CD5+/CD20+)
DDx: SLL/CLL
Negative for:
CD23 (CLL/SLL CD5+,CD23+)
CD10 (FL CD5-,CD10+); (MALT CD5-,CD10-)
Cyclin D1+, FMC7+

Cytogenetics:
t(11;14) (q13;q32)
Juxtaposition of Ig heavy chain promoter and Cyclin D1 gene
Overexpression of Cyclin D1 gene, increased mRNA, gene product
Promotes phosphorylation of pRB, passage of cell into S phase

Ocular adnexal involvement:
Rare: eyelid, conjunctiva, orbit, lacrimal gland
3-5% of all ocular adnexal lymphomas
Demographics

9 orbital, 5 lacrimal gland, 5 eyelid
8 periocular presenting site
Unusual findings
