Pseudotumor  cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension)
• Optic neuritis

50 year old woman with headaches and blurred vision for 1 month.
Pseudotumor cerebri is increased intracranial pressure NOT caused by a mass lesion.  It may result from increased CSF presure with or without increased venous pressure.  Some cases, like this one, are associated with stenosis of the large dural sinuses.
