Patient is Afebrile
Abdomen is diffusely tender and distended. 
Creatinine is 4.0.
Lactate Pending.
Patient's Small Bowel Volvulus was corrected surgically.
Flat and Upright Abdominal Films reveal multiple dilated loops of small bowel with prominent air fluid levels. 

Axial CT images from the upper abdomen show normal orientation of the Superior Mesenteric Artery and Vein proximally with twisting and malposition of the Superior Mesenteric Artery distally (SMA to the left of the SMV proximally and to the right of the SMV distally). 

Axial CT images from the mid-lower abdomen show the mesenteric whorl sign (twisting of the mesentery) and associated mesenteric vessel engorgement. Bowel wall thickening suggests ischemia.

60 year old male with metastatic colorectal cancer and acute renal failure has acute onset abdominal pain and distension.
Small bowel obstruction is a common cause of abdominal pain inpatient and emergency room settings. Frequently plain flat and upright radiographs are the initial diagnostic study obtained to evaluate for obstruction. Radiographic signs of small bowel obstruction include small bowel dilatation (> 3 cm), differential (stair step pattern) air-fluid levels on upright films, and a paucity of distal bowel air. 

Once a small bowel obstruction is suggested on abdominal plain films, CT of the Abdomen and Pelvis is frequently used to better differentiate between the vast array of possible etiologies. Adhesions, incarcerated hernias, intussusception, midgut volvulus, inflammatory disease (Crohn’s Disease), and neoplasm (primary and metastasis) are all common mechanical causes of small bowel obstruction. By far the most common cause of mechanical small bowel obstruction is postoperative adhesion, accounting for nearly 75% of cases. 

Small bowel volvulus is reported to account for 3.5% to 6.2% of small bowel obstruction in the Western world, with a higher percentage in Asia and Africa (increased incidence of parasitic infection and associated increase in gut motility). Common causes of small bowel volvulus in the western world include adhesive bands, Meckel's diverticulum, internal hernia, obstruction neoplasm, and pregnancy. 

While conventional radiographs frequently reveal signs of small bowel obstruction in the patient with volvulus, CT is an excellent means through which to make the diagnosis. Findings include, twisting of the superior mesenteric artery and vein from their normal orientation proximally to a reversed orientation distally and the “mesenteric whorl sign” of the rotated mesentery. Bowel ischemia is suggested by bowel wall thickening and/or pneumatosis. 

Once diagnosed, treatment is surgical with bowel derotation, resection of infarcted bowel, and possibly bowel fixation.
