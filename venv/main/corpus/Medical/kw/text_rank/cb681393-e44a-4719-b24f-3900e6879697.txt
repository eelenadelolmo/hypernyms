Neurological examination reveals an abnormal gait and a positive left straight-leg raising sign
The patient will be treated conservatively. Any deterioration in his symptoms and the presence of progressive neurologic deficit will prompt surgical intervention.
Sagittal and axial MR imaging through lumbar spine and L5/S1 disk space demonstrate the presence of a large disc herniation which severely compresses the thecal sac and impinges on the left descending S1 nerve root.

A 32 y.o. man presents with acute low back pain radiating down his left leg.
This is a case of intervertebrak disk herniation in a typical extrusion pattern with good correlation of clinical and imaging findings. It should be noted that athough bulging disks and protrusions are common and poorly correlated with symptoms, extrusions are rare in asymptomatic patients (1â€“5% prevalence) and may be a good
 predictor of response to treatment and patient outcome.
