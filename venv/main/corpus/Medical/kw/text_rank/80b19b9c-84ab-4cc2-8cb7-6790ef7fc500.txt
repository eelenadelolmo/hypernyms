Woke up from sleep with tearing chest pain.
Important to evaluate is extension of dissection flap into aortic branch vessels and interference with vessel flow/perfusion.  This is from the level of the coronary arteries at the aortic root, the arch branch vessels or involving meseteric or renal arteries when the flap extends to the abdominal aorta.
