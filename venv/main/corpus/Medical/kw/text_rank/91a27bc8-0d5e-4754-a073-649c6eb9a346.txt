Gamekeeper's Thumb
Patient is a 24yo African American male who states that he fell with his thumb extended and now presents with a painful swollen right thumb.
Chronic injury of the ulnar collateral ligament among British gamekeepers, attributed to their method of killing wounded rabbits by a strong jerking pull while holding the animal's hyperextended neck between the index finger and thumb, led to the designation "gamekeeper's thumb". The term is now used loosely to denote both acute and chronic forms of ulnar collateral ligament instability. This ligament is subject to rupture or avulsion, often from a blow or fall upon the extended thumb, which may heal with displaceÂ¬ment and lengthening. The ligament may also gradually become lax after repeated abduction stresses.
