A previously healthy 23 y/o woman presents with a 4-month history of itchy skin, night sweats, and a 20-lb unintentional weight loss.
• Signs & Symptoms
Often asymptomatic 
Most common = painless lymphadenopathy
1/3 of pts present w/systemic symptoms
Fatigue, generalized pruritis, “B” symptoms [low-grade fever, night sweats, weight loss]
Mediastinal masses may also produce mass effects
