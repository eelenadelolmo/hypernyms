Bilaterally markedly enlarged, hyperechoic kidneys.  The amniotic fluid index was low normal.
Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease
ARPCKD - Nephronophthisis medullary-cystic disease complex

Bilateral replacement of the kidneys with masses such as bilateral mesoblastic nephromas or nephroblastomatosis - neither of which are classically hyperechoic
22y/o female with intra uterine pregnancy at 22weeks 5 days presented for follow up of routine 2nd trimester ultrasound done 3 weeks prior. The fetus at 19 weeks was seen to have appearance of minimal pelviectasis bilaterally as well as mild enlargement of both kidneys, and this follow up scan was scheduled.
Most in-utero diagnosed ARPCKD is in a setting of marked oligohydramnios.  As a result, there is lack of lung development and the fetus dies shortly after delivery.  As this fetus is demonstrating atleast some maintanance of renal function / urine production, preparation for this infants delivery has been more difficult as planning is needing to include preparations for dialysis and renal transplant.
