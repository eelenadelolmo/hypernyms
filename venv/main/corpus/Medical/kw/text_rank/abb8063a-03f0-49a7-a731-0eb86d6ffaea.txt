Normal physical exam. Urinalysis was consistent with gross hematuria, no crystals were visualized, WBC's were within normal limits.
Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor, TURBT, with biopsy of remaining bladder and prostatic urethra is normally sufficient for low-grade urothelial cancer. Adjuvant intravesicular therapy may be included for cases of high-grade urothelial cancer. BCG is most commonly used due to its favorable toxicity profile and its efficacy. Six months of BCG therapy is usually required to qualify as BCG resistant tumors. Alternatives for these tumors include adding mitomycin C, anthracyclines, and interferon.

High grade tumors are most likely to be muscle-invasive. MVAC is considered first line multi-agent chemotherapy.

Follow-up includes screening cystography for recurrence of disease which is not uncommon.
- Bilateral extrarenal pelves.
- No evidence of obstructing stones or stones in the bladder.  
- Abnormal layering of contrast material within the posterior aspect of the bladder concerning for clot vs mural mass.
- Metastatic disease with spread to bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes.
- Metastatic disease with spread to left lower lung lobe.
Urothelial Cancer
Bladder Cancer - mainly urothelial (transitional cell) cancer
BPH
Renal Stones
Cystitis
82 yo man with 2-month history of painless gross hematuria
This man had metastasis to his right acetabulum and right femur, right lower lung, and caudate lobe of the liver, with large infiltration of mediastinal and perihilar lymph nodes. Up to 45% of new urothelial cancers are high grade and half of those are already invasive. Metastases most commonly travel to lung and liver.

This patient's initial non-contrast CT  did not clearly show the mural mass as it is shown here. His enlarged prostate produced a mass effect indenting the contour of the posterior bladder wall. This highlights the need for careful evaluation of the bladder wall when it is opposed by the prostate and having a properly distended bladder to evaluate thickening of the trabeculated bladder wall.

This patient's hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy with mass effect on the pulmonary vessels aggravated this man's congestive heart failure with frequent admissions for exacerbations to rule out pulmonary embolisms.
