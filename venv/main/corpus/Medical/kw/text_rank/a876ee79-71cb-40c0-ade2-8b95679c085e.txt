Treatment (if any) depents upon the severity of the deformity.  Please see factoid for further details.
PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a pectus excavatum deformity of the anterior chest wall.  On the PA image the right heart border is not visable separate from the spine and sternum and the right hilum is therefore more visable that is typical. On the lateral image, the true nature of the sternal deformity (inward bowing of the inferior sternum) is visable at the inferior aspect of the anterior mediastinum.  No acute disease is present.
Pectus Excavatum
Pectus excavatum
Post surgical or traumatic change (only in the proper clinical setting)
