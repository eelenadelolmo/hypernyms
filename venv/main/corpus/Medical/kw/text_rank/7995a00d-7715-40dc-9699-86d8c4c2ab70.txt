Admission to Cardiology team and consultation with Vascular Surgery, Cardiothoracic Surgery and Infectious Disease. Long-term intravenous antibiotic therapy given new vegetations seen on replacement valve (images not included in this case) and evidence of septic embolization (renal infarcts and mycotic aneurysm). If patient were to clear infection, she could be a candidate for ligation with or without excision, aneurysmorrhaphy, revascularization with primary anatomosis, interposition or aortomesenteric bypass grafting (saphenous/native vs. synthetic), intimectomy with transposition, resection and bypass, transcatheter coil embolization or endoluminal stent grafting.

However, of note is patient's hospital course which required intensive care unit admission and care and during which her condition digressed after septic emboli led to a right middle cerebral artery stroke as well as left frontal lobe abscess.
CT Abdomen & Pelvis w/ IV contrast:
1) Right hepartic artery aneurysm 1.4 cm
2) Superior mesenteric artery aneurysm 1.8 cm w/ "halo"
3) Renal infarcts
4) Small abscess inferior to SMA

Visceral U/S (Duplex Doppler):
1) SMA aneurysm (aneurysmal flow)
2) Right hepatic artery aneurysm (aneurysmal flow)
3) Patent hepatic veins

CT Brain w/ and w/o IV contrast:
1) Hypoattenuation in right frontal and temporal lobes
2) Hypoattenuation in left frontal lobe w/ ring enhancement post contrast
3) Edema
4) Midline shift

MRI Brain T1W post-gadolinium, FLAIR, MRA:
1) Lack of flow-related signal throughout the course of the right middle cerebral artery with cut-off at the right internal carotid artery terminus
2) Edema/blood
3) Midline shift
Mycotic Aneurysm, Superior mesenteric artery
• Abscess
• Pancreatitis
• Mesenteric ischemia
• Colitis
• Gastric or duodenal ulcer (perforation)
• Hollow viscus perforation
• Appendicitis
• Visceral aneurysm
• Trauma
37 yo. woman w/ long-standing history of intravenous drug abuse and prior methicillin resistant staphyloccus aureus (MRSA) endocarditis and mitral valve destruction s/p porcine mitral valve replacement presents now w/ 3 week history of abdominal pain associated with food, nausea, no vomiting, intermittent bright red blood in stools. She has a history of non-compliance and incomplete treatment of her endocarditis due to against medical advice discharges.
The presenting signs and symptoms of SMA aneurysm are shared with much more common conditions. Given this non-specific presentation, a clinician should have high suspicion for SMA aneurysm in patients who are intravenous drug users, have chronic inflammatory conditions such as pancreatitis or a history of trauma and/or abdominal surgery. On physical exam a mobile, tender, pulsating abdominal mass can sometimes be seen - not so with our patient.  The clinical presentation of superior mesenteric artery aneurysms most commonly includes abdominal pain, post-prandial pain, and fever and researchers estimate 70-90% of patients are symptomatic at presentation. In our patient, only two of these non-specific clinical findings were seen but high suspicion of septic embolization due to her against medical advice history and incomplete antibiotic treatment course led to the use of imaging to provide a diagnosis. In general, because of the high morbidity and mortality related to SMA aneurysms, quick repair is indicated regardless of symptomatology (with only mild symptoms seen in our case). However, due to active septic embolization and infection which made surgical intervention high-risk and unlikely to lead to a beneficial outcome, this patient required medical management of her condition.
