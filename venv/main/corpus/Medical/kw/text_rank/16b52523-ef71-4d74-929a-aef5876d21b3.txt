Medulloblastomas are malignant primitive neuroectodermal tumors involving the cerebellum, and are the most common type of neoplasm to disseminate along the CSF pathways.

At least one report indicated that contrast-enhanced MR imaging is more sensitive (83%) than CSF cytologic analysis (60%–78%) in establishing the presence of CSF dissemination, even when multiple CSF samples were obtained.
