Fracture through C6-7 disc and superior C7 vertebral body.
Anterior flowing ostephytes C2 though C6 indicative of DISH.
Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis (DISH) with fracture through C6-C7 disk
Ankylosing Spondylitis
Paget Disease
68 year old man in MVA - drove car off of an embankment and hit a tree.
Key Features
--Flowing calcifications and ossifications along the anterolateral aspect of at least 4 contiguous vertebral bodies, with or without osteophytes
--Preservation of disk height in the involved areas and an absence of excessive disk disease
--Absence of bony ankylosis of facet joints and absence of sacroiliac erosion, sclerosis, or bony fusion, although narrowing and sclerosis of facet joints are acceptable.

Fractures are usually localized in the cervical spine and result from low energy impact in patients with DISH. 

The common potential complications of DISH in the cervical and thoracic spine include fractures, dysphagia, paraplegia, cervical and/or thoracic myelopathy, and dens spinal cord injury resulting from even minor trauma.

Risk factors for DISH are known to co-exist in the following conditions; diabetes mellitus type 2, obesity, and hyperuricaemia.
