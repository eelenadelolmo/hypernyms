Unremarkable
The patient is referred for neurosurgical consultation.
MR and CT imaging reveal the presence of an extra-axial mass lesion located in the right occipital area with a broad base of attachment with the tentorium cerebelli. The mass is partially calcified and is not exerting significant mass effect to the adjacent parenchyma. Following contrast administration the mass shows avid and homogeneous enhancement.
The above findings are consistent with the diagnosis of meningioma.
Meningioma
Meningioma (typical form)
Hemangiopericytoma
Tuberculosis
Sarcoidosis
Metastasis
Chloroma
Chondrosarcoma
Idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis
46-year old woman presents after a recent episode of transient loss of consciousness.
Initial NECT images could be confusing regarding to the origin of the mass (intra-axial vs extra-axial).  CECT imaging delineated to some degree the nature of the lesion and MR Imaging confirmed its benign , extra-axial location. When we study an intracranial mass it is of paramount importance to define whether the mass is extra-axial (outside brain parenchyma) or intra-axial(inside brain parenchyma) because the differential diagnosis is totally different.
