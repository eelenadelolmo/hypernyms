On examination: slight exophthalmos with downward displacement of the RE, lid ptosis, upper lid poorly mobile infiltrative lesion fixed to adjacent tissues, no circumscribed mass.
High-dose chemotherapy (VAD, vincristine, adriamycin, dexamethasone), followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, are the treatment modalities scheduled for this patient.

Followup Ocular Examination: decreased proptosis, improved motility
• A-B-scan: large, poorly defined, hypoechogenic tumour of the superior extraconal right orbit, with medium-low internal reflectivity. 

• Contrast-enhanced CT scan and MRI: bulky mass (30x21x34 mm) of the right orbit causing downward displacement of the globe and medial displacement of the superior rectus muscle and optic nerve. The lesion showed focal erosions of the orbital roof, without extension into the brain parenchyma. 

• Skull x-rays assessed changes in the bone structure with multiple punched-out lytic lesions, without sclerosis or periosteal reaction. 

Ocullar Pathology: Immunohistochemical stains positive for monoclonal light kappa chains, CD 138 (specific marker for plasma cells) proliferation index (Ki-67) 20%.
Non-secretory myeloma
• plasmocytoma
• metastatic carcinoma
• lymphoma and sarcoma.
62-year-old woman with a 5-month history of slowly progressive swelling and ptosis of the right upper eyelid. 

PMH: systemic hypertension 

VA: 20/25 in the affected eye 
       20/22 in the contralateral eye. 

IOP: 14 mmHg in both eyes. 
Ocular motility: restricted in all directions of gaze. 
Pupillary light reaction: preserved. 
Fundus examination: mild optic nerve head elevation and retinal venous congestion.

Malignant plasma cell tumours divided according to site of origin: multicentric, such as multiple myeloma (MM), or localized, originating at bone (solitary plasmocytoma of bone) or from soft tissue (extramedullary plasmocytoma). 
MM: 15% of all haematological malignancies, characterized by overproduction of a serum monoclonal protein, skeletal destruction with osteolytic lesions. 
Incidence: about 5.0 and about 4.2 per 100.000 person-years, in men and women respectively. 
Median age at diagnosis: 68 years in males and 70 in females. 

Risk factors: exposure to specific agents (pesticides, petroleum product, asbestos, rubber, plastic and wood products), high dose radiation, long-standing, chronic infection or chronic antigenic stimulation, viruses. 
The most common sites are in marrow areas of most active haematopoiesis, including, in order of frequency, the vertebrae, ribs, skull, pelvis, femur, clavicle and scapula.

Diagnosis: a constellation of radiological, clinical, laboratory and pathological findings are combined to provide diagnostic criteria for MM
Treatment: high-dose chemotherapy with haemopoietic stem-cell support, suitable for patients younger than 65 years (only about a third of all myeloma patients). 
MM is still an incurable neoplasm with a median survival of about 4-5 years obtained with high-dose chemotherapy. 
Its incidence shows a sharp increase of about 3% per year and the global mortality rate remains stable.  

About 4% of MM are non-secretory: plasma cells synthesise but do not secrete Ig molecules, leading to the absence of a M-component (paraprotein). Due to the lack of serum or urine monoclonal Ig, the diagnosis can be missed. 
In our patient, a non-secretory variant of MM was diagnosed: 
laboratory tests within the normal range,
bone marrow sample showed < 30% of plasma cells and 
lytic bone lesions observed only on the skull. 
The diagnosis could be made because of the orbital involvement, which was the first manifestation of the disease. 
 
As solitary plasmacytoma will progress to multiple myeloma, a doubt still remains about the onset of the orbital lesion. 
The pathological process could have started in the orbital wall as solitary plasmocytoma of the bone, although the orbital bone is very unusual as site of origin, 
or it could have developed from the orbital soft tissue as extramedullary plasmocytoma and have filled the orbital superior extraconal space. 
Such distinction is not possible now that the disease is systemic and the presence of a non-secretory form of myeloma makes the clinical picture rather confused. 
This case deserves attention for the uncommon modality of presentation of a rare disease, the non-secretory MM.
