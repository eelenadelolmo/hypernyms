Physical exam revealed tenderness of the right foot and lower extremity.  Laboratory values were within normal limits.
Patient refered back to primary care physician
3-phase bone scan using Tc99m-HDP demonstrates decreased blood flow and blood pool to the right foot.  Anterior and posterior delayed whole body planar images and spot views of the feet also show decreased radiotracer throughout the bones and soft tissues of the right lower leg and foot.
Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (also referred to as Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome).
Infection
Extremity immobilization
Vascular insufficiency
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD).
14-year old female landed incorrectly on a diving board approximately 7-weeks ago.  Patient has persistent pain in right heel.  Plain film radiographs taken shortly after the injury were negative for fracture.
A broad differential for abnormal bone scan in all three phases includes tumor, infection, trauma (fracture), extremity immobilization, acute arthritis, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy.  These entities will almost always show increased radiotracer accumulation.  In this patient, however, there was decreased radiotracer accumulation in all three phases in the symptomatic extremity.  This results in a much smaller differential and includes “cold” RSD, vascular insufficiency, and extremity immobilization.  Reflex sympathetic dystrophy complex consists of upper or lower extremity swelling, hyperesthesia, burning dysethesia, hyperhydrosis, and trophic changes to the skin and bone.  Reflex sympathetic dystrophy occurs in adults and children.  In children, RSD can appear "cold" on a three-phase bone scan.  A pattern of decreased radiotracer accumulation, both generalized and periarticular, can be seen as opposed to the more frequently seen increased radiotracer accumulation.

Plain film findings can sometimes include soft tissue swelling and patchy severe osteopenia.  This was not seen in this case.

A precipitating event can be identified in approximately 2/3 of patients.  This can include trauma, myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral nerve injuries, disc herniation, vasculitis or malignancy.  The patient in this case had a history of trauma to her right heel.

Treatment for RSD, "hot" or "cold", can include early mobilization, pain control, and application of heat or ice.  In some patients, a short course of high dose steroids has shown to be beneficial.
