The patient will be followed with plain film to verify resolution of the collapse, thus excluding a neoplastic or other cause.
Perfusion and ventilation images reveal absence of ventilation with normal perfusion to the right lower lobe, best appreciated on the right posterior oblique and right lateral views.  The linear photopenic defect in the region of the right major fissue is consistent with the pleural effusion seen on CT.  

Axial CT image with IV contrast confirms a right lower lobe consolidation.  A small amount of dependent atelectasis and small effusions are incidentally noted.
Lobar Consolidation; likely atelectasis given the lack of findings consistent with infection and the lack of known cancer.
Various causes of lobar consolidation, including infection, atelectasis, hemorrhage, and edema; with atelectasis most consistent with the clinical picture.
64 yo woman s/p lysis of adhesions with subsequent shortness of breath and desaturation.  Indeterminate CT PE/DVT study.
