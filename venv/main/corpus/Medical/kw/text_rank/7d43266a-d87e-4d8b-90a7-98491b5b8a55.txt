Meckel's Diverticulum with what are listed as Fecoliths
ectopic appendix with fecalith
enteric duplication cyst
RLQ pain presenting to ER to r/o appendicitis.
2 large fecaliths within larger than average-sized Meckel's diverticulum in a patient outside of the usual presenting age.  We wanted genetic testing on those "fecoliths"....they look a lot like pigs knuckles.  A case of Southern-Fried abdominal pain!
