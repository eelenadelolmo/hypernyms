There is marked colonic wall thickening and mucosal enhancement extending from the distal transverse colon through the rectum.  There is a large amount of pericolonic stranding as well as a small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.  There is no pneumatosis or portal venous gas.  No pneumoperitoneum. There are multiple non-dilated, fluid-filled loops of small bowel seen throughout the abdomen.

C. difficile colitis
• Infectious colitis
• Ischemic colitis
• Ulcerative colitis
• Crohn’s colitis
72 yo woman with 1 month history of abdominal pain and watery diarrhea, which has been getting gradually worse.  No hematochezia. Patient was recently admitted and treated for a multifocal pneumonia 1 month ago.  She presents today with fatigue, dehydration and continued diarrhea.
Patient developed gradually worsening abdominal pain and watery diarrhea soon after she was treated with cefuroxime and azithromycin for mutifocal pneumonia.  On abdominal/pelvic CT scan with IV contrast,  there was marked colonic wall thickening and mucosal enhancement extending from the distal transverse colon through the rectum.  There was a large amount of pericolonic stranding as well as a small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.  The celiac trunk, SMA and IMA were patent.  Patient’s history and imaging findings were highly indicative for  C. difficile colitis.  This was confirmed by C. difficle toxin assay from the stool culture.
