Myelomeningocele - open defect of spinal canal with myelomeningocele in sacral region noted at birth.
Close follow up with urology, and serial VCUG (every one to two years) and renal ultrasounds.  Patient is at risk for developing secondary vesicoureteral reflux and a small, high resistance bladder requiring surgical bladder augmentation.
Bladder with persistently funnel-shaped bladder neck during filling on VCUG with mild trabeculations of bladder wall.  

MRI demonstrates sacral myelomeningocele with sacral posterior midline defect and protruding spinal cord and meninges. Also the posterior fossa is small and the foramen magnum is widened consistent with Chiari II malformation.
