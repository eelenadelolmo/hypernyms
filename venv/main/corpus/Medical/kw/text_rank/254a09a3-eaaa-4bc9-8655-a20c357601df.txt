On physical examination she was in acute distress, with extreme dehydration and a subdued affect. Her vital signs revealed a temperature of 38 ?C, a pulse of 120 per minute, respirations of 20 per minute, and a palpable blood pressure of 120 mmHG. Signs of severe dehydration included orthostasis, dry mucous membranes, sunken eyes and tenting of the skin.  She had a few bilateral course rales, normal cardiac exam, mild diffuse abdominal tenderness, and no hepatosplenomegaly.  The remainder of her physical examination was normal.
Her rectal exam revealed guaiac positive stool.  Urinalysis showed white blood cells but negative nitrite; her hemoglobin was 10.5.  Wet prep of the stool revealed white blood cells with multiple Strongyloides stercoralis larvae; no parasite eggs were seen. Her blood smears were negative for malaria.
Treatment of S. stercoralis may consist of Albendazole 400 mg once daily for three days, Thiabendazole 22mg/kg/d twice a day for two days, or ivermectin 200 ?g/kg/d for one or two days.  In this case our patient was successfully treated with ivermectin.
Both microscopic evaluation and digital still images clearly revealed prominent genital primordium and a short buccal capsule characteristic of rhabditoid larvae of S. stercoralis
S. stercoralis
Strongyloides stercoralis

In comparison, the most common conflicting diagnosis of hookworm rhabditoid larvae has long buccal capsules and inconspicuous genital primordium.
A 25 year-old Bolivian woman was brought to the ship by a smaller boat, on the River Mamore.  She had diarrhea for one year with green stool increasing to 3-5 dark liquid stools per day over the past month. This was accompanied by malaise, dizziness, weakness and some nausea, with vomiting and anorexia.
Radiographs, histologic slides and photos of a patient can be digitized to help facilitate an accurate diagnosis and treatment program.  Photos can be taken with a digital camera and directly downloaded to a computer to avoid expensive film costs.  An area of pathology can be zoomed in on, such as a compound fracture, dislocation, deformity or skin lesion and emailed as an attachment to consulting specialists.  Digital cameras have been successfully used in assessment of extremity injuries for evaluation of replantation or revasularization of amputations and avulsions.  Digital cameras have also been used on aircraft carriers for distance learning while obtaining advice on a patient.  Digital cameras may additionally be used in combination with light microscopes to perform “field” digital microscopy.  As mentioned previously, several studies have proved their validity of traditional digital microscopy.  Can validity of “field” digital microscopy be inferred?   The two major pitfalls of accurate diagnostic interpretation for traditional digital microscopy are similar for digital microscopy.  These limitations are sited to be inadequate field chosen by photographer and clarity of image taken.   Both limitations are often functions of the  experience of the photographer and are not as easily controlled for in the field as they are in the laboratory.
