Lower back pain, otherwise unremarkable physical exam.
No further follow-up is required for Situs inversus totalis as it has only a small associated increased risk of cardiac abnormalities.  If Kartagener syndrome was present, patient would have a history of infertility and bronchiectasis on chest x-ray.
1. Pre-operative L-spine series:

The visualized osseous structures display normal mineralization. There are five non-rib-bearing lumbar vertebrae present.  The vertebral body and intervertebral disk space heights are maintained at all visualized levels.  Anterior osteophytes present at multiple levels, most significant at the L2 to L3 level.  There is extensive facet joint degenerative change at the L5 to S1 level, with moderate to severe foraminal stenosis.  There is no evident spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis.  No instability is demonstrated with flexion or extension views.  The visualized soft tissue structures are unremarkable.

2. Pre-operative Chest X-ray:

Total situs inversus is present. The lungs are well aerated and clear. There is no bronchiectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for size.  The pulmonary vessels are within normal limits for caliber.  The osseous structures are normal.

The patient is a 55-year-old male, requiring pre-operative evaluation before back surgery.
Patient proceeded to lumbar spine surgery as planned.  In retrospect, the reversed location of the liver and stomach can be seen on the lumbar spine plain film series.
