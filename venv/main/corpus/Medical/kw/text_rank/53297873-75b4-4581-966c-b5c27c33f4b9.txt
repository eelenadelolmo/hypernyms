Conventional myelogram (Fig. 1) and lumbar Myelo-CT sagittal (Fig. 2) and coronal (Fig. 3) reconstruction images delineate a lobulated mass, with low attenuation (–120 HU) of the distal 6 centimeters of the spinal cord involving the conus medullaris, which ended at upper aspect of L2. The filum terminale had a normal appearance with no evidence of lipoma or tethering, measuring 2mm at the level of L5-S1. Incidental finding of a Tarlov cyst is noted.
   Axial Image (Fig. 4) show the intramedullary location and a septated appearance.
Intramedullary lipoma of the spinal cord
Intramedullary Lesions:
» Neoplasm
• Ependymoma, Astrocytoma, Ganglioglioma
• Hemangioblastoma
» Other
• Syringohydromyelia
• Cord contusion
• Multiple Sclerosis
Patient is a 33-year-old white woman presenting with severe low back pain, left leg radiculopathy, and worsening urinary incontinence over the last 4 weeks.
A recent CT from an outside institution showed spina bifida occulta. She was referred for a CT-myelogram to assess for tethered-cord. An MR was contraindicated due to past medical history of idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis with an implanted intracardiac defibrillator.
