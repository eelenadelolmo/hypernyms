Unenhanced CT images show a region of low density in the inferior right lentiform nucleus.  More superiorly, the right lentiform nucleus is diffusely low in attenuation, demonstrating the so-called disapearing basal ganglia sign.  MRI shows increased intensity on FLAIR and T2 sequences with diffusion restriction, consistent with acute infarct.
