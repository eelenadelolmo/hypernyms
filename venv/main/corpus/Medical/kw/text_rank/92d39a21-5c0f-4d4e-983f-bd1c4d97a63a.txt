Pt presented in DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis). LFTs and amylase/lipase normal.
The diagnosis is confirmed by the unique imaging appearance.

Treatment of emphysematous cystitis involves early broad spectrum antibiotics, drainage of the bladder, and management of hyperglycemia if present. 

Prognosis in patients diagnosed and treated early in the disease process is usually good.The development of emphysematous ureteritis, nephritis, or adrenalitis portends a poor prognosis.

47 yo female with persistent N/V, epigastric pain;
Emphysematous cystitis is a rare entity (in 2001, a researcher reported his was only the 166th case in medical literature).  Typical patients are immunocompromised or elderly and debilitated, and 50% of cases are seen in  diabetics. 

Patients may present with anything from no symptoms to an acute abdomen.  Pneumaturia is rare, since the gas is within the bladder wall.  Prevalence in females is twice that in males.  Often associated with urinary stasis, and growth of gas forming organisms (most commonly E. coli, but others include Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci. Clostridium perfrigens, and Candida albicans).

Plain abdominal radiographs are generally sufficient to confirm the diagnosis. 

This disease is often not suspected until discovered on the abdominal radiograph.  Findings include curvilinear gas lucencies throughout the bladder, often described as a "cobblestone" or "beaded necklace" appearance.

Intraluminal gas may ascend the ureters and create an air pyelogram.  In rare cases where plain images are negative despite high clinical suspicion, CT may show intramural bladder gas (as in this case).
