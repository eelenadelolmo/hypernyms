Right Knee (+) Lachman’s, (+) effusion, (+) ecchymosis, (+) quadriceps atrophy, (-) joint line tenderness, (+) TTP at lateral/medial femoral condyle, (+) TTP MPFL, ROM 5 – 95 degrees, 4mm difference in anterior tibial translation compared to left knee.
Patient prescribed knee brace to limit range of motion. Pain and inflammation controlled with Vioxx 25mg QD. Physical therapy consult to increase quadriceps strength.  Patient is currently awaiting post-MRI follow-up for surgical evaluation.
: x-ray- normal, MRI- Full thickness injury to the mid portion of the anterior cruciate ligament. Medial collateral ligament partial tear of anterior proximal fibers. Partial tear of the posterior cruciate ligament at the tibial attachment. Lateral tibial plateau impaction fracture. Bone marrow edema at the lateral femoral condyle. Tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus.
Full thickness injury to the mid portion of the anterior cruciate ligament. Medial collateral ligament tear of anterior proximal fibers. Partial tear of the posterior cruciate ligament at the tibial attachment. Lateral tibial plateau impaction fracture. Bone marrow edema at the lateral femoral condyle. Tear involving the posterior horn of the medial meniscus.
ACL injury, PCL injury, MCL injury, medial meniscus injury, fracture of the distal femur or proximal tibia.Other injuries to consider – osteochondral fracture, patellar dislocation, knee dislocation.
27 YO female presents with 2 week history of right knee pain. Patient reports wrestling and her opponent falling on her knee. She felt a “pop” with immediate pain and swelling. She also reports decreased range of motion and feeling of instability upon standing.
