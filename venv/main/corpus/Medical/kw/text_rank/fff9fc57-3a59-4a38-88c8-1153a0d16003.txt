AThere is a constricting lesion present in the pylorus with proximal distension of an atonic stomach full of a large number of retained pills and fluid.  A nasogastric tube is in place within the stomach.

There are surgical clips from her prior cholecystectomy.

Surgeries: Cholecystectomy, R knee replacement x 2 (infected)
Discussion: Gastric Outlet Obstruction (GOO) in this pt was due to a large ulcer, which could be from peptic ulcer disease (PUD), gastroduodenal Crohn's, or malignancy.   PUD is the most prevalent disorder, however, due to PPIs and antibiotics for H. Pylori, it accounts for only 2% of GOO.   In contrast, malignancy currently accounts for 50-80% of GOO in the U.S. population and due to the pt's age and underlying Crohn's, it must be ruled out as a cause.  Finally, 5% of patients with Crohn's disease develop gastroduodenal Crohn's, which frequently presents like PUD with GOO.  However, GD Crohn's usually traverses the pylorus to involve both the antrum of the stomach and the proximal duodenum.  Tissue biopsy will need to be done to confirm the exact etiology.
