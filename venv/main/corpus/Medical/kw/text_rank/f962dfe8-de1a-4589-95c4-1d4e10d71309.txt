The patient has a large right scalp fluid collection with surrounding edema and contrast enhancement highly suspicious for infection. Underlying scalp fluid collection. There is significant bone marrow edema and enhancement of the right frontal bone - consistent with osteomyelitis. Also, there is enhancement of the right frontal high convexity, which is suspicious for meningeal involvement of the infection. 

Intracranially, there is no abnormality seen and no  intracranial abscess identified. No evidence of hemorrhage. The ventricles, cisternal spaces and sulci are all within normal limits. No mass or mass effect identified. No midline shift.
