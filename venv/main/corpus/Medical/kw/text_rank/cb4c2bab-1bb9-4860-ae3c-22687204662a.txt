No abnormalities.
None.
A single benign appearing intramammary lymph node is present in each mammogram.  All clearly demonstrate the classic findings of a benign intramammary lymph node:  (1) radiolucent fatty hilum (2) sharply defined (3) round or oval shaped (4) low-moderate density (5) <= 1 cm length (6) surrounded by breast parenchyma
Intramammary Lymph Node.  Documented stability and characteristic appearance.
Normal axillary lymph node
Malignant lymph node
Other benign, well-circumscribed lesions of the breast: fibroadenoma, hamartoma, cyst
Malignant solid mass
Various routine screening mammograms from several different asymptomatic patients.
Familiarity with the appearance of breast lymph nodes has diagnositic and therapeutic importance.  Tumor extension to a lymph node may change its appearance and indicate metastatic potential of a primary breast cancer.  Malignant lymph nodes are typically excised or treated with radiation, althought treatment doesn't appear to improve overall survival.  Intranodal calcifications, increased size or density, altered shape and development of spiculations are all findings associated with malignancy in a breast lymph node.  Careful confirmation of the stable size, shape, density and calcifications are essential to diagnosing benign intramammary lymph node at each examination.  Changes should be further examined with magnification and/or spot compression views and ultrasound if necessary.
