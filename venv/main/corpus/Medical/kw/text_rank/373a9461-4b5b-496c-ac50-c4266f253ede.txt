Texto: 
The patient is a well appearing, alert, oriented, afebrile, pleasant male in no acute distress.  His left leg is modeled and edematous with two well healed skin grafts at the proximal medial and distal medial aspects.  There are numerous skin to erythematous colored nodules on all aspects of the left lower leg.  The nodules are 1-4 cm in diameter and tender to palpation.

Initially, no labs were taken.
Systemic evaluation was done to measure the extent of the disease with MRI and PET scans.  MRI of the left lower extremity, without contrast, showed multiple cutaneous and subcutaneous enhancing nodules.  The largest nodule was at the anteromedial aspect of the proximal leg superficial to the myocutaneous flap (with infiltration) measuring 1.3 x 3.3 x 3.3 cm (anterior-posterior x transverse x craniocaudal).  Numerous additional small areas of nodular enhancement were identified within the cutaneous tissues inferiorly, circumferentially, and with a conglomeration of nodular lesions posterolaterally.  PET imaging showed multiple soft tissue active foci in the left lower extremity consistent with malignancy.   The patient underwent a short course of chemotherapy which was stopped due to patient intolerance.  Wide excision with soft tissue coverage are now planned with the possibility of needing a below the knee amputation.
A punch biopsy specimen from nodules on the left proximal medial leg and left distal posterior leg demonstrated spindled cells with hyperchromatic irregular nuclei and variable pleomorphism.  They were isolated to the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, with a multinodular growth pattern and a prominent myxoid stroma.  Scattered multinucleated cells were also present as were perivascular condensation of the tumor cells without vascular invasion.  Perineural invasion was also present.
Low grade myxofibrosarcoma
This patient is  a 76 year-old man with a past medical history significant for high grade malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH).  He presented with multiple gradually enlarging painful nodules in the left leg.  These lesions are located diffusely on the left lower leg and have been slowly enlarging as well as increasing in number over the past few months.  Aside from these lesions, the patient has no complaints and is otherwise feeling healthy.  Twice in the past three years the patient has been treated with wide excisions and radiation therapy for primary and recurrent high grade MFH.  These tumors also presented as slow growing tender erythematous nodules and were located in the left proximal thigh, left proximal medial leg, and left distal medial leg.
