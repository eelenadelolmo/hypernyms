Palpable soft tissue mass over the lateral aspect of the mid-lower left leg.

No laboratory data available.
Treatment for this patient is pending, but can consist of conservative management, or alternatively surgical excision.
Ill-defined mass on pre-gad T1 which is isointense to muscle and containg small distrubited foci of increased signal, representating fat.  Strong enhancement with a vascular pattern on post-gad sequences.

On T2 sequences, the mass is intensely high signal intensity centrally, with a lobulated appearance. The areas of fat are become low signal intensity with the fat-saturation.  Additional low signal intensity areas represent hemosiderin (sparse in this case). The vascular nature of this mass is also shown on this sequence. There is no involvement of underlying bone.
Hemangioma, soft-tissue
Hemangioma
Hemangiopericytoma
Arteriovenous Malformation
Low grade angiosarcoma
42yo male with h/o painful mass on left lower leg.  Mass has been getting more bothersome. PMHx significant only for newly-diagnosed prostate cancer.
This case presents typical features of soft-tissue hemangioma.  The diagnosis is differentiated by the characteristic presence of fat within the lesion.  Without the presence of fat, these imaging features would be consistent with hemangiopericytoma, although a larger mass would typically be present, and would likely involve bone. Hemangioma can also involve bone, however this one does not. Findings would also be consistent with a small, low grade angiosarcoma.

This case falls slightly outside of the typical age distribution of 20-40 yrs, as well as typical sex, which is female.
