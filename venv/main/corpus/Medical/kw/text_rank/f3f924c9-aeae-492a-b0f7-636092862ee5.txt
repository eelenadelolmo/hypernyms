Non-contrast axial CT image demonstrates a well-circumscribed smoothly marginated, heterogeneous 3.5 x 3.2 cm mass arising from the left adrenal gland.  There are areas within the mass that are low density and measure 5 HU.   50 seconds postcontrast axial CT image demonstrates the lesion to enhance heterogeneously, with areas within the mass measuring 113 HU.  15-minute delay postcontrast axial CT image demonstrates the lesion to enhance heterogeneously, with areas within the mass measuring 35 HU.  The percentage enhancement washout was determined to be 72% consistent with a benign adrenal adenoma.
