Limited plain film of the upright abdomen shows thickened haustra of the transverse colon.

Selected axial, oral and IV contrast enhanced, images show substantially thickened colonic bowel wall with preservation of, but thickened, haustra, comprising the entire colon.  Small bowel is not affected. Mild pericolonic fat stranding is present.

78yo male presents to ED with a three week history of persistent diarrhea and new onset of diffuse abdominal pain and distension.  The patient was seen one month ago by his primary care provider and treated for sinusitis.
Pseudomembranous colitis is a toxin induced inflammatory infection of the colon caused overgrowth of Clostridium difficile, secondary to antibiotic use.  Historically associated with clindamycin, this entity can occur subsequent to almost any antibiotic, as well as, steroids and chemotherapeutic drugs. Symptoms begin as early as one day after starting the medication and as late as six weeks after cessation.  Common presentations include low fevers, leukocytosis, diffuse abdominal pain, and of course diarrhea.  The diarrhea is typically non-bloody and should not contain mucous.  Diagnosis is made with fecal testing for toxin by ELISA and latex agglutination for C. difficile.  
Abnormal plain film findings are seen in 40% of patients and include thumbprinting, ileus, thickened haustra, and megacolon.
CT findings show a substantially thickened (typically >15mm) colonic wall with preserved haustra. Findings occur first distally in the rectum and then progress proximally.  Contrast between thickened haustra is described as the accordion sign, but is not specific.  The terminal ileum is typically not affected.  Ascites and pericolonic fat stranding are associated with this disease process.
