Acute cholecystitis is associated with cholelithiasis in about 90-95% of the cases.  Acalculous cholecystitis is typically seen in the setting of ICU patients with chronic severe disease.   However, a small group of patients present with acalculous cholecystitis from the outpatient setting.  This group  includes children and patients who have a history of prolong fasting, diabetes or opioid use.  Cholecystitis is rare in children but up to 50% of the cases are of acalculous.  Biliary stasis, ischemia, inflammation and trauma are thought to contribute to these cases.
