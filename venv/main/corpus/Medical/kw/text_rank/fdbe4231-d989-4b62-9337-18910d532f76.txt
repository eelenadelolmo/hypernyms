Patient is scheduled for surgery to release soft tissues around left vertebral artery at C1-2 level
Diagnostic angiogram:
1. Head in neutral position.  Angiogram demonstrates normal caliber of the left vertebral artery.
2. Head in rotated position to the right (patient supine  on the table with a small pad under his head). Angiogram demonstrates slight irregularity of the vessel distal to exit from f. transversarium at C1-2 level.
3. Head is hyperextended and rotated to the right to a greater degree than in #2. Angiogram demonstrates significant narrowing of the vertebral artery at C1-2 level with slowing of contrast passage.

MRI/MRA demonstrates occlusion of the right vertebral artery.
Bow Hunter's syndrome
58 year old male with one year history of feeling dizzy when turning his head to the right.  His symptoms resolve each time once he returns his head to neutral position.  No symptoms when the head is turned to the left or hyperextended.
In our case, patient presented with history of dizziness once he turns his head to the right.  MRA demonstrated severely stenotic right verterbral artery.  Diagnostic arterigram of the left artery was performed in several positions until patients symptoms were reproduced.  Since the patient was placed supine on the table, his head had to be hyperextended and significantly rotated to the right.  He experienced dizziness and the angiogram demonstrated narrowing of both horizontal segments of the loop of the left vertebral just distal to foramen transversarium at the C1-2 level.  His symptoms promptly resolved once his head was returned to a neutral position.
