Laboratory work remarkable for declining BUN and creatinine.
Surgical repair of the pseudoaneurysm.
Noncontrast axial CT through the level of the common femoral arteries demonstrates a rounded soft tissue density in the region of the common femoral artery on the right.  There is small crescent of calcification in the periphery of the soft tissue density and associated fat stranding and inflammatory changes in the surroundign soft tissues.  CT performed 11-days post catherization demonstrates mild increase in size of the soft tissue density.

Color Doppler ultrasound performed in the region of the catherization puncture site and corresponding to the soft tissue density as seen on CT demonstrates bidirectional color flow in a hypoehcoic mass.  Flow can be seen within a short neck which extends between the mass and the common femoral artery.
Femoral Artery Pseudoaneurysm

Arterial pseudoaneurysm
88-year-old female status post renal artery stent placement.  
Catherization was performed through the right femoral artery.  Patient now complains of right groin pain.
A femoral artery pseudoaneurysm is a known complication resulting from catherization procedures.  In this case, the patient underwent a right-sided percutaneous catherization for renal artery stent placement.  Pseudoaneurysms can be readily identified on color Doppler ultrasound by the to and fro or "yin-yang" appearance of blood flow in a hypoechoic mass.

Pseudoaneurysms are not true aneurysms and therefore do not have a complete arterial wall surrounding them.  They are a localized rupture of the artery contained by a fibrous capsule and the surrounding soft tissues.  Complications that can result from pseudoaneurysm formation include bleeding, pain, neuropathy, infection, and sometimes rupture.  The patient in this case was evaluated because of increasing right groin pain.

Treatment of pseudoaneurysms includes direct surgical repair, as in this case.  Alternativley thrombin can be injected into the pseudoaneurysm under ultrasound guidance.  Another intervention includes ultrasound-guided compression repair.
