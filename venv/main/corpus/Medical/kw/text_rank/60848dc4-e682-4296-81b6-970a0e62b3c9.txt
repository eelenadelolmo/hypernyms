"Gullwing" deformities secondary to central erosions are scattered throughout the interphalangeal joints, most prominent at the ring finger DIP and the middle finger PIP. Typical osteoarthritic findings include joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophytosis seen in the distal greater than the proximal interphalangeal joints, with prominent carpometacarpal degenerative changes at the base of the thumb.
