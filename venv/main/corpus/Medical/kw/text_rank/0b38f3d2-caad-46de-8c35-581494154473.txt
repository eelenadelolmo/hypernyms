Right radical nephroureterectomy/cystoprostatectomy with ileal conduit
Bilateral nephrolithiasis with a stone in the proximal right ureter causing obstruction of the right collecting system.  Surrounding enhancing soft tissue density around this stone suggestive of an adjacent mass suspicious for an upper tract lesion.

UTI
70 year old male with history of high grade T1 papillary urothelial carcinoma in 2008 currently undergoing BCG therapy now with new onset gross hematuria and right sided flank pain. Denies fevers, chills, dysuria or other GU symptoms.
Hematuria work-up consists of three (3) studies: 1. Urine cytology, 2. CT abdomen/pelvis with/without contrast (CT Renal IVP, Triple phase CT, Hematuria protocol CT), and 3. Cystoscopy. 

Epidemiology of TCC:
 - Accounts for ~90% of all GU cancers
 - Can be multifocal and bilateral
 - AA > Caucasian = Hispanic = Native Americans > Asians
 - Male:Female  2:1
 - Peak incidence 60-70 years, rarely before 40
 - Bladder >> upper urinary tract
 - Risk Factors: smoking, exposure to numerous chemical compounds (aniline dyes, PVC), chemotherapy, chronic bacterial or schistosomiasis GU infection and stones (usually causes SCC)
