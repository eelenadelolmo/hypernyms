Patient 1: Unenhanced axial CT image at the level of the left ventricle demonstrates visualization of the interventricular septum.  The CT attenuation of blood in the lumen of the left ventricle measures 31 HU, suggesting anemia.  

Patient 2: Unenhanced axial CT image at the level of the left ventricle demonstrates visualization of the interventricular septum.  The CT attenuation of blood in the lumen of the left ventricle measures 34 HU, suggesting anemia.
