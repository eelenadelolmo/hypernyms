VS: HR=108, RR=20  O2 sat=94% on 2L NC.
PE: Chest- Clear to Auscultation
Treatment: Anticoagulation
Follow-up:  Some advocate a 3-4 month post-treatment V/Q scan to monitor treatment and basically to re-establish a baseline (in case of recurrent PE).
CXR (PA/Lat):  unremarkable

Ventilation/Perfusion Scintigraphy:
-Ventilation: normal (*Homogeneous distribution on wash-in phase and equilibrium phase with full lung outline *Progressive, uniform decrease in activity with no activity seen on last wash-out image) 
	
-Perfusion:  abnormal (*Large segmental mismatched perfusion defects in RLL basal segments and RML lateral segment)

*High probability V/Q scan: (2 or more mismatched large perfusion defects).
Pulmonary embolism
Differential Diagnosis (V/Q mismatch)
**1)Acute pulmonary embolism

2)Chronic pulmonary embolism (common cause of false+, patient had no prior history)

3)Other embolic causes
   -septic emboli(no signs of infection)
   -fat embolism(unlikely, seen with long bone fracture, no CNS sx/rash/ARDS picture)
28 y/o female S/P left total hip replacement with tachycardia, SOB.
Given the risk factors and clinical picture in this case, the patient had a high clinical probability for PE (scoring system used in article referenced below).

High clinical probability and high probability V/Q scan together provide high positive predictive value (95+%) for PE.  Therefore, diagnosis can be confirmed without further work-up and the patient can be confidently treated (anticoagulation).

Likewise, low clinical probability and normal V/Q scan have equal confidence in excluding PE.  

The difficulty is with low-probability and indeterminate V/Q probabilities (with intermediate or high clinical probability).  These patient's need further evaluation (CT Angio--often performed in leiu of V/Q or pulmonary angiography--role is becoming less clear) since PE has not been confidently confirmed or excluded.
