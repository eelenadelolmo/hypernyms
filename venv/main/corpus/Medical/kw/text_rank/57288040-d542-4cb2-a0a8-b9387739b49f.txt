The patient is currently being treated with Lovenox 1mg/kg bid and Eliquis 5mg bid and should continue with long-term anticoagulation therapy due to her history of VTE as well as continued risk factors. She continues to follow-up with her primary care doctor and is scheduled to undergo another duplex doppler compression ultrasound to reassess the DVT due to continued symptomatology.  The patient should be monitored for symptoms of recurrent PE and post-thrombotic syndrome.

In addition, the patient continues to have symptoms of back, neck and shoulder pain that began due to her MVA. Now that the patient has had MRIs of the cervical spine and lumbar spine, it has been determined that further surgical intervention is not required. Based on the physical exam and imaging, the patient has been recommended to pursue flexion distraction therapy and chiropractic manipulation therapy, with the plan to gradually increase quantum exercise to strengthen her lower back and core. In the absence of compressive lesions at the nerve root level as demonstrated by MRI imaging it is doubtful that EMG studies will be of much positive value in evaluating her condition.  The patient is also encouraged to increase ambulation throughout the day, as possible.
Table 1. Lower Extremity Evaluation: On circumferential mensuration the patient's affected right thigh measured 7cm larger than her left thigh, due to residual edema and inflammation of the right lower extremity from the occlusion. Her range of motion was also limited more significantly on the right than the left, with pain radiating to the foot.

Table 12. Commonly recognized risk factors for Venous Thromboembolism present in the patient. At the time of diagnosis with DVT and PE, the patient had numerous well recognized risk factors for VTE, most notably prior history of VTEs, recent hospitalization involving surgery, pregnancy, and postural limitations.
Deep vein thrombosis resulting in a pulmonary embolism.
When considering a diagnosis, it is critical to remember the patient’s pertinent history, most specifically, her recent history of pregnancy, motor vehicle accident resulting in injury, and personal history of thrombosis. 

In a postpartum woman with shortness of breath and edema, especially those with a history of venous thromboembolisms, pulmonary embolism must be considered. It is also important to consider preeclampsia, a pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorder that can present before during or after delivery, that can result in potentially life-threatening end-organ damage (1). Another rare, but life-threatening, disorder is peripartum cardiomyopathy, which can present as heart failure up to 5 months after delivery (2). In addition, in women who present more acutely after delivery, the possibility of an amniotic fluid or air embolism should also be considered. In a patient that had no additional symptoms and risk factors, normal residual physiologic changes after pregnancy should be considered. 

Once imaging has been performed and a radiolucency or filling defect is identified, as was the case with this patient, an acute embolism must be differentiated from a chronic embolism. Acute emboli tend to make acute angles and the vessel is more likely to be enlarged, whereas chronic emboli tend to be at the periphery of the vessel, forming an obtuse angle (3,4). Calcification is also more likely to be seen in a chronic embolism (3).
The patient is a 33 year old African American woman who was in a motor vehicle accident in 2016, when she was two and half months pregnant. The patient was a front seat passenger wearing a seat belt when the vehicle she was in was struck on the back passenger side. On impact, the patient was pushed forward with her head turned to the right. She did not strike her head, lose consciousness, or experience any bleeding. Although an ambulance came to the scene, she did not go to the hospital at that time; however, she later presented to a local hospital where she was examined, an ultrasound was performed that confirmed her viable pregnancy with estimated gestational age of 9 weeks and 5 days, and she was released. 

She first presented to this office one week after the accident with complaints of pain in her neck that radiates to her left shoulder, as well as pain in her mid back and low back. Since the accident, she had not been able to lie in a fully reclined position, and had been sleeping in a recliner chair.  She denied any pain in her lower extremities. Although she reported that she received a prescription for an anticoagulant, she was not taking any at that time. Imaging was not obtained due to her pregnancy. 

Eight months later, the patient returned for evaluation. She reports that she delivered her baby via c-section about 4 months prior, after hospitalization for preeclampsia. She reports that she began to experience worsening back pain in the same region as the pain from her accident, but attributed it to the epidural. She was placed on an anticoagulant after the delivery. This hospitalization was also the first time she had been in a fully recumbent position since the car accident. After her release from the hospital, her back pain worsened to the point where should could not lie on either of her sides. In addition, she developed right leg pain to the point where she felt she could not walk because she did not feel her leg could support her body. Two months ago she began experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath, which prompted her to return to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism in her left lung resulting from a deep venous thrombosis in her right leg. The patient reports being informed that, due to her history, she should have been on a higher dose of anticoagulant therapy. 

The patient returned to the office for follow-up again, 13 months after the accident. She continues to have back pain that radiates down both legs to her feet. In addition, she continues to experience severe pain and swelling in her right leg that gets worse throughout the day.  She also reports neck pain that radiates to her right shoulder, with limited mobility in the right shoulder. She has not been able to return to work since the time of the accident. 

Past Medical History
The patient reports that she was also in a car accident in 2008, during her first pregnancy, where she was also a restrained front seat passenger. At that time, she sustained an injury to her lower back, and received cortisone injections. She reports that she made a full recovery. 

In addition, the patient has a history of DVTs. The first occurred in 2002 and was determined to be related to her use of a hormonal birth control pill. The second occurred in 2008, after her first pregnancy. Neither of these events resulted in a pulmonary embolism. 

The patient has no significant family history and has not been diagnosed with any primary hypercoagulable states.

This patient initially presented due to neck, shoulder and back pain after a motor vehicle accident (MVA) which had resulted in difficulty ambulating, due to pain, and difficulty sleeping, especially due to her inability to lay in a fully recumbent position. The patient was pregnant at the time of the accident. During her hospitalization for preeclampsia, and subsequent delivery of her baby via cesarean section, she was further immobilization, and laid fully recumbent for the first time since the MVA. At the time of discharge, she was experiencing back and lower extremity pain, which have continued. Approximately 1.5 months after delivery, she developed shortness of breath and chest pain which led her to seek medical care and she was diagnosed with a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient had a number of well established risk factors for venous thromboembolisms (VTEs), described below, that are important to consider in understanding this development (Table 2). 

The development of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is attributed to three main factors, known as Virchow’s Triad: endothelial cell injury, hypercoagulability, and stasis of blood flow (5). Most commonly, VTEs occur in the deep veins of the lower extremity, and can often present as either an isolated DVT or with a related PE, which is attributed to a portion of the thromboembolism breaking off from the original location, entering the circulatory system, and then lodging into an artery of pulmonary system. (5)

There are a number of well-established factors that contribute to a hypercoagulable state and the development of venous thromboemboli, both inherited, and acquired, and the greater the number of risk factors, the more likely an individual is to develop a VTE (6,7).

Pregnancy and the postpartum period are considered a hypercoagulable state due to the presence of all 3 of Virchow’s factors. During pregnancy, women experience an increase in total blood volume, as well as an increase in hormones associated with smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation, which causes increased pooling in the lower extremities (1). Furthermore, as the uterus enlarges, it compresses the inferior vena cava, causing stasis and further pooling in the lower extremities (1). The body also begins to increase anticoagulation factors, and decrease the response to anticoagulation factors, in preparation for the bleeding associated with delivery (1,7). In pregnant women, the incidence of VTE is 5 to 10 fold that of comparable non-pregnant women (8). This risk is increased further, reports ranging from 15 to 35 fold, during the postpartum period with the highest risk occurring between postpartum weeks 3-6 (8). 

In addition, contributing risk factors from this this patient MVA must also be considered. Studies have shown that individuals who experience trauma are at an increased risk of VTE. Individuals with fractures to the pelvis, hip, femur and tibia are at the highest risk; in fact, over 60% of individuals with a pelvic or lower extremity injury developed a DVT (6,9). And, up to 40% of individuals who had injuries to other areas, including those in the chest, abdomen, even the face, were found to have VTEs (6,9). Even those individuals with minor injuries resulting from trauma are at 3-5 times higher risk of DVT than the general population, most strongly for the following 3-4 weeks, but for as long as 10 weeks (10). 

In addition, the patient’s mobility was limited after the MVA. Most notably, she was unable to lay fully recumbent and remained in a seated position during the majority of her pregnancy, including during sleep. Postural limitations and postural stasis have been repeatedly associated with increased health risks, especially VTE. For example, the development of VTE was originally associated with hospital stays, where patients were restricted to bed rest. Later, the relationship between prolonged sitting due to air travel, and then sedentary work or prolonged computer related sitting have been well linked with an increased risk of VTE (11-16). A 2013 assessment of individuals with clinically diagnosed Parkinson’s disease, which is known to cause postural changes and bradykinesia, found that postural abnormalities, including bent knees, bent spine, and wheelchair use, were the only factors to be significantly independently associated with the presence of DVT (17).  Most recently, a study on health care workers, found that prolonged standing is also associated with DVT, as well as venous insufficiency (18).

Finally, the greatest risk factor for a VTE is an individual’s personal history of VTE (6,7,11). Individuals with a history of VTE are almost 8 times as likely to have another episode when in a high risk situation, such as trauma or surgery, than those who have not had a prior episode (6,7,11). Any occurrence of a venous thromboemboli leads to stretching and damage that can remain after the clot has resolved, known as chronic venous insufficiency, further increasing risk for future clotting. Those with chronic risk factors are more likely to have a recurrence than those with transient risk factors (6,7,11). The main risk factor identified during her first event, oral contraception use, was transient. However, the following two occurrences were also in a high estrogen state, pregnancy. 

This patient continues to have risk factors associated with VTE, and steps should be taken to address her remaining modifiable risk factors, including further assessment of her back pain in order to determine the best management to improve her mobility. Furthermore, the risks associated with VTEs do not end with diagnosis and treatment. Patients should continue to be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of recurrent emboli as well as post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS): chronic pain, edema, and skin changes, including ulcers, in the affected limb (19, 20). PTS, a form of chronic venous insufficiency resulting from DVTs,  occurs in more than one-third of women who have a DVT, especially those who have had a previous DVT, are obese, and are still having symptoms more than one month after the event, such as the patient described here (19, 20). Patients at increased risk for PTS should continue to use compression therapy, leg elevation, and use of venoactive medications to help with venous return (19, 20).

In this case the patient has been non-compliant with care.  This and the initial pregnancy caused a postponement of MRI evaluation.  It is understood that MRI is not actually contraindicated in pregnancy but to err on the side of caution, such was delayed until after delivery.  She is currently under chiropractic care and such is felt to be useful in further evaluating and treating her condition.  Myofascial(21, 22, 23, 24) and myofascial/ligament/bone related pain that may have a sclerotomal pain presentation (25) have radiating pain simulating radiculopathy from which such  needs to be differentiated. In this case, there is no MRI evidence to suggested neural compression at the root level.  Myofascial pain syndromes can be both diagnosed and treated by spray and stretch, trigger point therapy (Nimmo), instrument assisted soft tissue manipulation, soft tissue decompression therapy and trigger point injections.  Sclerotomal pain syndromes may respond to prolotherapy (26).   Pelvic congestion syndrome (27) can cause pelvic and lower extremities symptoms and is diagnosed by US and CT.
