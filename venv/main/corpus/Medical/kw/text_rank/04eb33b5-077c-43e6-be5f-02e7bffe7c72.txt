Physical exam showed no remarkable findings. Laboratory results showed no elevation of cardiac enzymes. No remarkable lab results were ascertained.

Echocardiogram results withheld until discussion:
Repair of anomalous left coronary from the main pulmonary artery by excision of ostium of coronary and re-implantation in the aortic root with reconstruction.

Echocardiogram on discharge revealed trivial posterior pericardial effusion, minimal flow acceleration across the proximal main pulmonary artery.  No pulmonary regurgitation, mild LVH and normal biventricular systolic function.
Evaluation of the cardiac anatomy demonstrates levocardia. 

1.  Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from main pulmonary artery (ALCAPA). There is 11 mm distance between the origin of the left main coronary artery and the left coronary sinus.  Retrograde flow is demonstrated through the left coronary arterial system via differential opacification of blood above and below the pulmonic valve. No frank fistulas are identified.  More specifically, any fistulas which may be present would be smaller than the resolving spatial resolution of the scanner. There are no arteries arising from the left coronary sinus (this is discordant from the echocardiographic findings; see discussion).  Sinoatrial node branch arises from proximal left circumflex. It is hypertrophied.

2.  The right coronary artery is of normal origin in the right coronary sinus. However, the right coronary artery is extremely dilated throughout its course. A normal infundibular branch is identified followed by acute and oblique marginal branches. The RCA gives rise to a two severely dilated posterior descending arteries extending to the apex and to a posterolateral branch in the left atrioventricular grove.

3. Subtle dilation of the left ventricle.
Anomalous Left Coronary Artery Arising form the Pulmonary Artery (ALCAPA)
The differential diagnosis for dilatation of the coronary arteries includes Kawasaki disease, coronary arteryâ€“coronary sinus fistula, atherosclerosis- related coronary artery ectasia, vasculitis (polyarteritis nodosa or Takayasu arteritis), scleroderma, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and trauma.
The patient is 6-year-old girl who initially presents with exertional chest pain. 

No family history of heart disease or anomalies was reported.
Echocardiogram Results:

Left main coronary artery is mildly dilated and arises from the medial aspect of the main pulmonary artery, 8 mm above the pulmonary valve. Retrograde flow draining into the MPA by Doppler. Dilated right main coronary artery and posterior descending coronary with multiple intramyocardial collaterals noted. Unable to exclude tiny coronary vs. collateral arising from the left facing sinus of Valsalva.

Mildly dilated left ventricle with normal systolic function. No obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities identified.

The mitral valve structure appears normal without regurgitation or stenosis. Slight echobright appearance of papillary muscle heads and proximal chords consistent with mild endocardial fibroelastosis.

Small collateral vessel noted appearing to arise from the descending aorta, coursing towards the right pulmonary artery.

Normal right ventricular size and systolic function.

No pericardial effusion.
