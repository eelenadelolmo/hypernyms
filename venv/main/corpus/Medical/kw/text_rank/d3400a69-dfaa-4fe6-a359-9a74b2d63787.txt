This exam reveals a right posterior parietal lobe AVM which measures 2.1 x 1.5 x 1.7cm. It has an enlarged feeding artery from a branch of the distal right middle cerebral artery and a large draining vein which communicates with the superior sagittal sinus. A right posterior communicating artery branch, possibly the parietoocipital branch, also supplies this AVM. No eloquent areas of brain parenchyma are affected by this AVM. No MR angiogram was obtained and therefore a concomitant aneurysm in the region of the AVM cannot be entirely excluded. It is possible that collateral veins draining through the right choroid are present as there is a tangle of vessels leading to the posterior right occipital horn. However, these may represent arterial supply as well. No solid masses are seen within the brain or extraaxial spaces to suggest metastases as queried.
AVM of the right posterior parietal lobe
Aneurysm (lesion is not single)
spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (multiple vessels),
stroke (no cytotoxic edema, change in time, or increase diffusion) 
intracranial neoplasms (vascular flow voids rather than mass)
amyloid angiopathy (unilateral, not correct age, no hemorrhage)
21 y/o WM with melanoma stage IIB. MRI of the brain was performed to assess for occult metastatic disease.
None unique to this case.
