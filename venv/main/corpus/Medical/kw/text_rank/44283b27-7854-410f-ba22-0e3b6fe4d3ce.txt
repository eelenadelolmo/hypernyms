Positive tenderness to palpation in bilateral snuffbox regions.  Positive Watsonâ€™s test bilaterally
Th patient underwent bilateral scaphocapitolunate arthrodesis because of bilateral scapholunate dissociation.  The patient tolerated the procedures well and lost minimal range of motion in the right wrist.  The patient is undergoing occupational therapy following the left wrist operation.  The patient will have to be evaluated yearly for development of significant osteoarthritis of bilateral wrist and may require wrist fusion in the future secondary to radiocarpal arthritis.
Standard wrist radiographs show an approximately 5mm of widening between the scaphoid and lunate.  No apparent scaphoid fracture.  Lateral radiograph does not show volar or dorsal intercalated segmental instability.  No evidence of distal radioulnar joint disruption.  No evidence of early osteoarthritis.
Scapholunate dissociation
Scapholunate dissociation on the radiographs

Clinically differential dx includes scaphoid fracture, tear of scapholunate ligament, distal radial fracture
46 y/o African American male presents with bilateral wrist pain right>left.  Patient states that approximately one year ago he fell from a height of 10 feet onto bilateral outstretched hands.  Patient had immediate pain to both wrists without deformity.  Patient did not seek medical attention at that time and finished his work day.  Since that incident he has had increasingly severe bilateral wrist pain only alleviated by rest rest and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications.  The patient is otherwise well.
Most common and most significant ligamentous injury to the wrist.  The mechanism is same as scaphoid fracture in which there is stress loading of the extended carpal bones.  The hyperextension causes a tear in the scapholunate interosseous ligament.  This injury always requires surgery and should be referred to an orthopedist or hand surgeon for adequate expeditious.
