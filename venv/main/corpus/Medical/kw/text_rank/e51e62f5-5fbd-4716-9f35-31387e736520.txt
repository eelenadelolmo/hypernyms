He was treated with external beam radiation therapy.
Axial CT through level of nasopharynx
-Asymmetry of the soft tissues with slight increase in attenuation in the left lateral nasopharyngeal recess (AKA Fossa of Rosenmuller)
-Well circumscribed hyperattenuated soft tissue mass in location of lymph nodes (Node of Rouvierre)

Axial CT through level of nasopharynx
-Obliteration of the normal fat planes in the pterygopalatine fossa

Sagittal T1 at midline
-Nasopharyngeal fullness, convex rather than concave toward brain
-Replacement of normal T1-bright marrow signal in clivus
-Some opacification of the sphenoid sinus

Sagittal T1 at midline
-Sphenoid opacified
-Posterior to maxilla and anterior to sphenoid bone is pterygopalatine fossa, which appears to be full of a soft tissue density 
-Able to see foramen rotundum, widened with mass filling foramen 

Axial T2 through the level of the orbits
-Sphenoid is opacified with T2 bright signal, consistent with mucus secondary to mass blocking outflow of sinus

Axial SPGR fat-saturated post-contrast (T1 spin gradient technique)
-Enlarged and enhancing nodes of left anterior cervical chain and skull base, including Node of Rouvierre

Coronal T1 post-gadolinium fat-saturated at the nasopharynx
-Can see extension through foramen ovale
-Some enhancing opacification of inferior sphenoid sinus
-Loss of fat planes in area of levator/tensor veli palatini and pterygoid muscles
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
-Nasopharyngeal tumors (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lymphoma, minor salivary gland tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, juvenile angiofibroma)
-Malignant ottitis externa
-Benign Adenoidal Hypertrophy
-Abscess
-Mucocele
-Nasal polyps
35 yo Korean man with a 4.5 month history of left cervical lymphadenopathy not responsive to antibiotics.  The patient also reports a 6 week history of left facial parasthesias and occasional left sided epistaxis and sinusitis.
