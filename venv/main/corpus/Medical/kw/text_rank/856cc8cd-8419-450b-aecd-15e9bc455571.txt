Patient had a gastrojujenostomy because of ischemia and massive adhesions.

Two mesh from previous surgeries were also located.  These pieces of mesh were removed and may have contributed to this late presentation of internal hernia.

Subsequent  to this most recent surgery, the patient fully recovered and her abdominal pain resolved. The anemia present at the patient's initial presentation also resolved.
CT of Abdomen: 
1. Markedly distended stomach and proximal portion of the duodenum with abrupt decompression of the duodenum at the level of the third portion with swirling of mesenteric vessels. Recommend surgical consultation.
2. Multiple loops of fluid filled bowel within the right upper quadrant without discrete evidence of focal bowel wall thickening. 

Upper GI Series with contrast:
1. Delayed flow of contrast from the duodenal bulb into the proximal C-loop. Once this has occurred, there is an opacification of the proximal jejunal segments which are primarily located in the right upper quadrant.
Transmesenteric hernia (internal hernia), small bowel volvulus
•Mesenteric ischemia
•Enteritis
•Internal hernia with small bowel volvulus
• Adhesive bands
