PFTs:
1) Restrictive pattern.
2) Decreased DLCO.
1) OLD STUDIES (2001) -
1a) Plain film - Fine to medium reticular pattern, greater in the bases. 
1b) Corresponding HRCT single axial image - Interlobular septal thickening, peripheral honeycombing. (Ground glass appearance not well represented on select image but highly characteristic). 
2) NEW STUDY - 08 OCT 2003 -   
2a) Plain Film - Coarse reticular patterning generalized throughout both lungs. Low lung volumes bilaterally. No evidence of bullous change.
UIP - Usual Interstitial Pneumonia
1) Acute Interstitial Pneumonia
2) Desquamative Interstitial Pneumonia
3) Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organizing Pneumonia (BOOP)
4) Respiratory Bronchiolitis-Associated Interstitial Lung Disease
5) Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia
6) Rheumatoid Lung Disease
7) Other Autoimmune Inflammatory Lung Diseases (SLE, Polymyositis/Dermatomyositis, Ankylosing Spondylitis, Scleroderma)
8) Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis
