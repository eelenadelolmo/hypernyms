Diffusely tender abdomen with voluntary guarding. All labs were normal. Pt was tachycardic but afebrile.

Complete Bowel obstruction

Gallstone ileus
52y/o female with colicky, poorly localized abdominal pain beginning approximately 12 hours prior to presentation. The patient had vomited numerous times and was not passing stool or flatus.
A similar scenario has occured to this patient on 2 other occasions. No other CT studies are available for review, so it is unclear if the same anatomic point is the nidus for the obstruction each time.
