Abnormal Study With Development Of Thin Cortical Calcifications, Which Extend Into The Medullary Spaces Along The Columns Of Bertin, As Well As Heterogeneous Enhancement Of The Kidneys And Minimal Delayed Excretion.

The Overall Pattern Is Compatible With Acute Cortical Necrosis.
Cortical nephrocalcinosis due to acute renal cortical necrosis
Acute renal cortical necrosis
