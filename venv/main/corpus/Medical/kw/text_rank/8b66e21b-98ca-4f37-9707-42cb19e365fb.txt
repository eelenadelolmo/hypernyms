Physical exam revealed fixed and dilated pupils, no spontaneous respirations, and no brainstem reflexes.
Labs are unknown.
None
Non-contrast CT head reveals diffuse brain swelling with loss of gray-white matter differentiation and absence of sulci. Lateral & 3rd ventricles are also effaced. There is also evidence of bilateral uncal and transtentorial herniation. Tc-99m HMPAO Planar Brain Scan reveals lack of flow to middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery. There is flow in the aorta, left common carotid left subclavian artery with small uptake in right common carotid artery. In the blood pool phase there is no accumulation within the superior sagittal or transverse sinuses. There is normal external carotid artery activity with normal scalp perfusion. Delayed planar images show no tracer accumulation in the brain.

Brain death is defined  as the complete and irreversible cessation of brain function. The term is primarily a clinical diagnosis and includes:
1. Total absence of brainstem reflexes or spontaneous respirations
2. Potentially reversible causes must be excluded
3. Cause of brainstem dysfunction must be diagnosed
4. Findings of BD must be present for a defined period of observation (6-24 hours)

However, ancillary studies may be used, including the neurologic exam, electroencephalography, cerebral angiography, and cerebral scintigraphy. Cerebral scintigrahy is especially useful as it is relatively non-invasive and is not affected by drug intoxication or hypothermia. The preferred radiopharmaceuticals are Tc99m HMPAO and Tc99mECD. Diagnostic findings are the lack of intracranial arterial flow, no visualization of major venous sinuses, and no visualization of the brain parenchyma. The pathophysiology behind this study is based on the intracranial pressure exceeding cerebral perfusion pressure. A marker of increased intracranial pressure is demonstrated by the "hot nose" sign where the elevated intracranial pressure diverts intracranial blood flow into the external carotid artery, and results in increased flow to the face and nose.  This finding supports brain death.
