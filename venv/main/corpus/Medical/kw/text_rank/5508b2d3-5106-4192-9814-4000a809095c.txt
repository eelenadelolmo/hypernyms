The MRI/MRA study showed no vascular pathology, but incidentally it was noted that there was a heterogeneous and mildly expanded clivus.

Whole body skeletal scintigraphy showed nonspecific increased uptake in the clivus region.

Repeat CT of the sinus was performed, revealing a “ground glass appearance”, containing a smaller circumscribed area, which has the appearance of a cystic lesion.  Overall the process appeared nonaggressive and was stable on 5 month follow-up CT.
