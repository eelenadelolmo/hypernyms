Focal pain with deep palpation in mid-diaphyseal region of left tibia.
This patient was referred to the orthopedic surgery service for further management. The patient opted to receive a profile to curb physical training with possibility of radiofrequency abalation in the near future.
>> Radionuclide bone scan shows focal intense uptake of radioisotope corresponding to the site of radiographic abnormality, which is consistent with osteoid osteoma. 

>> Lateral view of the left tibia shows a radiolucent defect in the cortex of the bone
Cortical Osteoid Osteoma
Initial primary considerations in this patient would be:

Stress fracture
Shin splints ( medial tibial stress syndrome )
Benign and malignant bone tumors
Infection ( osteomyelitis )
25 yo male patient with history of focal pain in left tibia for 4 months.He reports that the pain wakes him from sleep at times. In addition his symptoms are exacerbated by running and smptomatic improvement is noted after taking NSAIDs.
This case illustrates the importance of correlative imaging in radiographic evaluation along with the additional specificity gained by taking and incorporating a good clinical history.
