Osteopenia.  Numerous foci of soft tissue calcification within the phalanges.  Mild resorption distal tuft right fifth distal phalanx.  Mild osteophytosis, joint space loss multiple joints both hands.
CREST syndrome
Scleroderma
Dermatomyositis
Renal osteodystrophy / secondary hyperparathyroidism
83 year old female with increase in right thumb laxity.
Periarticular and other focal soft tissue calcifications within the phalanges and acroosteolysis within the hands is relatively specific for scleroderma (or its variant form, CREST syndrome).  Dermatomyositis could present with acroosteolysis and soft tissue calcifications; however, the calcifications typically are sheetlike interfascial calcifications.
Hyperparathyroidism is can produce acroosteolysis and soft tissue calcifications as in this case; however, no ancillary signs (e.g. subperiosteal resorption along the radial margin of the second and third middle phalanges) is present.
