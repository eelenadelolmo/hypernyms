Vital signs: Afebrile, mildly tachycardic (102), BP 117/67, respirations non-labored, regular, oxygen saturation on room air 98%. Patient c/o pain 8/10 described as achy, located centrally in his chest and exacerbated by coughing. On physical exam, he is AAOx3, in NAD; HEENT: NC/AT, PERRLA, EOMI, no conjunctival injection, B/L tympanic membranes intact and clear, moist mucous membranes, sinuses not TTP, no pharyngeal exudate/erythema, trachea midline; CV: tachycardic, no MRG; Respiratory: Fine crackles heard best at left sternal border during inspiration, also heard in right upper and right lower lung lobe; Abdomen: S/NT/ND, +BS, no HSM; Extremities: No CCE, no skin rashes.

Laboratory values: WBC 16.5, H&H 16.5/50.3, Glucose 286; ABG: pH 7.44/36/64/24/0/93%, during assessment oxygen saturation dropped to 88% with coughing; Urinalysis: glucose high, ketones, no leukocyte esterase; Blood culture: negative x2; HIV negative, RPR negative, sputum negative; ECG: NSR
Prior to the return of initial imaging results and based on his physical exam findings (crackles, tachycardia, elevated white blood cell count) patient was treated with IV antibiotics, oxygen via nasal cannula, and fluid resuscitation.  He experienced one episode of oxygen desaturation secondary to coughing during his emergency room visit. Patient was admitted for monitoring of his vital signs and kept NPO while additional testing was in progress. During his three day hospitalization, he experienced no additional episodes of desaturation and demonstrated resolution of his subcutaneous emphysema.
Chest radiographs: Initial CXR (figure 1) demonstrates subcutaneous gas in the left supraclavicular soft-tissues; vertically-oriented gas densities are also noted in the mediastinum; follow-up CXR (figure 3) demonstrates interval decrease in the gas collection with mediastinal gas densities; no pneumothorax is appreciated.

Computed tomography of chest: Initial CT (figure 2) confirms gas within the left supraclavicular space; subsequent CT images (figures 4,5) demonstrate pneumomediastinum with gas tracking into the neck and supraclavicular spaces (arrows).

21 y/o man from the U.S. Virgin Islands presented with a chief complaint of chest pain and cough productive of yellowish sputum.  He has a PMHx of Type I diabetes (on insulin).  He is a current student at a local community college in Miami, Florida.  He has no recent travel history or sick exposure, and he is up to date on his immunizations.  His social history is significant for smoking 0.25 PPD for 3 years and although initially denied, daily inhalational cannabis use.   He has had no nausea, vomiting, or fevers. All other ROS is negative.  He has no allergies and no previous surgical history. Family history is negative for cancer or asthma.
Unique to this patient is his history of smoking as well as inhalational cannabis use. Initially, he denied illicit drug use; later, it was discovered that he smoked cannabis up to 10 times per day and also had a more extensive smoking history than previously documented. These are both predisposing factors to his ultimate diagnosis of exclusion of spontaneous pneumomediastinum. Of note, patients who engage in inhalational drug use often use valsalva techniques in order to increase the effect of inhaled drugs. Valsalve type activities which lead to rapid changes in intrathoracic pressure can then lead to alveolar rupture. In retrospect, pulmonary findings on physical exam in this patient also revealed Hamman's sign (Hammond's sign/Hammond's crunch, named for Dr. Louis Hamman) - an adventitious sound heard in cycle with the the heartbeat, not respirations, which is often heard best in the left lateral decubitis position or at the left sternal border and is most pronounced during inspiration. Associated with pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, and Boerhaave syndrome, this physical exam finding is often attributed to rales or crackles heard with atelectasis or pneumonia (where fluid or mucous in the peripheral lung causes alveoli to collapse and these alveoli are heard to pop back open during inspiration).
