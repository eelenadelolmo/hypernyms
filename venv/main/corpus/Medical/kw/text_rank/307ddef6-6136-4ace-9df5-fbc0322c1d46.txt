Neurological and physical exam were within normal limits. 
No significant laboratory findings.
The patient's symptoms did not abate and she ultimately had the lesion excised after embolization.
Gadloinium enahaced MRI of the bran demonstated a well circumscribed nodular extraaxial mass lesion within the left temporal region that demonstrated homogeneous enhancement.
