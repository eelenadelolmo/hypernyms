No respiratory stridor was present.
This child had a high degree of suspicion for foreign body aspiration which was reinforced by plain film evaluation.  he was then evaluated by the ENT department with brocoscopy. A leggo piece was removed from the right main bronchus.
The frontal and lateral views of the thorax show hyperaeration and increased lucency of the right hemithorax.  The decubitis films demonstrate no movement of the diaphram on the right.
Foreign Body Aspiration
Mucus plugging
Foreign body aspiration
19 month old male with suspected foreign body ingestion.
The plain films demonstrate the persistent hyperinflation of the right hemithorax due to the ball-valve mechansism caused by the foreign body.  There is also increased lucency of the right thorax caused by both the increased air volume as well as the physiologic shunting of blood away from the involved lung.  These findings were more obvious on the upright views but the airtrapping persisted on the decubitus exams.
