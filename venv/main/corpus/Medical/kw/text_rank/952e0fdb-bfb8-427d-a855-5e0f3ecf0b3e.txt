Unknown; however, the patient should have a follow-up MRI to exclude multiple sclerosis.
Although ADEM more commonly involves the white matter, especially in the subcortical region, the gray matter may also be involved.  On MRI patients typically present with multiple foci of hyperintensity on T2W images.  These lesions may or may not be associated with enhancement.  In that ADEM is a monophasic process, no new lesions should develop after 6 months following clinical presentation.

20 y.o. man who developed seizures 2 weeks after receiving the small pox vaccination.
This case nicely shows the multiple T2 hyperintensities scattered throughout the deep white matter in the brain and C-spine in a patient who recently received the small pox vaccination.  He clinically presented with new onset seizures.  As this is a new finding in this patient, it was recommended to obtain a follow-up MRI to exclude multiple sclerosis.
