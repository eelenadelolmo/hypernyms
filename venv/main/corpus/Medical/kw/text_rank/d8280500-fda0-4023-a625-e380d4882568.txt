Physical exam reveals a murmur that is difficult to localize in location and difficult to locate in the cardiac cycle.  A difference in blood pressure between the upper and lower extremities was also found.
Balloon angioplasty of the area of stenosis.
The study revealed a standard three-vessel arch with the brachiocephalic artery being the first great vessel, the left common carotid being the second vessel, and the left subclavian artery being the third vessel. Just proximal to the takeoff of the left subclavian artery is a significant web across the lumen of the aortic. This aortic web is seen to cause significant obstruction of flow through the aorta. A momentary delay was seen before blood flow was seen distal to the obstruction.  A central post-stenotic jet was seen traveling through the thoracic aorta to below the level of the diaphragm. No obvious collateral blood vessels are noted throughout the thoracic aorta. No other cardiac abnormalities were identified.
COARCTATION
Recurrent coarctation / restenosis at the site of the procedure.
This case is based on a 3 year old female who at the age of 18 months underwent surgical resection with end-to-end repair of a mild preductal coarctation of the aorta just proximal to the left subclavian artery take-off.
The patent underwent a balloon angioplasty procedure in hopes of relieving the obstruction before significant post-stenotic dilatation could occur and avoid repeat surgery which carries a significant chance of both morbidity and mortality.
