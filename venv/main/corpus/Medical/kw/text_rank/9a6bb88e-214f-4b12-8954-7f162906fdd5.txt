The catheter can no longer be palpated underneath the skin.
Snare retrieval of catheter fragment through a moderate sized vascular sheath placed in the right common femoral vein.
Immediate post mediport chest radiograph demonstrates appropriately positioned catheter. Approximately three months later, repeat chest radiograph shows fracture of the catheter at the hub with embolization of the free fragment into the right atrium and projectiong over the heart.

Several intra-procedural fluroscopic images show the catheter to extend into the IVC. Serial images demonstrate a snare positioned the around the catheter with retraction inferiorly out the right femoral vein access site. 

A final photograph shows the free catheter lodged in the access sheath.
Subclavian Central Venous Catheter Fracture and Embolization
Catheter fragmentation or separation at the hub can be secondary to the following causes:
-Operator error during implantation (failure to attach catheter securely to port)
-Twiddler's Syndrome (Patient twisting and playing with the catheter port constantly.  This also occurs with pacemakers)
-Product failure
-Inappropriate use of catheter for power inject of contrast
-Mechanical wear
-As a complication of a catheter stripping procedure
74 year old female with history of ovarian cancer and in-dwelling chest mediport in the the right subclavian vein for chemotherapy.
Fragments that embolize to the right heart are relatively easy to retrieve unless they are adherent to the atrial wall (covered with white thrombus and epithelialized).  Operators should proceed with caution in this situation.  If a chronic catheter fragment is not arrhythmogenic, it should probably be left alone. Catheter fragments can also embolize to the pulmonary arteries making retrieval more challenging.  Lidocaine should be on hand and left heart block ruled out before catheterizing the pulmonary arteries, a procedure that is seldom done in this era of multichannel CT and MRA.
