Patellar tendinosis, also known as Jumper's Knee, is the result of micro and partial macro-tearing of patellar tendon fibers, usually due to repetitive running and/or jumping (Basketball, Football, and Volleyball). Either the patellar or tibial enthesis may be involved; however the condition is most often associated with patellar attachment involvement. Treatment is generally conservative.
