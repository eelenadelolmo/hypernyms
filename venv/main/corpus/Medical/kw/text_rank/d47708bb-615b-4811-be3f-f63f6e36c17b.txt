Guarding and mild rebound tenderness.
No treatment or followup is required for uncomplicated transient small bowel intussusception.  Consideration can be given to further imaging and/or endoscopic (i.e., capsule) or direct visualization if a pathologic lead mass lesion (i.e., neoplasm, celiac disease, scleroderma, bowel wall hematoma, inverted Meckel diverticulum) is suspected.
Multiple intraveneous- and contrast-enhanced axial CT images of the abdomen demonstrate a receiving intussuscipiens surrounding both the intussusceptum and its associated mesenteric fat and vessels.
