RLQ pain
Clinical: Typical clinical presentation of periumbilical pain that gradually moves to the right lower quadrant at Mc Burney point. All ages affected, M=F.

Imaging: Sonography is the initial imaging evaluation in children and young females.  Perforation deceases sensitivity and accuracy of ultrasound. Characteristic sonographic features include a noncompressible, blind ending, tubular structure greater than 6mm in diameter in longitudinal sequence.  On transverse a target appearance with central luminal fluid and hyperechoic mucosa with hypoechoic muscle layer.  In this case an associated appendicolith is demonstrated as an echogenic focus with distal acoustic shadowing.  Perforation would demonstrate loss of echogenic submucosal layer with increased periappendiceal echogenicity and periappendiceal fluid collection.
	CT findings: dilated appendix greater than 7 mm, periappendiceal stranding of fat, appendicolith, abnormal enhancement, focal bowel wall thickening at cecal tip.
