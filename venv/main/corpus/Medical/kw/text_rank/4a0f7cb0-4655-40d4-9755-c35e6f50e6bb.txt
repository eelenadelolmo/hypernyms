Note is made of a vague area of hyperdensity seen in the right lobe of the liver inferolaterally measuring 1.7 x 1.6 cm.  Delayed images demonstrate this area to be less conspicuous.  There is no liver laceration identified and there is no free fluid or inflammation 
seen in the abdomen or pelvis.  Remainder of the liver demonstrates mild fatty infiltration, without evidence of focal lesion.  The liver is normal in size and normal in contour.   Ultrasound of the liver is recommended for further evaluation.
