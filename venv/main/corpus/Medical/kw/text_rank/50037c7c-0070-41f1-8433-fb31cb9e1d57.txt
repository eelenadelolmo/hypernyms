50 y.o. woman with no past medical history complains of burning epigastric pain for the last month - usually one to two hours after eating a meal. 
Occasional nausea and vomiting with the pain; and, symptoms have increased in frequency over the last two weeks. She has had some relief with over the counter antacids - but felt it was time to see a doctor who prescribed Prilosec and told her to schedule an air-contrast upper GI study.
