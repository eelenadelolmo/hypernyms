Multiple age-related degenerative changes are seen throughout the cervical spine.  Specifically of interest, there is a well corticated oblong calcific density seen in the soft tissues posterior to the C5 and C6 vertebral bodies.
Normal variant: Calcification in the ligamentum nuchae
- Ossification of the ligamentum nuchae
- Fracture with posterior displacement of a spinous  process
73 year old man who reports diffuse vague neck pain secondary to a fall.
Accessory ossicle(s) adjacent to the C6 or C7 spinous processes represent dystrophic calcification of the soft tissues (in this case the ligamentum nuchae). This variant appears with advancing age and diagnosed as a coincidental finding. In some instances, the condition may simulate a healed fracture of the adjacent spinous process. In this particular case, lack of knowledge of this common normal variant led to an unneeded emergency CT of the C-spine.
