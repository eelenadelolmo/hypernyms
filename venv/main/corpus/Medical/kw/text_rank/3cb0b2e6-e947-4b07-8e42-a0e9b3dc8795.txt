Physical exam was normal for an infant of this gestational age.  Neurologic examination did not demonstrate any focal deficits, and all reflexes were age appropriate.  Laboratory studies were unremarkable.
The images demonstrate dilated ventricles with evidence of subependymal, intraventricular, and parenchymal hemorrhage.  There is persistent ventricular dilation on follow-up, despite improvement of intraventricular and parenchymal hemorrhage.
Germinal matrix hemorrhage
• Germinal matrix hemorrhage
• Intraventricular hemorrhage with ventricular dilatation
• Parenchymal hemorrhage
Newborn female infant twin of Di-Di gestation born at 28 weeks and 3 days.  These images were obtained at 7 days of life and at 30 days of life in the NICU.
Germinal matrix, intraventicular, and parenchymal hemorrhage related to prematurity. Hydrocephalus persists on follow-up.
