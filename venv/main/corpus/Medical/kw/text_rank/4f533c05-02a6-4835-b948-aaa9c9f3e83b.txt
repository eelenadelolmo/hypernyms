Rheumatoid factor positive
There are combined findings of degeneration and inflammation at the right hip.  Erosion of the femoral neck suggests inflammation, but the erosion has a rim of sclerosis, compatible with an old, inactive injury.  Joint space loss is greatest superiorly, which along with the mild subarticular sclerosis, are findings compatible with osteoarthitis (likely secondary OA -- related to the old inflammation).  The partially evaluated left total hip arthroplasty appears intact, with presence of acetabular protrusio (a finding associated with weakened bone -- to include patients with chronic rheumatoid arthritis).
Old, inactive rheumatoid arthritis affecting both hips (total hip replacement on left, erosive change on right)
The femoral neck erosion is a nonspecific finding.  Old treated septic arthritis should be considered.  Alternatively, pressure erosion from pigmented villonodular synovitis or synovial chondromatosis should be entertained, and MRI should allow diagnosis of either of these conditions.  In chronic illness associated with development of amyloidosis -- or in the setting of chronic hemodialysis -- amyloidosis could give this appearance.
