Diffuse joint tenderness on palpation.
Total synovectomy with external beam radiation.
Plain films: AP and lateral radiography show mild bony demineralization. A small to moderate joint effusion is also seen. 

MRI:  Proton-density sequence that shows cystic changes at the origin of the gastrocnemius. A low attenuated signal lesion is observed in the posterior joint space along with moderate joint effusion. Sagittal T2 Fat Suppresion showing areas of low attenuation intermixed with areas of high attenuation within the posterior joint space.  A T2 Fast Spin Echo sequence with fat saturation showing low attenuation in the posterior compartment of the joint space, referred to as ‘blooming’.
