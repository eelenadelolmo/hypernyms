Afferent Roux limb of small bowel
Iatrogenic Diverticula
Pre-surgical small bowel Diverticula
Afferent limb of small bowel
51 year old female with morbid obesity, hyperlipidemia, GERD.  Post-operative day #1 for laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and normal post-operative course presenting for routine swallow study.
An afferent limb of small bowel may be mistaken for a diverticula while performing a swallow study.  Resources may be wasted and post-operative recovery course may be slowed in ordering a CT to clear a possibly confusing swallow study.  This patient did not require further work-up.  The surgeon stated that the small bowel surgically attached to the pouch (stomach) was attached 4-5cm distal to the end of small bowel.
