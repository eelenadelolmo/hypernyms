Bucket handle tears most commonly occur in the medial meniscus and are of traumatic origin.  The most common site of a medial meniscal tear is the posterior horn (60%).  However,  approximately 22% involve the entire meniscus and a portion of these create a free margin bucket handle deformity.  A small meniscal body is another indicatior of a bucket handle tear.
