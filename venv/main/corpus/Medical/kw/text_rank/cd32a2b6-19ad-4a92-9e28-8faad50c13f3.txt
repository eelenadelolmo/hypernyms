Multiple erythematous nodules, some with superficial ulceration, and plaques distributed over hands, wrists, forearms, bilateral lower extremities, and feet. Hyperpigmented plaques on scalp.
Heme/Onc administered 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy with clinical remission of the nodules. Biopsy was performed at three previously involved sites, which revealed an atypical T-cell lymphoid infiltrate felt to represent residual T-cell lymphoma. Total skin electron beam (TSEB) therapy was administered for 9 weeks. The patient had clinical remission of all active lesions. Follow up was scheduled for 3 months after completing TSEB.
