Hemangioblastomas are uncommon vascular tumors of the central nervous system that occur mainly in the cerebellum and spinal cord. They are benign neoplasms of endothelial origin; most commonly seen in young and middle aged adults.  They are the most common primary cerebellar neoplasm in adults 40-60 years old.  Among patients with hemangioblastoma, 25 percent occur in those with von Hippel-Lindau disease. On the other hand, hemangioblastomas are the most common lesions associated with VHL disease, eventually affecting 44 to 80 percent of patients. Sporadic hemangioblastoma are usually solitary; multiple tumors within the neuraxis should raise suspicion for VHL disease.
Hemangioblastomas cause neurologic deficits, both by direct compression or tumor-associated hemorrhage. The specific deficit from direct compression depends upon tumor location, and may include cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor nerve dysfunction, motor weakness, or sensory deficits. Patients with spinal hemangioblastomas frequently present with pain.  Secondary to this associated risk of hemorrhage, surgical treatment is indicated, as in this patient.

The diagnostic procedure of choice is gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  The classic appearance is a well-defined cystic mass with an intensely enhancing mural nodule (60% of cases).  Because the tumor nodule receives it’s blood supply from the pia mater, the nodule, which represents the tumor itself, is almost always superficial.  Up to 40% are entirely solid.  In these cases, the margins can be ill-defined and occasionally can see hemorrhage.  Surrounding edema may be present.  Flow voids within the nodule may be present.

An acute hemorrhage secondary to hemangioblastoma can be catastrophic.  Intracerebral bleeding from a cerebellar hemangioblastoma may cause rapid obstructive hydrocephalus, cerebellar tonsillar herniation, brainstem compression, or uncal herniation. Bleeding from a spinal hemangioblastoma may result in acute quadriplegia or paraplegia from hemorrhage into the spinal cord.  Headache, back pain, or radiculopathy can result from subarachnoid hemorrhage. In these situations, emergency neurosurgical intervention is indicated.
