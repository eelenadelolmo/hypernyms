• Dural sinus thrombophlebitis from infection
55 y.o. woman presented to the ED 4 days after minor head trauma with a progressively worsening headache.  She had no significant past medical history.
It was felt that the initial head trauma was so minimal that it was likely unrelated to the SAH.  The patient is undergoing extensive workup to determine the etiology of the dural sinus thrombosis.
