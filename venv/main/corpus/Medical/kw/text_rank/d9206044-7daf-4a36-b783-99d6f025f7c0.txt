Shoulder Plain Films:
The humeral head is internally rotated and laterally displaced on AP view with decreased, glenoid-humeral overlap. A linear lucency along the anterior margin of the humeral head is identified. On scapular-Y view, there is posterior displacement of the humeral head from the glenoid fossa.                        
IMPRESSION: Right posterior humeral dislocation with impaction fracture along the anterior humeral head.            

Shoulder CT:
There is posterior dislocation of the right shoulder with a   prominent longitudinal impaction fracture of the anterior humeral head positioned on the posterior aspect of the bony glenoid.             
IMPRESSION: Posterior right shoulder displacement with longitudinal impaction fracture of the humeral head.
Posterior shoulder dislocation
A 30 year old male involved in a MVA presented complaining of right shoulder pain.
Posterior dislocation is less common than anterior dislocation (~5%). It is usually the result of direct or indirect force. It is commonly associated with seizures or electricution. Radiographic findings include humeral head superior to the glenoid, a trough sign (compression fracture of the anterior humerous, seen best on the AP view with external rotation, or with an axillary view), and a sharp angle of Moloney's arch (scapulohumeral arch). Posterior displacement is best seen with the axillary view. Loss of the glenohumeral space is diagnostic on a Grashey view (40 degree posterior oblique).
