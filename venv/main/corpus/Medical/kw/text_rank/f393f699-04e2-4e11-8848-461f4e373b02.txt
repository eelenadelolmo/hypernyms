Acute knee injury while playing basketball.
Fat-fluid levels in the knee are typically detected on cross-table lateral views of the knee because the beam must be parallel to the fluid-fat interface. The beam was fortuitously parallel to this interface on the sunrise view thus replicating the physics of the cross-table lateral view of the knee.
