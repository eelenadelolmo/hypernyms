Pt has known rheumatoid arthritis.
Pharmacologic therapy is the therapeutic mainstay for all patients except those in remission. Four main classes of drugs are currently used:1) Analgesics — drugs that only provide analgesia include acetaminophen (eg, paracetamol), tramadol (Ultram), locally applied capsaicin (Zostrix), and narcotics (eg, codeine); however, narcotics should be avoided because of their addictive properties.  2) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs — NSAIDs have both analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties but do not alter disease outcomes.  Agents that block prostaglandin production by selectively inhibiting the COX-2 isoform appear to share analgesic and antiinflammatory activity with conventional NSAIDs, but exhibit significantly less gastroduodenal toxicity.   3) Glucocorticoids — prednisone or prednisolone are most commonly used to suppress inflammation, and may be administered orally, intravenously, or by intraarticular injection.  4) SAARDs or DMARDs — A miscellaneous group of drugs termed slow-acting antirheumatic drugs (SAARDs) or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have the potential to reduce or prevent joint damage, preserve joint integrity and function, reduce health costs, and maintain economic productivity.* Such agents include azathioprine, cyclosporine, D-penicillamine, gold salts, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide, methotrexate, and sulfasalazine.

PA  and lateral radiographs of the hands and wrists show periarticular osteopenia. Subluxations, flexion and extension deformities including boutonniere and swan-neck deformities, and joint space narrowing are present at the proximal interphalangeal joints and joint space narrowing at the intercarpal joints. Both first metacarpophalangeal joints are ankylosed with surgical pins traversing these joints.  Joint prostheses are present at the left 2nd and 3rd metacarpo-phalangeal joints and the right 2nd-5th metacarpophalangeal joints.
Rheumatoid arthritis
Findings consistent with advanced inflammatory arthropathy with post-surgical changes and ankyloses as described above  and consistent with the patient's known rheumatoid arthritis.
