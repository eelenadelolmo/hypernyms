Anterior fontanelle is soft and flat.
Palate and clavicles are intact.  
Chest excursion is symmetric with no distress at the time of examination. Air entry is good bilaterally.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm without murmurs on admission.  
Pulses and perfusion are good.  Three-vessel cord is noted.  
Abdomen is soft and appears to be nontender.  Genitourinary exam is normal male with bilaterally descended testes.  
Anus is patent.  
Back is closed with no appreciable sacral dimpling.  The remainder of the physical examination is
essentially normal for a preterm newborn male.
Echocardiogram
Renal ultrasound
Spinal ultrasound
Barium Swallow
Surgical repair
NG tube tip is in the proximal esophageal pouch in this patient with 
known esophageal atresia. 
Lungs are well-expanded with faint diffuse opacification which could be secondary to retained fetal lung fluid . 
No pneumothorax or pleural effusions.

Absent gas in the abdomen.

No evidence of vertebral anomalies.
Esophageal Atresia, type A
Esophageal atresia
VACTERL
newborn boy born at 33-3/7 week gestational age by C-section with known prenatal diagnosis of polyhydramnios and esophageal atresia.
Patient underwent a series of evaluation for VACTERL association.  
His spinal ultrasound was normal. Renal ultrasound showed some mildly dilated calyces, but otherwise normal.
Echocardiogram showed a large PDA. From a cardiovascular standpoint, he was stable with normal four-extremity blood pressures.  

At day 2 of his life, he was taken to the operating room for placement of a gastrostomy tube for feeding. 
At day 41 s/p G-tube, he underwent barium swallow to evaluate the gap between the distal and proximal esophagus which showed a 5 cm gap.

Patient continues to receive nutrition through G-tube, surgical repair of esophagus is needed once patient has gained appropriate weight.
