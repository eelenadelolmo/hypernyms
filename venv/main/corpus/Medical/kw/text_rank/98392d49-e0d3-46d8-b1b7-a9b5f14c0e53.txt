Therapeutic trials in the past with prednisone, cyclosporine, accutane, plaquenil, and methotrexate were discontinued secondary to adverse effects (i.e recurrent transaminitis). From January 1996 to December 2001 monthly IVIG stabilized her disease activity. She started Etanercept injections in December 2001 and has had significantly decreased exacerbations of her muscle disease. She is followed closely by GYN and had a normal gynecologic exam, mammogram, chest x-ray, and screening colonoscopy in 2002.
Labs: ANA positive 1:320 speckled; Anti-RNP, Anti-Smith, Anti-Ro/La, Anti-Jo antibodies negative; MRI of lower extremities demonstrated extensive atrophy with minimal inflammation; EMG consistant with myopathic disease; history of slightly elevated CK and aldolase when symptomatic; hepatitis panel negative.

Histopathology: The biopsy shows epidermal atrophy with compact orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, focal vacuolar interface dermatitis, dilated vessels, and an increase in dermal interstitial mucin.
