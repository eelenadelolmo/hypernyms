58 year old female with headache and confusion.
Presented to another hospital 3 weeks prior to admission with similar symptoms.  No imaging done at that time.
Due to delay in obtaining the CT study, and the fact that the hematoma was isodense with brain, the clinical team was concerned that the patient had a neoplasm did not considerer ruptured aneurysm as source of mass seen on CT.

Lack of contrast enhancement and demonstration of aneurysm on MRI convinced neurosurgeons to order an angiogram and delay contemplated biopsy.
