The plain film shows severe osteopenia.  There is a subtle area of sclerosis noted at the superior posterior aspect of the calcaneus.
On the MRI, a T1 sagital image shows a nondisplaced fracture through the calcaneus.
Calcaneal fracture in the setting of disuse osteopenia.
Secondary osteoporosis

14 yo boy with left foot pain and swelling after a physical therapy session with a new therapist.
The patient presented with pain and swelling in the left foot after a physical therapy appointment with a new therapist.  The plain film demonstrated severe osteopenia, disuse osteopenia secondary to the patientâ€™s cerebral palsy.  Due to the osteopenia, it was difficult to identify the fracture on plain film, so a further evaluation with an MRI was recommended to better evaluate the osseous structures and the soft tissues.  The MRI clearly demonstrates a  nondisplaced calcaneal fracture.
