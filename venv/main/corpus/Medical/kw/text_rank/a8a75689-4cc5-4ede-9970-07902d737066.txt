This extra axial mass demonstrates a large number of arterial feeders, typical for meningioma.

Angiographically, a large stain of contrast is seen with a central focus.  This capillary tumor blush arrives early in the arterial phase and stays late into the venous phase.  Previously coined the "mother-in-law" phenomenon, since it comes early, stays late, and usually is very dense.
