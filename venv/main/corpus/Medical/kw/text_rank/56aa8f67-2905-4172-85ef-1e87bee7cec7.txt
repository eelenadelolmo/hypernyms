PHYSICAL EXAM: Approximately 100 soft, skin colored-to-pink, 2-20 mm well circumscribed papules and plaques were present over the face, neck upper trunk, and arms. The overlying skin was wrinkled and atrophic, demonstrating herniation upon palpation. The lesions were clinically non-inflammatory. The remainder of his physical exam revealed no bony, ocular or cardiac abnormalities.

LABORATORY: Laboratory evaluation showed a positive anti-DNA antibody titer at 149 (>100 positive) and elevated anticardiolipin IgG at 47 (nl 0-22). CBC, UA, thyroid function tests, serum protein electrophoresis, Lyme titer, RPR, HIV, and anticardiolipin IgA and IgM were unremarkable.

HISTOPATHOLOGY: Hematoxylin and eosin staining of an excisional biopsy revealed a superficial and deep perivascular lymphohistiocytic dermatitis with scattered eosinophils and focal vacuolar change. A Verhoff-von Giesen elastic tissue stain demonstrated the classic histological finding of anetoderma--focal loss of elastic tissue in the reticular dermis. Direct immunofluorescence was negative for immunoglobulins, C3, and fibinogen.
The patient continues to form new lesions.
