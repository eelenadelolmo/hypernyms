PHYSICAL EXAM:Markedly crusted and fissured plaques covered the entire frontal scalp. Focal macular erythema and an isolated intact clear vesicle was seen extending on to the forehead.
LABORATORY:Bacterial culture negative
HISTOPATHOLOGY: Sections demonstrated a suprabasilar acantholytic dermatitis consistent with pemphigus vulgaris.
DIF: + intercellular epidermal IgG
IIF: Titer 1:40 IgG
Review of slide initially interpreted as squamous cell carcinoma - consistent with P. vulgaris.
Left buccal oral ulcerations developed in addition to complaints of severe sore throat. ENT evaluation revealed no pharyngeal or laryngeal involvement. After
screening labs, exams and endocrinology evaluation for long term glucocorticosteroids, he was started on prednisone 80mg QAM. After two months his scalp and oral lesions resolved and he is now continuing a slow taper without recurrence.
PEMPHIGUS VULGARIS (1997 Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, Case#7) presented by: John LeVasseur, Maj, USAF, MC, FS
Patient presented with a 6 week history of a persistent nonhealing wound over his forehead and scalp. He attributed the changes to potential irritation from chemicals in his woodworking hobby or possibly to trauma from the garage door. Prior treatment included antibiotics and griseofulvin. There was no history of skin cancer. There were no systemic symptoms and no oral complaints. A biopsy done by a civilian dermatologist was interpreted as SCC by a local pathology group.
