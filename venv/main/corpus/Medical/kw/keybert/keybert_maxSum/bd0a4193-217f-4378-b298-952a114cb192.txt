Asbestos-related pleural disease
60 y.o. man with rib contusion - r/o fracture.
Focal pleural plaques are the most common manifestation of asbestos exposure and develop 20-30 years after exposure.  Most often focal interrupted areas of plural thickening located in the posterolateral middle and lower chest bilaterally and represent hyalinized collagen in submesothelial layer of parietal pleura. The mediastinal pleural surface and costophrenic sulci are characteristically spared.  

Diffuse pleural thickening is less common than focal plaques, are associated with round atelectasis, and may cause respiratory symptoms.  

Pleural calcifications, as in this case, in the absence of hemothorax, empyema, tuberculosis or previous surgery is pathognomonic.  This requires greater than 20 years to develop.  

An early sign of asbestos-related pleural disease are pleural effusions but as with pleural calcifications other causes must be excluded.  These include malignant mesothelioma, bronchogenic carcinoma and tuberculosis.  

Malignancy in asbestos-related disease
7000x increased incidence of mesothelioma; however, this equals a 10 % lifetime risk, >30yrs after exposure.
Other associated increase risks include 7x increase in bronchogenic carcinoma and 3x increase in gastrointestinal neoplasia.
