20 y/o intubated female trauma patient.
Intubated patients are at increased risk of mucous plugging due to decreased ciliary function, decreased cough reflex and increased secretions.  Acute lobar or whole lung collapse in an intubated patient should raise the suspicion of mucus plugging.  Suctioning or bronchoscopy usually results in improvement clinically and radiographically.
