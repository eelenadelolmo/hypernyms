The cell of orgin is the antigen presenting interdigitating cells in the paracortical regions of the lymph node. The pathological diagnosis is based on the presence of Reed Sternberg cells. Approximately 90% originate in the lymph nodes and 10% originate in extranodal lymphoid tissue or parenchymal organs. 

Types of Hodgkins's Lymphoma/Prognosis best to worst. Lymphocyte predominant > Nodular Sclerosiing > Mixed Cellularity > Lymphocyte Depleted. The most common type is Nodular Sclerosing. 

Incidence is 1:50,000. Bimodal age distribution with peaks in 30's and 70's years of age. 

Radiographic Features. 
-Superior and anterior mediastinal nodal involvement- 95%.       
-Contiguous progression from one lymph node group to the next. 
-Lung involvement - 15%       
-Pleural effusions - 15%
