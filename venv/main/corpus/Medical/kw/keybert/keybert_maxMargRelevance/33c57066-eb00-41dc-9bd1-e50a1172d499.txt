Clinical Manifestations:  Patients' with Bochdalek hernias typically present in infancy with pulmonary insufficiency.  In the neonate, Bochdalek's hernia is one of the leading causes of respiratory distress and is one of the most common congenital anomalies of the thorax.  Affected adults typically have no symptoms and are diagnosed incidentally on imaging studies.
-Treatment:   Neonate:  Surgical repair
Adult:  Usually none.
Radiologic findings:     
Bochdalek's hernia is seen as a posterolateral diaphragmatic interruption with the finding of fat herniating through the interruption above the diaphragm.  Other intraperitoneal and/or retroperitoneal structures can also be seen herniating through the diaphragmatic interruption.  Axial CT scan (with sagittal and/or coronal reformations occasionally) of the abdomen is commonly accepted as the best diagnostic test to evaluate for diaphragmatic hernias.  Fluoroscopic Upper GI/SBF studies are helpful in defining the extent of intestinal herniation if present, and to evaluate for possible malrotation or strangulation.
Bochdalek hernia
Differential Diagnosis:  Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: Bochdalek, Morgagni, Paraesophageal hernia through esophageal hiatus.  Traumatic diaphragmatic hernia.  Diaphragmatic eventration.
Known congenital right diaphragmatic hernia and occasional episodes of SOB, but normal PF tests. Request for assessment with UGI and SBFT was made to evaluate for evidence of malrotation and to determine the extent of herniated bowel within the thoracic cavity.
-Factoid Discussion:   Hernias through the foramen of Bochdalek are developmental defects in the posterior part of the diaphragm which contain omental fat and tissues, and additionally, often contain intraperitoneal and/or retroperitoneal structures.  Patients' with Bochdalek hernias typically present in infancy with pulmonary insufficiency.

-Etiology and Pathogenesis:  Congenital diapharagmatic hernias result from developmental failure of posterolateral diaphragmatic foramina to fuse properly.  Bochdalek hernias occur much more frequently on the left than on the right, presumably because the presence of the liver on the right prevents many Bochdalek hernias from occurring on that side.
