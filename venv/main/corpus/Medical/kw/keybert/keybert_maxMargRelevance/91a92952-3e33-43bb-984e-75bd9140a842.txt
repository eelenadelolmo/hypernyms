Pt is a 23 y/o AA female varsity athlete who presented initially with complaint of right foot pain.  No pertinent medical history.
This patient had two possible causes of her pain.  First, her stress fracture in the navicular bone can certainly cause pain.  Also, the presence of an accessory navicular bone could have provided an alternate source of attachment for the posterior tibial tendon.  The surgeon thought it was prudent to correct both possible areas to ensure no further problems in the future.
