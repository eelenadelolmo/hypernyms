Non-contributory.  Non-focal neuro exam.
Neurosurgery was consulted and patient underwent surgery with ventriculo-peritoneal shunt placement to alleviate pressure and to prevent any further complications.  

Endoscopic ventriculostomy is an alternative to the shunt surgery.
CT imaging without contrast showed ventricular enlargement of lateral and third ventricles with a normal fourth ventricle.  Subsequent MRI confirmed the CT findings without evidence of transependymal flow of CSF.  High resolution MRI demonstrated multiple thin septations in the aqueduct of Sylvius.

MR imaging with CINE CSF flow study (not depicted) showed no significant CSF flow through the cerebral aqueduct.
Non communicating hydrocephalus due to aqueductal stenosis
Communicating vs. Non-communicating Hydrocephalus
21 yr old pregnant female at 11 wks of gestation presents with two weeks history of severe headache.  She reports recent MVC one week prior to presentation to the ED.  Subsequently, she noted a remote history of salmonella meningitis as a child.
Hydrocephalus is defined as an active distension of the ventricular system due to inadequate passage of CSF from its point of production within the ventricular system to its point of absorption into the systemic circulation (2).  The incidence of hydrocephalus is equal in men and women.  However, there are a few exceptions such as an X-linked hydrocephalus and normal pressure hydrocephalus that is predominant in male patients.

This 21 yr old woman presented with headache and was diagnosed with aqueductal stenosis.  Headache is the most common clinical manifestation of an adult with aqueductal stenosis.  The signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus vary with age and disease progression.  A symptomatic adult patient could have additional neurological symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, blurred and double vision, gait impairment, drowsiness and cognitive deterioration.  Possible physical exam findings include those due to increased intracranial pressure such as papilledema, failure of upward gaze and accommodation, enlarged head, and gait instability(1).  

Based on the imaging findings, the patient suffered from chronic hydrocephalus because there was no significant transependymal flow of CSF or sulcal effacement .  Chronic hydrocephalus are typically due to congenital causes or longstanding processes, and this patient’s aqueductal septations are likely associated with post-inflammatory changes and sequelae of her childhood case of salmonella meningitis.  The incidence of chronic hydrocephalus increases with increasing age and clinical symptoms appear when hydrocephalus decompensates due to late onset of aqueductal stenosis (3,4).  

In order to relieve the pressure and improve patient’s clinical manifestation, this patient underwent VP shunt placement.  Currently, there are two forms of surgical treatment for aqueductal stenosis: shunt placement and endoscopic third ventriculostomy.  Shunt surgery remains the standard of care due to its effectiveness, but ETV experience is growing with improving patency rates and avoids shunt malfunction complications.  After obstruction is resolved, a patient’s gait, postural function, cognitive functions may improve (1).  This patient had complete resolution of headache.
