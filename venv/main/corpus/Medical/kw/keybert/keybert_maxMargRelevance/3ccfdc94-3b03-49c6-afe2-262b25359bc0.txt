Varicocele
42 active duty male with diffuse scrotal pain, progressive over the past 7 months.
This is an isolated left varicocele, the most common side for venous dilatation secondary to the long course of the left gonadal vein to the left renal vein.  If this had been an isolated varicocele on the right, further evaluation to exclude pelvic or retroperitoneal masses should be initiated as the right gonadal vein is shorter and empties directly into the distal inferior vena cava.
