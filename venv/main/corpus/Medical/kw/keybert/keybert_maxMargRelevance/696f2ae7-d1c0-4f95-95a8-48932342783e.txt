Imaging guided biopsy of the lesion was considered, and declined secondary to inaccessibility.  Patient will decide whether to undergo laproscopy.
Hypodense lesion in the tail of the pancreas, with cystic and soft tissue components.  Minimal pancreatic duct dilatation. There were no hepatic lesions, and all mesenteric and retroperiteoneal nodes were sub-centimeter.
Mucinous Cystic Neoplasm of the Pancreas
Mucinous Cystadenoma/Cystadenocarcinoma
Intraductal Papillary Tumor
Atypical pseudocyst
Patient recently had surgical repair of left inguinal hernia.  Pathology on the sac and surrounding soft tissue came back as "metastatic adenocarcinoma ".  Patient is otherwise healthy and asymptomatic.  CT was performed in a search for primary malignancy.
Finding of such markedly increased CA 19-9, along with pathologic evidence of metastatic disease nearly seal the diagnosis.  The mucinous cystic pancreas tumors favor the tail.   Ductal neoplasms tend to favor the head and body, and contain more soft tissue component.  Imaging features in this case are highly suggestive of the diagnosis. There is no surrounding inflammation to suggest pseudocyst.
