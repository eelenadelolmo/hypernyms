Isolated gastric pneumatosis is a very rare entity, and is most commonly seen with gastric or duodenal obstruction.  The more typical presentation of gastric pneumatosis is in association with more extensive pneumatosis intestinalis involving small and/or large bowel in patients with necrotizing enterocolitis.  However, this patient did not have additional areas of involvement.
