CT: 
Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver is seen.  Tortuosity and the development of additional vessels are present in the portal area. No portal vein thrombosis is seen.

U/S:
The liver is of increased diffuse echogenicity.  Multiple dilated and tortuous tubular-appearing structures are seen in the portal area. No normal portal vein is seen.  Color Doppler shows blood flow through these structures, consistent with periportal collateralization.
Cavernous transformation of the portal vein
57 yo female with several months of abdominal pain and bloating.  Left tubo-ovarian torsion resected 3 months prior.  Ultrasonography of the RUQ performed to assess mild elevation of transaminases.
Though cavernous transformation of the portal vein is usually a complication of portal vein thrombosis, none was seen in this patient.  She did have prior, somewhat chronic complaint of abdominal discomfort and bloating but no other underlying medical conditions.
