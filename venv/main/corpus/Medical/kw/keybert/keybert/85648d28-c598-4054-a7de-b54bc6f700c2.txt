The pts PE was unremarkable. The patient was well-developed with clear lung sounds. 
Laboratory tests were within normal limits.
Pt underwent primary closure for a small fistula.  The pt undergoes frequent barium swallows to evaluate for recurrent fistulas or strictures.  He is growing and developing normally.  He has no other associated abnormalities.
Lateral Projections of the barium swallow demonstrate a linear filling defect seen in the mid-esophagus, consistent with stricture.  There is a small amount of contrast seen exiting the esophagus anteriorly, just distal to the stricture and extending superiorly along the trachea.  These findings are consistent with a tracheoesophageal fistula, and confirmed by direct visualization at surgery.
