This patient has a history of achalasia and like most patients with this disorder, the esophagus contains a large amount of secretions.  Therefore the radiograph shows a rightward-displaced azygoesophageal interface.  Sometimes an air-fluid level can be discernable in these patients.  If the esophagus is filled with air rather than secretions, the radiographic finding will be that of a rightward-displaced azygoesophageal “stripe” instead of an interface.
