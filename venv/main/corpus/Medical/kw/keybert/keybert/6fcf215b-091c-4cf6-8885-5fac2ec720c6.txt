Reduced with air enema.
A paucity of gas is noted in the right lower quadrant on the upright view of the abdomen, and a mass-like protrusion is visualized within the inferomedial aspect of the cecum on the left lateral decubitus view of the abdomen.  Sequential fluoroscopic images demonstrate the introduction of air into the large bowel, clearly demonstrate the mass-like region of intussusception, and subsequent reduction of the intussusceptum, with gas entering the small bowel.
