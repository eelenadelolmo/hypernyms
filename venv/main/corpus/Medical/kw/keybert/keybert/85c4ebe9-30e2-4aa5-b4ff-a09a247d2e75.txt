Cold right lower leg
She was treated with fibrinolysis (Ukidan), PTA, and stenting
• the preliminary angiography shows occlusion of the common iliac right artery and the poplitea also.
• we proceeds, through iliac crossover, positioning a 4 F multihole straight catheter inside the iliac thrombus: bolus of 300.000 U. of Ukidan and beginning of fibrinolysis therapy with pomp infusion
• After 24 hs (60.000 U./h Ukidan) partial reopening of the vascular light: we proceeds to direct positioning a self expandable Stent [Memotherm] dilated with 10mm ball
• we proceed therefore to positioning another 4 F multihole straight catheter inside the popliteo thrombus: bolus of 300.000 U. of Ukidan and beginning of new fibrinolysis therapy with pomp infusion
• good final result after 48 hs
