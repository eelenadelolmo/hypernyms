71 year old male with mucosal rent during colonoscopy, admitted for observation.
Iatrogenic pneumoperitoneum or pneumoretroperitoneum from endoscopic procedures can occur.  Vigilance in assessing for extraluminal air is important.  Visualization of structures such as the falciform ligament and outlines of retroperitoneal structures such as the psoas and kidneys, as well as extraluminal air and pneumatosis, are important signs of extraluminal air.
