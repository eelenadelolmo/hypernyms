Mild scleral icterus present.  Abdomen tense with right upper quadrant tenderness and positive Murphyâ€™s sign.  Liver span 14cm in midclavicular line.  RUQ ultrasound shows a large mass with intermediate density in the posterior portion of the liver.WBC 21.8, Hbg 12.5, AST 271, ALT 384, Alk Phos 218, Total Bili 3.2, Negative blood cultures
The patient was treated with CT-guided percutaneous drainage of the large septated abscess with placement of an indwelling drainage catheter.  Only the largest abscess may need to be drained as smaller abscesses generally resolve with antibiotic treatment alone.  For a small abscess, antibiotic therapy without drainage may suffice. Biliary decompression is essential if the abscess is associated with biliary obstruction and may be accomplished through the endoscopic or transhepatic route.  Surgical drainage of the abscess may be necessary if percutaneous drainage is incomplete, jaundice does not resolve, renal function becomes impairmed, and in cases of multiloculated or ruptured abscesses.  Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics plus metronidazole to cover anaerobic organisms must be initiated.  If amebiasis is suspected, metronidazole therapy should be started before aspiration is performed. After culture results and sensitivity profiles have been obtained, antibiotic therapy directed at the specific organisms should be administered intravenously for 2 weeks and then orally for 6 weeks.  For streptococcal infections as in this case, the use of high-dose oral antibiotics for 6 months may be preferable.  Follow-up imaging, generally CT is recommended to ensure resolution of the abscess cavities.
Two lesions within the liver, the largest in the posterior right hepatic lobe measuring 9 x 9 cm and 12.5 cm in its maximal craniocaudad dimension with low signal on T1 weighted images.  The mass is heterogeneous and contains multiple internal septations with irregular internal walls.  The second lesion is within the medial segment of the left hepatic lobe measuring 3 x 3.5 cm and is without septations.  The biliary system is not dilated and the gallbladder is normal.
Pyogenic liver abscess
The most likely etiology is abscess (pyogenic or amebic).  Differential diagnosis also includes necrotic metastatic lesions, superinfected tumor, and less likely biliary cystadenoma/adenocarcinoma.
Three day history of fever to 104?F, malaise, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and right upper quadrant pain.
