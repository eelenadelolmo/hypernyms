This lesion is somewhat atypical in that no calcification was seen in the mass and no solid components.  The lesion is also larger than the typical craniopharyngioma.

The lack of clinical symptoms prior to the sudden loss of vision is also somewhat surprising in view of the very large size of the lesion.
