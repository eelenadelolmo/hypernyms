&#61548; Lab eval:
&#8211; Free T4 = 5.33 (H)
&#8211; TSH = 0.00 (L)
&#8211; Thyroid peroxidase = 10 IU/ml
TREATMENT
&#61548; Medical (anti-thyroid drugs)
&#61548; Surgical
&#61548; I131 Ablation:  Safe, effective, economical.  Complications include hypothyroidism (typical), radiation thyroiditis, rare thyroid storm.
&#61548; I131 dose:
&#8211; Usual dose varies depending on treating nuclear medicine physician's preference (i.e. standard dose versus dosage determination based on RAIU and estimated gland size)
FINDINGS
&#61548; 24 hr RAIU demonstrated elevated uptake of 37.5%.  Normal is 8-30%.
&#61548; Pertechnetate evaluation shows a moderately enlarged gland with homogeneous trapping of radiotracer.  No focal increased or decreased accumulation.
PROCEDURE
&#61548; Radiotracers:
&#8211; I131: T1/2 = 8 days, B- decay, Principal photon energy: 364 keV, Produced in a reactor.

&#8211; Pertechnetate: T1/2 = 6hr, Decay by isomeric transition, Principal photon energy: 140 KeV, Produced in a generator.

&#61548; 5 uCi of I131 is administered PO.
&#61548; Will concentrate in gland and the functional status can be determined.
&#61548; 24 hrs later, concentration in thyroid gland is determined using a single crystal counting probe and compared to an identical &#8220;standard&#8221; dose in a neck phantom.
&#61548; Correction for background activity is made and the following equation is used to determin % thyroid uptake:
&#61548; % uptake=Counts in neck-Counts in thigh  X 100
              divided by Counts in Standard

&#61548; To obtain thyroid gland morphology, 2-5 mCi of Tc Pertechnetate is administered IV.
&#61548; 20 min later the gland is imaged with a scintillation camera with pinhole collimator.
&#61548; Anterior, left and right anterior oblique images are acquired.
Graves Disease
CLINICAL SCENARIO
&#61548; 35 yr old female with clinical and biochemical thyrotoxicosis.  Symptoms of tachycardia, weight loss, nervousness, heat intolerance and possible exophthalmos.
&#61548; Positive family history of thyroid disease.
&#61548; Physical exam shows a moderately enlarged, nontender thyroid gland.
This patient received I131 ablation.
