To be determined
CECT of the brain demonstrates an approximately 2cm diameter well circumscribed, uniformly enhancing mass abutting the floor of the right anterior cranial fossa.  No other abnormalities are noted.

MRI of the brain demonstrates the same lesion to the right of midline causing mass effect on the frontal pole of the frontal lobe.  It is uniformly enhancing after administration of gadolinium, is well circumscribed, and isointense to gray matter on T1 and T2 weighted images.  FLAIR sequences demonstrate a small region of encephlomalachic changes posterior to the mass.  Noted on the coronal images is a broad-based dural tail.
Pending, but most likely a meningioma based on patient demographics, history and imaging characteristics.
