Texto: 
Oral course of metronidazole or vancomycin.
Diffuse bowel wall thickening of entire colon, demonstrating "accordion sign," (oral contrast trapped between markedly thickened haustral folds).  Pericolonic ascites and mild pericolonic stranding.
Pseudomembranous Colitis
Inflammatory colitis
Radiation enteritis
Hypoproteinemia
Leukemia/Lymphoma
Ischemic colitis
Bowel wall hemorrhage (Henoch-Schonlein disease)
Fever, abdomenal pain, leukocytosis, foul- smelling diarrhea after course of antibiotics for treatment of pneumonia.
In approximately half the cases of PMC, pancolitis will be present (not expected in ischemia, hemorrhage, inflammatory bowel disease).  Hypoproteinemia would show other hollow viscus thickening. Radiation enteritis would correspond to the radiated port. PMC is confirmed by stool assay for C. dificile toxin.  

CT findings do not necessarily correlate with clinical severity and negative CT findings do not exclude PMC, thus a high degree of clinical suspicion must be maintained since delayed diagnosis may be fatal.

The patient in the above example had a CT 2 weeks before the prior study, showing pneumonia, but normal appearance of bowel.  After development of PMC (presumably from antibiotic tx), she was treated with antibiotics (Flagyl), with significant improvement in clinical parameters, allowing discharge.
