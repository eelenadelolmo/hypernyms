Cholecystectomy and choledocojejunostomy
Both CT and MRI demonstrate dilated intrahepatic biliary ducts in the posterior right lobe of the liver.  Within the dilated system are several calculi that were formed secondary to chronic infection.
Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (a.k.a. oriental cholangitis or oriental cholangiohepatitis)
Biliary Cystadenoma or Cystadenocarcinoma 
Caroli Disease 
Cholangiocarcinoma 
Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis
AIDS Cholangitis
Choledochal Cyst 
Cholelithiasis 
Metastases
41 year old samoan woman presented with recurrent bouts of pancreatitis.
The most common location for recurrent pyogenic cholangitis is the left lateral lobe.  The second most common portion of the liver involved is the right posterior lobe as in this case.  It is interesting in this case that the dilated ducts are peripheral in location; Most case involve dilation of the secondary ducts leading to a "pruned tree" appearance to the biliary system.
