Texto: 
T2 hyperintense lesions in the upper thoracic and upper cervical spinal cord.  The lesions are isointense on T1 and on T1 with gadolinium.
Lupus Myelitis
Etiologies for transverse myelitis include multiple sclerosis, SLE, other connective tissue diseases, sarcoidosis, vasculitides, idiopathic, and post-infectious.
37 yo woman with systemic lupus erythematosus presents with progressive weakness and malaise.
This case is not radiographically unique for lupus myelitis, since the lesions are not greater than 2 vertebral bodies in length.  Given that the lesions do not enhance (and symptomatic cord lesions in MS typically do), MS is less likely.
