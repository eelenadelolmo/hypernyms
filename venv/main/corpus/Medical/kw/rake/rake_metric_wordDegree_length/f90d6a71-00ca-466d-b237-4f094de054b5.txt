Radiotherapy
CT scan plain neck - 
Axial cuts show a radio opaque mass arising from the right pyriform fossa, extending in to the post cricoid region.  The inlet of larynx seen to be occluded.
Squamous cell carcinoma moderately differentiated
â€¢ Squamous Cell Carcinoma
â€¢ Mixed Tumor (minor salivary gland)
â€¢ Lymphoma
70 y.o. man c/o 1) Difficulty in swallowing - 6 months; and, 2) Difficulty in breathing - 4 days.
This patient presented with the two cardinal symptoms of hypopharyngeal malignancy.
