Bronchoscopy is both diagnostic and theraputic.  It can be used in attempt to retract the calcified material from the bronchial lumen.
Plain film:  subtle calcifications adjacent to left hilum. 

CT:  multiple calcifications within the lumen of the left bronchus.
Broncholithiasis
The following can cause broncholithiasis:
   Histoplasmosis
   Tuberculosis
   Cryptococcosis
   Actinomycosis
   Silicosis
40 year-old male presented to emergency department as a trauma patient.  Routine trauma imaging was performed.
A broncholith occurs when a calcified lymph node erodes into an adjacent airway.  Symptoms may include hemoptysis, postobstructive atelectasis, or pneumonia.  On rare occasions, lithoptysis may occur (coughing up calcified material).  Reviewing old radiographs can aid in diagnosing a broncholith by observing calcified lymph nodes that have "disappeared" or changed location in the interim.  Fatalities have beem reported from pulmonary artery hemorrhage secondary to a broncholith.
