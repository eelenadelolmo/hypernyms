Physical exam of the left wrist reveals no abnormalities.
None indicated.
IMAGE ONE:

•This view of the patient's left forearm shortly after being casted is inadequate due to having only one view in addition to the artifact generated by the cast itself. However, a fracture is visible in the distal radial metaphysis extending into the distal physis.


IMAGE TWO:

•Possible positive ulnar variance. (Ulna is approximately 2mm longer than the radius)

•An ulnar avulsion is visible distal to the Ulnar process.

•Premature ossification of the lower radial epiphysis with the radial body. (Typically ossification occurs at the age of twenty.)
Salter-Harris Fracture Type II
Salter-Harris Fracture Type II
Patient is a 12 year-old girl who presents for follow-up to reassess a healed left forearm fracture. 

The patient's history is significant for a left forearm fracture obtained last year from falling on an outstretched hand. The patient's arm was evaluated and casted.
Salter-Harris fractures are injuries through the growth plate (physis). Therefore, by definition, they must occur before the physis closes. Typically, physis closure occurs during adolescence. The classification of Salter-Harris fractures is used to describe the extent and site of the epiphyseal injuries. The basic types of Salter-Harris fracture include the following:

Type 1
-Slipped 
-5% of all SHF 
-fracture plane passes all the way through the growth plate, not involving bone 
-good prognosis 

Type 2
-Above 
-75% (by far the most common) 
-fracture passes across most of the growth plate and through the metaphysis 
-good prognosis 

Type 3
-Lower 
-10% 
-fracture plane passes some distance along the growth plate and through the epiphysis 
-poor prognosis as the proliferative and reserve zones are interrupted.  

Type 4
-Through or Transverse or Together 
-10% 
-fracture plane passes directly through the metaphysis, growth plate and through the epiphysis 
-poor prognosis as the proliferative and reserve zones are interrupted.  

Type 5
-Ruined or Rammed 
-uncommon 
-crushing type injury does not displace the growth plate but damages it by direct compression 
-worst prognosis 

A USEFUL MNEMONIC: SALTR

S: Slipped, Type I
A: Above, Type II
L: Lower, Type III
T: Through, Type IV
R: Ruined, Type V

Although the patient is currently asymptomatic, she may be predisposed to a condition termed "Ulnar Impaction Syndrome."

UIS is a degenerative disorder of the wrist resulting from excessive load bearing on the ulnar aspect, highly associated with a positive ulnar variance. Patients experience ulnar-sided wrist pain, swelling, and limitation of motion. With chronic impaction of the ulnar head against the triangular fibrocartilage complex, progressive deterioration of the triangular fibrocartilage complex, chondromalacia of the lunate and head of the ulna, and attrition of the lunotriquetral interosseous ligament occur.
