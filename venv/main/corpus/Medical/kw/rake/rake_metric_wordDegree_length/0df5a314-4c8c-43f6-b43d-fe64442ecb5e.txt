Texto: 
Warmth and erythema over left ankle and write wrist. Limited ROM  of both joints secondary to arthralgia. No other physical abnormalities noted.

Joint aspirate  positive for needle shaped negatively birefringent crystals, wbc 30,000 with greater than 50% polys. Gram stain and culture negative
Colchicine 0.6mg qd for 7d with rheumatatology follow up.
Reduction in alcohol intake
Fronatl and lateral views of right wrist demonstrate cystic change in the scaphoid and in the hamate bones as well as, to a lesser extent, other carpal bones. Additionally, abnormal widening of the scapholunate space is present as well as abscence of the radioscaphoid joint space. These findings reflect scapholunate advanced collapse that may be related to the patient's gout. No osseous fracture. The visualized soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
Scapholunate advance collapse (SLAC) wrist
For arthritis:
Gouty arthritis
Rhumatoid athritis
Osteo arthritis
Infectious athritis

For wrist pain:
Scaphoid fracture
de quervain tenosynovitis
scapholunate dissociation
Kienbock disease
distal radial fracture
Preiser disease
scaphotrapezoid-trapezial (STT) joint arthritis
83 yo white male with extrensive h/o ETOH abuse admitted for detox.  PMH includes HTN, AFIB, DM. Pt experienced  gout attack  in his right wrist and left ankle during hospital course.
SLAC wrist pattern can result from various, radial-sided wrist pathologies most common of which is scapholunate dissociation with rotary subluxation of the scaphoid. Other etiologies include avascualr necrosis of the scaphoid (Preiser disease), intra articular fractures involving the radioscaphoid or capitate-lunate joints, midcarple instability, Kienbock disease, capitolunate degeneration, and as is most likely in this case, an inflammatory arthritis such as that from a crystalline deposition dissorder (ie gout).
