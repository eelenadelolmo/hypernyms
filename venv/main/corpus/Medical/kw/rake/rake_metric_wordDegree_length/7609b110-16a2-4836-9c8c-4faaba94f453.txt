This fracture complex is extremely difficult to treat and requires the skills of a very experienced surgeon.  ORIF, sometimes in stages, is required.

Wound infection complicates many cases because of the severe associated soft tissue injury.

The sequelae of this injury, even after successful treatment, are significant.  Many patients develop significant arthritis and loss of ankle function.
The medial malleolus, anterior, medial, posterior, and lateral portions of the distal tibial are fragmented separately from the level of the distal diaphyseal/metaphyseal junction to the intra-articular surface of the tibial plafond.  Between these fragments is a hematoma containing pulverized bone and bubbles of air. There is a complex comminuted facture of the distal fibula as well.  There is severe soft tissue injury and edema.  Air is seen in the soft tissues and an open wound is seen overlying the area of the lateral malleolus.

Parachuting injury
Although only images of the left proximal ankle are provided for review, this severe an injury would in all likelyhood be bilateral.  Associated injuries to L1, the pelvis, and the calcaneous may be present.
