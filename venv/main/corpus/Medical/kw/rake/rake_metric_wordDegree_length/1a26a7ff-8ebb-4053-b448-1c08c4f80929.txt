Heart evaluation reveals a regular rate with a 2/6 systolic murmur.
Distal pulses are normal.

Vital Sign Assessment:
â€¢ 	Systolic = 123  mm Hg
â€¢ 	Diastolic = 63  mm Hg
â€¢ 	BP Noninvasive Mean = 83  mm Hg
â€¢ 	Temperature = 99.9  degrees F
â€¢ 	Temperature = 37.7  degrees C
â€¢ 	Heart Rate = 79  
â€¢ 	Respiratory Rate = 24  
â€¢ 	Pulse Oximetry SpO2 (%) = 100

Lab results found to have mildly elevated troponin (0.16 ng/mL [normal range = 0 â€“ 0.04 ng/mL]), abnormal EKG with diffuse ST segment elevation and a right bundle branch block.
Patient is prescribed Atenolol 50 mg daily.

Patient is informed to perform no strenuous exercise such as competitive sports. He is given a Halter monitor x24 hours. A low cholesterol, high fiber, low salt, and low fat diet is recommended. The patient's risk of sudden cardiac death was calculated (see topic).  

He we considered to be at a relatively low risk of SCD and a decision to place him on medical treatment with Beta-blockers was made. AICD was not implanted.A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist was set for one month later.
ECHO: 

Summary:

1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: normal LVED with severe LVH, septum worse than posterior wall. No LV outflow obstruction at this time. Normal LV systolic function.
2. Prominent LV apical and posterior wall trabeculations.
3. Apparent tiny apical muscular ventricular septal defect with left to right shunting versus flow within RV apical trabeculations.
4. Trivial mitral regurgitation.
5. Poor subcostal acoustic windows. Cannot exclude a small atrial level shunt.
6. Trivial tricuspid regurgitation.
7. Normal right ventricular size and systolic function.
8. Widely patent aortic arch with no evidence of obstruction.
9. No pericardial effusion.

MRI:

Assymetrical left ventricular hypertrophy is present, preferentially involving the mid interventricular septum with a lesser degree of hypertrophy of the anterior wall and inferior wall. 
The maximal septal thickness measures 2.6 cm. The inferior lateral wall in comparison measures 7 mm.
Absolute myocardial mass is 301 grams. Indexed mass is 151 gm/m2 (Z score = 10.8) 
The left ventricle is mildly dilated (6.4 cm). The hypertrophied myocardial segments are hypocontractile. 
No left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. 
Normal left and right atrial size. The right ventricle has preserved contractility and function with no hypertrophy. 
Normal appearances of the pericardium without thickening or effusion.
There is normal mitral valve motion with no significant stenosis or regurgitation.
There is patchy myocardial delayed enhancement in the septum and anterior wall of the hypertrophied segments, likely indicating fibrosis in these areas.
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
Physiological Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (Athleteâ€™s Heart)
Pathophysiological Hypertrophy due to aortic stenosis or hypertension
Infiltrative heart muscle and storage disorders such as Fabryâ€™s Disease
17-year-old white male patient presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain radiating to his back. He also reported a several day history of chest discomfort, body aches and generalized malaise. He complained of chest discomfort, 

The patient had a strong family history of coronary artery disease. He had been diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 16.
