VS: P 120, RR 28, T 98.8, BP 115/80

CARDIAC: Tachycardia, no murmurs 
LUNG: no crackles
ABDOMEN: obvious entrance wound at left upper quadrant with rebound tenderness on initial assessment.
EXT: WNL
The patient underwent an Interventional Radiology procedure consisting of aortic angiogram and placement of four coils for embolization of the pseudoaneurysm.
There is a focal 1.3 x 1.0 cm false aneurysm from the abdominal aorta on the right side, just above the origin of the right renal artery. The patient is noted to be status post distal pancreatectomy, and splenectomy with a JP drain in place in the left upper quadrant. A bullet is seen over the right mid kidney and may be located within the renal collecting system.

This is a 24-year-old African-American male who is status post gunshot wound and repair, who was transferred from the ICU in stable condition s/p distal pancreas resection and repair of injured aorta and superior mesenteric artery. Shortly after transfer, the patient had some desaturations to the high 80s and some signs of respiratory compromise and underwent a CT angio to rule out a PE, which was negative. The CT showed some infiltrates in both lungs and a presumed diagnosis of pneumonia was made in conjunction with increasing white count. The patient was put on antibiotics but upon further examination by the Radiologist, a pseudoaneurysm of the aorta was discovered superior to the right renal artery.
