• Extensive left MCA infarct with restricted diffusion.
• Evidence of laminar necrosis of Basal Ganglia on T1 images.
• Scattered enhancement of cortical gray matter.
• Small cavernous carotid ICA, left.
• 90% stenosis left ICA origin on MRA - not shown here

43 year old woman presents with acute onset of right sided hemiparesis and aphasia
Laminar necrosis seen as hyperintensity on T1 images should not be confused with enhancement on Gadolinium enhanced images.  This T1 hyperintensity is usually not caused by hemorrhage. Siskas et al reported:
Histological examination has demonstrated these to be "cortical laminar necrosis", without hemorrhage or calcification. PMID: 12743663

Castillo et al consider this probably represents lipid-laden macrophages. PMID: 8966284
