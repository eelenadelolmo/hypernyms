Pleasant, high functioning elderly female without abnormal physical exam abnormalities.
PET/CT showed no evidence of metastasis. Multiple treatment options to include left lower lobectomy/wedge resection were considered.  However, given advanced age and low grade adenocarcinoma, the patient opted for definitive external beam irradiation.
1.2 x 1.4 cm left lower lobe ground glass pulmonary nodule without significant metabolic activity. Of note, chest CT one year prior showed correlating 1.0 cm pulmonary nodule.
Adenocarcinoma of the lung.
Infection/Inflammation: Atypical or early bacterial.
Tumor: Low grade (e.g., bronchioloalveolar) or well differentiated adenocarcinoma; mucinous tumors (e.g., bronchioloalveolar); carcinoid; mucoepidermoid carcinoma; adenoid cystic carcinoma; pleomorphic carcinoma. Most metastasis and lymphoma are unlikely given the lack of significant activity.
86 year old female with history of esophageal cancer status post esophagectomy presents with unexplained weight loss (30 pounds over past 2 years).  18-FDG PET/CT performed.
Though extremely valuable in the workup and evaluation of cancer patients, among several factors such as lesion size, F-18 FDG PET imaging is dependent on the enhanced glycolytic rate (aka metabolic activity) of malignant cells to demonstrate elevated SUVs.  Thus, many low grade or well-differentiated tumors will not demonstrate increased FDG avidity.  Classic examples include bronchoalveolar carcinoma (low grade adenocarcinoma) and carcinoid.  

At times, borderline elevated (above 2.5) SUVs can be seen in these tumors which further complicates specificity.  One strategum for differentiating infectious/inflammatory pulmonary lesions from tumor is dual-time point imaging, where a second more delayed PET is performed and compared with initial imaging.  Classically, infection/inflammation SUV decreases, and tumor SUV increases.  Alternatively, other PET radiopharmaceuticals can be used, such as C11 acetate, although these isotopes are still largely experimental, not routinely available, and only FDG is currently CMS approved.
