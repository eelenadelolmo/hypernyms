Leukokoria
This teenager was originally diagnosed at age 10 and has had two courses of laser therapy to the retina.  His vision has improved.
There is a yellow-white reflection of light from the back of the right eye.  This is classic leukokoria.
Coats Disease
Childhood leukokoria can be inflmmatory, neoplastic, toxic, or developmental:
Neoplastic:
Retinoblastoma

Toxocara canis
Developmental:

Coats Disease
Leukokoria noted in family photographs.  With questioning, progressive loss of visual acuity was reported.
Cases and images kindly provided by Dr. Frank Pessola of Somerset, PA. Thanks, Frank!
