FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

  A. PERICARDIAL ANGLE, LEFT, EXCISION:
      UNREMARKABLE FIBROVASCULAR TISSUE WITH IMMATURE FRAGMENTS OF CARTILAGE
      AND CALCIFICATIONS.

  B. THYMUS, RESECTION:
      THYMIC CYST WITH RESIDUAL UNREMARKABLE THYMUS AND MATURE ADIPOSE
      TISSUE.

  C. MEDIASTINAL TISSUE, EXCISION:
      SIX(6) BENIGN LYMPH NODES WITH ANTHRACOTIC PIGMENT.
Median sternotomy and excision of mass was performed.
Plain radiographs demonstrate a convexity along the right heart border.  Contrast enhanced CT demonstrates a well defined mass without peripheral enhancement.  There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.

Pericardial Cyst
Thymic Cyst

Duplication Cyst
66 year old African American female with incidental finding on an electron beam CT examination.  Patient had a remote history of breast cancer 18 years ago with a left mastectomy.
Thymic Cysts represent 1% of mediastinal masses.  Congenital forms are rare and arise from a patent thymopharyngeal duct.  Half of the congenital forms are discovered incidentally in the first two decades of life.  Acquired formes occur after radiation therapy for Hodgkin's Lymphoma, in association with thymic tumors and post thoracotomy.  

Thymic cysts can be multilocular.  These are secondary to an inflammatory process and seen in 1% of children who are HIV positive.  

CT findings in unilocular thymic cysts are fluid attenuation with imperceptable walls.  Multilocular thymic cysts are homogeneous or heterogeneous with a well defined wall.  Hemorrhage or infection can present as a solid mass secondary to high attenuation.
