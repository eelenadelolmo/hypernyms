Well elderly male with palpable gastric mass. 
CBC, chemistry, and coagulation panels all within normal limits. Heliobacter pylori positive.
Heliobacter pylori eradication, chemotherapy
•A long segment of the gastric wall lesser curvature is asymmetrically thickened to 23mm. The fat plane between the liver and the stomach appears to be preserved.  
•Additional findings not shown in selected image: A 9 mm lymph node is present between the stomach and the liver. An 11mm pancreatic node is seen.  
• The liver, spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. A 3.2 cm simple cyst is seen in the superior pole of the right kidney. The left kidney is unremarkable.
Gastric MALT Lymphoma, poorly differentiated
• Adenocarcinoma
• Gastric lymphoma
• Metastatic disease
• Gastritis
75 y/o man with a history of chronic active gastritis and refractory gastric ulcer.  A 6 cm by 6 cm gastric mass found on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).
Gastric MALT lymphoma is associated with H Pylori infection. While eradication of H Pylori is often (60-75%) sufficient to effect remission, higher grade lesions, as evidenced by the lesion's histopathology require additional chemotherapy. This patient achieved full remission.
