Texto: 
Bilateral locked facets of C5/6 resulted in almost complete quadriplegia with only minimal motor residual to left arm.  The sensory loss was from T2 down.  It is very unlikely that the patient will recover any motor or sensory deficits.

Locked facets were almost completely reduced by applying cervical traction.  The patient was then taken to surgery for vertebral fusion with bone graft (from pelvis).

After recovery from surgery, patient was transferred to a rehabilitation center.
More than 50% anterior subluxation of C5 on C6 with bilateral locked facets.
Bilateral jumped locked facets
33 year old woman was sitting on the trampoline while another person was bouncing on it.  She was thrown into the air about 1 foot and was hyperflexed on landing.
It is important to consider the neurologic status and evaluate the spinal cord with MR if there are signs of cord compression.
