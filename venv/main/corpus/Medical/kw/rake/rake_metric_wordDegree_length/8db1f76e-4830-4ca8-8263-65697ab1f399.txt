Surgical excision is the treatment of choice.  Complications of untreated ovarian dermoid cysts include torsion, rupture, infection, and malignant transformation in 2%.
Ultrasound:  Heterogeneous and hyperechoic mass in the left adnexa.  

CT:  Well circumscribed mass adjacent to the uterus with a low attenuation center (Hounsfield Units consistent with fat) and small nodular component along its medial wall.  Additionally there is intermediate soft tissue density along the medial wall of the lesion.

MRI:  Left adnexal lesion with high signal intensity on the T1 weighted spoiled gradient images.  On the T2 weighted images, the lesion has homogenous increased signal intensity.  Along the medial wall of the lesion, there is as crescentic cystic component with high T2 signal and low T1 signal.  On the fat saturated images, the majority of the high T1 and T2 signal drops out consistent with fat.  There are also some scattered foci of high signal intensity within the legion on the fat saturated images.

A characteristic structural feature of most cystic teratomas is the dermoid plug or Rokitansky plug.  The dermoid plug consists of a mixture of sebaceous material, fat, hair, and soft tissue that produces a highly echogenic, amorphous, nodular focus with dirty acoustic shadowing.  This appearance is called the tip of the iceburg sign.  The ultrasound images in this case showed a heteroechoic and echogenic mass; however, dirty acoustic shadowing from a Rokitansky plug was not clearly visualized.  The fat within this mass on MRI imaging really helped to clinch the diagnosis though.  A dermoid cyst was highly suspected based on its ultrasound characteristics.  The CT images also helped with the presence of an intramural nodule (likely Rokitansky plug) and Hounsfield units consistent with fat.
