physical exam is unknown.  Final pathology showed a 5 cm lesion, yellow-orange and pink/tan mass with cystic areas.  Additonal areas of hemorrhage and necrosis.  The lesion extends to but not through the renal capsule.
Surgical removal of the right kidney.  Obstruction of the left ureter was releved with stenting.
Within the right kidney, upper pole, there is a large heterogenious mass with areas of increased density and areas of necrosis.  The left kidney is enlarged moderately and the renal pelvis is somewhat dilated.  The left ureter demonstrates an obstructing stone.
Renal Cell Carcinoma, clear cell type.
