physical exam is unknown.  Final pathology showed a 5 cm lesion, yellow-orange and pink/tan mass with cystic areas.  Additonal areas of hemorrhage and necrosis.  The lesion extends to but not through the renal capsule.
Surgical removal of the right kidney.  Obstruction of the left ureter was releved with stenting.
Within the right kidney, upper pole, there is a large heterogenious mass with areas of increased density and areas of necrosis.  The left kidney is enlarged moderately and the renal pelvis is somewhat dilated.  The left ureter demonstrates an obstructing stone.
Renal Cell Carcinoma, clear cell type.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
Complicated hemorrhagic cyst
Metastatic disease
35 year old male presented initially with painless, gross hematuria.  Acute presentation at the time of CT was with left flank pain.
This lesion was confined to the right kidney and did not extend to through the cpasule.  This represents Stage 1, TNM staging pT1bNxMx.
