Boggy swelling over left forehead.  Doughy on palpation, anterior table of frontal bone eroded.  Proptosis of left eye was seen.  Ocular movements complete.  Vision normal.  Ears / Nose / Throat - No significant findings.
After surgery, patient was treated with antibiotics for 1 week.  Regular anti diabetic drugs were started.
CT scan Coronal section of para nasal sinuses showed expansile lesion involving the left frontal sinus with erosion of the inner and outer tables of frontal bone.  Left eye showed proptosis with intact orbital walls.
Frontoethmoidal mucocele, intracranial extension
â€¢ Malignancy of the frontal sinus
â€¢ Frontal mucocele
â€¢ Fungal sinusitis
60 year old woman with complaints of swelling over left forehead and protrusion of left eye ball of 10 years duration.  Patient is a known diabetic on irregular treatment.
Frontal mucocele is caused due to obstruction (long standing) of frontal sinus ostium.  This obstruction leads to pent up secretions which expands the frontal sinus.  It also led to erosion of the outer and inner tables of frontal sinus.
