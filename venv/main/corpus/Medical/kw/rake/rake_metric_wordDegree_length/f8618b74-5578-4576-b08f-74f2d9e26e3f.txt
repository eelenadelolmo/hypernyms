Texto: 
Soft, fluctuant, non-tender midline mass, just above the nose. Exam otherwise unremarkable.
Surgical reduction of the tissue, with placement of a dural patch over the defect (it is not excised!).
CT: Non-contrast CT demonstrates an extranasal soft tissue mass, contiguous with the frontal lobe, extending through an anterior cranial midline defect just above the nasal bones (fonticulus nasofrontalis).

MR: There is an extranasal soft tissue mass is continuous with the frontal lobe, iso-intense to normal brain parenchyma on T1WI, slightly higher in signal compared with normal brain parenchyma on T2WI. There is no enhancement with gadolinium.

Congenital lesions of the sinonasal cavity represent anomalies of invagination of the neural plate. In both encephaloceles and nasal gliomas, brain tissue becomes “trapped” by closing bony growth plates (more precisely, it is a failure of adequate regression of the dermal connection).  Encephaloceles maintain a CSF connection to the brain. They are categorized as extranasal (frontonasal) if they extend through the fonticulus nasofrontalis, and intranasal if they extend through the ethmoidal plate (nasoethmoidal). The isolated non-functional neuronal matter is isointense to brain on CT. On MR it is iso- to hypointense on T1 weighted images and hyperintense on T2 weighted images secondary to gliosis, but lacks contrast enhancement. Encephaloceles are associated with other craniofacial abnormalities and anomalies of the corpus callosum.

Nasal gliomas are not true glial tumors. They are similar to encephaloceles in that they represent isolated neuronal matter to due failures in regression during development, but the connection to the intracranial contents is limited to a fibrous band. They too are classified as intra- or extranasal. Interestingly, extranasal gliomas are neither truly nasal nor truly gliomas.

Dermoid cysts represent trapped ecto- and mesoderm.  The patient often has a pit in the middle of the nose. An intracranial connection is maintained in 25% of lesions, placing the patient at risk for osteomyelitis, meningitis and cerebral abscess should they become infected. Sinus tracts maintain a connection to a dermoid cyst, and uncommonly to the brain. 

This case represents a frontonasal encephalocele. The bony defect (fonticulus nasofrontalis) is best visualized on CT. MR confirms a connection to the brain parenchyma, with typical findings of gliosis but not enhancement in the non-functioning neuronal tissue.
