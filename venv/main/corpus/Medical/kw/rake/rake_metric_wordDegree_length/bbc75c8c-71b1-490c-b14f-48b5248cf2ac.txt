AP radiographs of the left hip show a geographic lesion with a thin, well-defined sclerotic margin in the intertrochanteric region of the femur. There is globular amorphous mineralized matrix in the middle lower portion of the lesion, with more extensively mineralized globular matrix in the upper aspect.

Axial CT scan through the middle portion of the lesion shows the mineralized matrix. The attenuation of the lesion is greater than that of marrow fat and less than that of skeletal muscle.
Liposclerosing Myxofibrous Tumor of Bone (LSMFT)
1. Fibrous dysplasia
2. Fibroxanthoma 
3. Myxofibroma
4. Lipoma
5. Cyst
6. Bone infarct
7. Paget's disease
8. Chondroma
40 y/o male with hip pain.
LSMFT has a predilection for the proximal femur at the intertrochanteric region - as was seen in this case.  More than 90% of these femoral lesions occur here.

Radiographs showed a well-defined, sclerotic margin. The bone contour showed mild expansile remodeling. Mineralization within the lesion was apparent.  Findings at computed tomography reflected those at radiography.
