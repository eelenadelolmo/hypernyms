Texto: 
Asymptomatic.  Initial labs (CBC/Chem) WNL.
Patient is scheduled for lesion resection in August 2004.
PA/Lat CXR:  There is irregularity to the contour of the right hilum on the PA view.  On the lateral view, there is a central, RML nodule which when going back to the PA, can barely be seen.

Axial CT:  Note the round, smooth nodule just anterior to the takeoff of the medial RML bronchus.  There is no calcification, and no strong enhancement with intravenous contrast.  The lesion does not appear to involve the bronchial lumen.  

Coronal CT reformation:  Round nodule superior to the RML bronchus again demonstrated.

66yo asymptomatic female with significant past smoking history and abnormal, incidental chest finding on routine EBCT.
The location of this lesion is somewhat more peripheral than is usually seen with typical carcinoids.  This carcinoid is also "atypical" in that it does not enhance, and is not calcified.  The pathology, however, was consistent with a low-grade (typical) bronchial carcinoid.  This patient fell into the 25% of patients who present asymptomatically with the lesion as an incidental finding on another study, which in this case was an EBCT.
