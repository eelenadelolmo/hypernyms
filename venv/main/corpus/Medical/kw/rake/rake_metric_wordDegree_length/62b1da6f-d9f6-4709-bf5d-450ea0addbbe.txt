AP view of the pelvis demonstrating a lytic lesion within the right ilium just superior to the acetabulum.  This lytic lesion has a wide zone of transition.  No periosteal reaction is seen.

Axial CT in soft tissue windows shows the lytic right iliac lesion with associated large soft tissue mass underlying the gluteal muscles.  The soft tissue component is heterogeneous with some very dense areas suggesting calcification.

Axial T2WI demonstrates the heterogeneous but predominantly high T2 signal within the osseous and soft tissue mass.
Chondroblastic Osteosarcoma
Ewing's Sarcoma 
Chondrosarcoma
13 year old girl presents with non-specific right hip pain.
The differential diagnosis includes chondrosarcoma and Ewing‚Äôs sarcoma, especially in this age group and location.  In regards to location, the cases of chondroblastic osteosarcoma reported in literature are mainly found in the mandible (gnathic osteosarcoma) and in the femur or tibia (presumed periosteal osteosarcoma).  There are few if any reported cases of primary chondroblastic osteosarcoma arising from the iliac bone.  

Pathologically, an osteosarcoma is defined as any tumor that contains neoplastic osteoid and/or woven bone formed from non-cartilaginous stroma, no matter how meager the osseous component is.  This is because in addition to osteoid and bone, the tumor cells of osteosarcoma may produce cartilage, fibrous tissue, or mixoid tissue.  However the ‚Äúchondroblastic‚Äù designation is not given unless more than 90% of the tissue is cartilaginous.  Although this case represents an unusual location for chondroblastic osteosarcoma, the histopathological diagnosis was confirmed by both the AFIP and Mayo Clinic.
