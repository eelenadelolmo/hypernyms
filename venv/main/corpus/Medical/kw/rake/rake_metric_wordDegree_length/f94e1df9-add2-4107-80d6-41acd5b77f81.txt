By report, physical exam was unremarkable.  No laboratory analysis was available.  Patient was subsequently Medevaced to the US based on findings on CXR.
Patient has undergone orchiectomy.  Additional treatment is likely to include platinum-based chemotherapy.
CXR demonstrates numerous "cannonball" masses within both lungs.  Initial CT of the ab/pelv performed overseas (currently unavailable) demonstrated an approximately 10 cm soft tissue density mass encasing the abdominal aorta and vena cava, presumably massive paraortic lymphadenopathy.  Scrotal US demonstrates a heterogeneous mass with areas of calcification in the right testis.
Metastatic testicular neoplasm, most likely choriocarcinoma or mixed NSGCT
Metastatic CA, testicular primary
Metastatic CA, with met to testicle
Lymphoma
31 yo active duty male deployed to the Middle East presented to his General Medical Officer with complaint of hemoptysis.
Choriocarcinoma accounts for only 0.5% of primary testicular neoplasm, but up to 23% of mixed NSGCT will contain a component of choriocarcinoma.  Patients with choriocarcinoma often have symptoms related to hemorrhagic metastases, as this patient with hemoptysis.
