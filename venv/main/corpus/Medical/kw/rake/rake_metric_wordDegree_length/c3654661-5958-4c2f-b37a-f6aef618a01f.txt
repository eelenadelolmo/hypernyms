Texto: 
Healthy active 59 year old female with a history of running. Osteoarthropathy of the knees was clinically suspected.
The patient will undergo a right total knee replacement. The lesion will be completely excised and will be sent to pathology to exclude a low grade chondrosarcoma.
Plain films showed a large lesion in the proximal right tibia. The matrix appeared chondroid with arcs and swirls. There was no fracture or soft tissue mass. MRI conformed a 6 cm lesion in the medullary space of the proximal right tibia with high T2SI and low T1 AND T2 regions which corresponded to the arcs and swirls seen on the plaun films. There was mild endosteal scalloping, but no cortical breakthrough or soft tissue mass.
Enchondroma (pathology pending)
Enchondroma vs. low grade chondrosarcoma
59 year old female with bilateral knee pain with activity.
TH epatients pain was presumedly due to osteoarthropathy, and not due to the lesion in her proximal tibia, making this likely an incidental finding which, however, will need to be addressed in pre operative planning for her total knee replacement.
