Afebrile, normotensive, normal heart rate
Gen- Moderate distress
CV/Pulm- normal
Abd- soft, no rebound or guarding

CBC,CMP,Amylase,Lipase- normal
KUB- Normal
A dedicated pancreatic CT was performed to look for a pancreatic mass, and no mass was seen.  GI was consulted and and an ERCP was performed.  CBD brush washings were normal and papillary stenosis was comfirmed.  The patient's abdominal pain resolved and she was discharged to home.
Gross intra and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilitaion.  Although no discrete pancreatic mass is appreciated, it cannot be definitively excluded.  The common bile duct measures 
2.5 x 3 cm at the porta hepatus.
Papillary Stenosis
Primary causes including congential malformations vs secondary causes such as a periampullary neoplasm, repeated bouts of pancreatitis, CBD manipulation or pancreatic divisum.
89 year old female with history of pancreatitis presents to the ED with 10/10 mid-epigastric abdominal pain.  Pain is non-radiating, stabbing, with no aggravating or alleviating factors.  No vomiting, diarrhea, melena, or hematochezia.  Complained of 10 lb weight loss and decreased appetite over the past several months.
This patient's papillary stenosis was likely due to repeated bouts of pancreatitis leading to scarring and stenosis of the common bile duct.  With the patient's recent weight loss a pancreatic mass was also a possibilty.  The pancreatic CT and normal CBD brush washings ruled out cancer as the cause of her stenosis.
