Enlarged, tender and erythematous right scrotum.
Evacuation of hematoma and repair of tunica albuginea.
Disrupted inferior testicular contour (tunica albuginea) and heterogenous mass extending from a linear lucent area at this level into the inferior right hemiscrotum.
Testicle fracture
Testicular rupture.
Hematoma without rupture.
Testicular trauma with underlying testicular neoplasm.
