To help prevent sickle cell crises, patients should attempt to avoid strenuous physical activity and environments with low oxygen content such as high altitudes or non-pressurized aircraft.   Patients should stay well hydrated and avoid sources of infection as much as possible.  Immunizations should be up to date and the diet should be supplemented with folic acid.  During sickle crisis, analgesics and adequate fluid intake are imperative.  Long-term follow up and management of complications from the disease is imperative.  In the past, death from organ failure and infection often occurred between the ages of 20 and 40.  Now, patients live into their 40’s and 50’s due to better understanding and management of the disease.
Lateral X-ray of the chest demonstrates vertebral body end plates with a concave contour and central lucencies.  These finding’s depict an “H” shaped or “Lincoln Log” appearance.

Lateral X-ray of the left femur demontrates relative densities within the midshaft of the femur demonstrating a "bone within a bone" appearance.  The patchy increase in density results from bone infarcts due to sickle cell disease.

On the T2 Inversion Recovery Coronal image, distinct abnormal bone marrow signal is seen within the diaphyses and metaphyses of both femurs.  The abnormal signal consists of a peripheral low signal intensity rim with an adjacent inner rim of increased signal intensity termed the "double rim" sign.

Patient presented complaining of severe joint pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
This patient demonstrates many of the classic radiographic signs of sickle cell disease.  The depressions seen in the central portions of this patient’s vertebral bodies produce a “Lincoln Log” appearance.  These findings have been considered a pathognomonic sign of sickle cell disease; however, similar changes have been observed in other hemoglobinopathies as well.  The vertebral bodies have a smooth concavity along the end plates which is thought to be caused by demineralization secondary to marrow hyperplasia.  Additionally, the opposing end plate depressions demonstrated in this case are believed to be the result of focal fractures in the weakened bone from the marrow hyperplasia and vascular occlusions caused by sickling red blood cells.
This patient complained of left femur pain.  His lateral radiograph demonstrated increased density within the medullary bone which is the result of bone infarction.  Bone infarction is common in sickle cell patients due to the occlusions caused by the abnormal red blood cells.  The radiographic findings suggesting bone infarcts within the left femur were confirmed by MRI.  The T2 Inversion Recovery Coronal image shows signs of avascular necrosis in both femurs.  The MRI image shows the  “double rim” sign which is classic for avascular necrosis.  The bone demonstrates a rim of decreased signal intensity with a central region of increased signal intensity on T2 imaging.
