There is a lobulated mass at the palmar aspect of the left index finger. The mass measures 1.2 cm long x 6 mm in dorsal-palmar plane x 1.4 cm in greatest width. The mass shows intermediate T1, heterogeneous but predominantly low T2 signal and heterogeneous enhancement on the T1 postgadolinium sequences. No bone erosion.
Giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath
Giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath and much less likely, malignant fibrous histocytoma or fibromatosis
53 yo male with left index finger mass for greater than 1 year
