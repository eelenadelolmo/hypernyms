Left tongue fasciculations and deviation of the tongue to the left upon protrusion.
The patient underwent posterolateral transcondylar resection of the chordoma, C1 laminectomy and C1-C2 interlaminar fusion. He was then treated with 79 Gy in 66 fractions with 5 field IMRT at 6 MV photon energy over a period of six weeks. Follow up examinations were without cranial nerve deficit and the patientâ€™s dysarthria improved.
On CT an expansile mass without matrix was seen replacing the inferior clivus.  No obvious anterior extension beyond the clivus was seen.  The odontoid appeared eroded and the spinal canal at C1-C2 was widened.

The MRI without and with contrast showed a mass replacing the inferior clivus, compressing the cervicomedullary junction.  The mass was homogenously hyperintense on T2WI, homogeneously slightly hyperintense on T1WI, with minimal heterogeneous enhancement.  The mass did not extend anterior to the clivus. The most caudal extent of the mass was to the C2-3 disk space.  No other sites of enhancement were seen on post-gadolinium images.  MRA showed patent vertebral arteries.
