Negative HCG
"Fetal hand and spine" seen on ultrasound performed by Emergency room physician.
The patient was transfered to another facility where she underwent right oopherectomy.
US:  Large heterogeneous predominantly cystic mass with solid components within the pelvis.  The ovaries were not definitely seen.  This mass likely arises from one of the ovaries.  The uterus was identified and not enlarged.  There is no free fluid within the abdomen.  

CT:  There is a large pelvic mass extending up into the abdomen.  Largest transverse dimension is19 cm.  It is predominantly fluid in density with scattered areas of soft tissue, fat and calcium throughout.  This is most consistent with a teratoma.  No definite free fluid is noted within the pelvis.  The uterus is somewhat compressed by the mass, but otherwise unremarkable.  There is limited visualization of the left ovary.  The right ovary is not identified.
