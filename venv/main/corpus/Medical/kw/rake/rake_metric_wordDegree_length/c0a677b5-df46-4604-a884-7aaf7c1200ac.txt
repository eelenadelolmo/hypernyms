Functioning nodules in the upper and lower poles of the right lobe of the thyroid, with two functioning nodules (difficult to differentiate on the provided image) in the region of the middle pole of the left lobe.  There is a large hypofunctioning nodule in the middle pole of the right lobe (also noted as a distinct nodule on ultrasound).  Additionally, the thyroid to background counts ratio is markedly increased.
