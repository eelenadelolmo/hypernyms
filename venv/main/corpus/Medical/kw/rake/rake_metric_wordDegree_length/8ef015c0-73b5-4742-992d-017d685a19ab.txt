Relative to the cervical and upper extremities the following exam was performed initially:  She is 5’7” tall and weighs 330 lbs.  Blood pressure of the left arm in the seated position was 138/86mmHg.  

Active range of motion of the cervical spine revealed flexion to be accomplished to 40o/50o, right rotation to 40o/80o, left rotation to 40o/80o, left lateral bending to 25o/45o, right lateral bending to 25o/45o and extension to 25o/60o.  She reported neck pain extending to the left shoulder during left lateral bending.  During extension she reported tightness and pain in the neck.  

The bicep reflexes were graded 1/4 bilaterally.  The triceps reflex was graded 2/4 on the left and 1/4 on the right.  Cervical distraction was unremarkable.  Cervical compression testing produced report of neck pain extending down the left upper extremity to the fingers.  Active range of motion of the shoulders was within normal limits.  Muscle strengths of the upper extremities was within normal limits bilaterally.  Grip strength was tested using a Jamar dynamometer. The right hand tested to 70 lbs and the left hand tested 45 lbs.  He reports being right hand dominant.   

General exam significant for obesity.

18 months later the the Neurologist performed an ophthalmic exam which  revealed bilateral optic disc swelling, while visual fields and extraocular motility were intact.

Following computerized Range of Motion evaluation of the cervical spine within a month of this publication:  Active range of motion of the cervical spine was performed. During flexion, extension, and left lateral bending patient denied having neck pain as well as upper extremity pain. During left and right rotation patient reported increased neck pain extending into the bilateral shoulders. During right lateral bending patient reported increased right neck pain into the right shoulder. 

ALGOMETRY: 
Hyperalgesia was noted in the left levator scapula, left deltoid, & left/right lumbar paraspinals (2 finger width from midline, L4 level) to algometry testing. 
Fischer AA. Pressure algometry over normal muscles.  Standard values, validity and reproducibility of pressure threshold.  Pain 1987;30:115-26.

EMG studies of the upper and lower extremities did not reveal radiculopathy.
Following the results of the ophthalmic exam, CT scan of brain showed no mass lesion and a lumbar puncture was performed. The lumbar puncture had an opening pressure of 40cmH2O. Upper limit of normal for opening pressure is 25cmH2O, and this increased intracranial pressure resulted in the diagnosis of papilledema with pseudotumor cerebri.  The patient was started on acetazolamide 250mg qd, increased gradually to 2 bid over a month. Medication course was over 3 months. The lumbar puncture itself was therapeutic with a closing pressure of 19cmH2O. CSF studies returned with no abnormalities. Patient was counseled on weight control, including physical activity and diet. She was advised that controlling her body weight could help or even resolve her condition. She was referred and followed by both ophthalmology and neurology with documented ophthalmic exams every 4 weeks. At the end of 3 months follow up ophthalmic exam revealed resolution of papilledema.
Cervical MRI one month following the MVA: Alignment of the cervical vertebrae is maintained in neutral sagittal imaging.  No instability is demonstrated on sagittal flexion and extension imaging.  Disc spaces are relatively maintained.  There is no evidence for focal marrow replacement or marrow edema of the cervical vertebrae.  A hemangioma is noted at the C4 vertebral body. The craniocervical junction is unremarkable.  There is no evidence for focal abnormal signal or focal expansion of the cervical spinal cord.

C2-3:  There is no evidence for central canal or foraminal stenosis.  No significant intervertebral disc pathology is evident.

C3-4:  There is no evidence for central canal or foraminal stenosis.  No significant intervertebral disc pathology is evident.

C4-5: There is no evidence for central canal or foraminal stenosis.  No significant intervertebral disc pathology is evident.

C5-6:  There is no evidence for central canal or right sided foraminal stenosis.  A minimal degree of left sided foraminal stenosis is noted secondary to asymmetric uncovertebral and facet joint degenerative changes.

C6-7:  There is no evidence for central canal or foraminal stenosis.  No significant intervertebral disc pathology is evident.

C7-T1:  There is no evidence for central canal or foraminal stenosis.  No significant intervertebral disc pathology is evident.

No significant accentuation of intervertebral disc pathology is noted upon sagittal flexion and extension imaging.  

IMPRESSION:  

1.	C5-6:  THERE IS NO EVIDENCE FOR CENTRAL CANAL OR RIGHT SIDED FORAMINAL STENOSIS.  A MINIMAL DEGREE OF LEFT SIDED FORAMINAL STENOSIS IS NOTED SECONDARY TO ASYMMETRIC UNCOVERTEBRAL AND FACET JOINT DEGENERATIVE CHANGES.
2.	THESE FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH PHASE I- II PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF THE CHIROPRACTIC CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OF VERTEBRAL SUBLUXATION COMPLEX.  CLINICAL CORRELATION IS RECOMMENDED. 
3.	IF FURTHER EVALUATION OF RADICULAR SYMPTOMS OR FORAMINAL PATHOLOGY IS REQUIRED CORRELATION WITH EMG AND/OR NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES WOULD BE HELPFUL. 

Stereo color photographs of the optic discs showed circumferential swelling of the optic discs, with some obscuration of major vessels as they exit the disc. These were consistent with Frisen stage III - IV papilledema.

CT of the orbits with and without contrast was unremarkable.

CT of the brain with and without contrast was read as a normal study.

27 year old white female, (Licensed Practical Nurse) with a history of MVA presented to the chiropractic office 6 days after the episode.    She was the belted driver of a moving vehicle with her seat belt attached when another vehicle struck the vehicle she was in on the passenger side in a T-Bone manner.

She reports being diagnosed prior to the MVA with: Fibromyalgia, Rheumatoid Arthritis, bipolar disorder, IBS and migraines. Additional history significant for hospitalizations for depression, Zanaflex overdose, and morphine overdose.  She reports taking the following medications prior to the MVA: Oxycodone 5mg, Oxycontin 10mg, Neurontin 300mg, Lexapro 40mg, Klonopin 1mg, Predisone 5mg, Seroquel XR 300 mg, Abilify 30mg, Methocarbamol 75mg, Vynase 50 mg, Motrin 800 mg and Pro-Air Inhaler. 

She had been having headaches and migraines since her MVA, but notes recent headaches being different from her usual migraines, being localized to her bifrontal and retroorbital regions. The headache was constant and described as a pressure pushing from behind her eyes. She reported her other chronic conditions as being managed and unchanged.  Approaching 18 months later she reported blurry vision. 

Current Medications: 
Sumatriptan 100mg 1 tab PRN headache, Geodon 60mg 2 caps qd, Deplin 15mg 1 cap qd, Neurontin 300mg 1 cap tid, Klonipin 1mg 1 tab qd, Celexa 20mg 1 ½ tabs qd, Linzess 145mcg 1 cap qd, prednisone 5mg 1 tab qd, Bentyl 10mg 2 caps PRN, Zanaflex 4 mg 2 tabs Q8H, tramadol 50 mg 1 tab Q6H, Protonix 40mg 1 tab qd, Detrol 4mg 1 cap qd, Imuran as directed

Allergies: Levoquin

On her second visit for chiropractic care (8 days after the accident), she reported that she had consulted her PCP, was sent to a neurologist for pain management and had an appointment with her rheumatolgoist that she had seen prior to the accident.  Within a month she found herself to be constipated and was going to her OBGYN for evaluation.  She then reports going to a urologist for further evaluation within 2 months following the MVA.  Due to neck pain and discomfort radiating to the shoulders she was sent for MRI of the cervical spine by her chiropractor.   Approximately, 3 months after the MVA she does report increased depression as a result of her injuries and indicates increased headache symptoms. She was referred by her treating doctor of chiropractic who acted as the primary care doctor for the MVA case to: Another pain management specialist as she preferred another, an orthopedic surgeon, another neurologist, a neuropsychiatrist, massage therapist and for electrodiagnositic evaluation.  She had her first prolotherapy treatment from the physiatric specialist 7 months following the MVA which then continued on a 1X/month basis to the neck.   The Neuropsychiatrist diagnosed PTSD from the MVA, prescribed Giodon.  Such prescription was approximately one year following the MVA which helped and later he increased the dosage of such.  She also went to a counselor for her condition.   About 9-10 months after the MVA she reports applying for SSD and 13 months following the MVA was denied SSD.  The Neuropsychiatrist then added Celexa to her medications approximately 15 months post-MVA.  Approximately, 18 months after the MVA she was then diagnosed as having increased CSF pressure causing her to have headaches.   She was then referred by the neurologist to an Ophthamologist who performed fundoscopic evaluation.  From there she was referred to a hospital to perform spinal tap evaluation.  The time period between the diagnosis by the opthamologist for spinal tap procedure was less than 2 weeks.  The repeat fundoscopic evaluations were performed approximately 2 months following the spinal tap and the prescription of azetazolamide.

She did describe blurriness of vision about the time frame surrounding the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of spinal tap and azetazolamide.  Such blurriness then subsided after this treatment. 

She did receive a cervical MRI following her MVA demonstrating spinal injury and has had followup with her chiropractor.

The cause of IIH as the name describes is nonspecific.  As such, the history section of this case was enumerated more fully to understand the timeline of development of papilledema.  IIH does not often occur without papilledema, (Digre). Although papilledema usually occurs bilaterally, it is possible to have asymmetric papilledema.  In this case study you can see where one eye is a Frisen stage 3 and the other is closer to stage 4 on the initial evaluations.   Prior to 2004 the diagnosis of IIH required the diagnosis of papilledema via the modified Dandy criteria.   A variant, idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema (IIHWOP) was included in 2004 within the International Headache Society classification criteria.  Such has been documented in the literature since then.  There are two types of IIH; acute and chronic.  Our patient does not fit the acute  category as she did not demostrate acute findings of intracranial bleeding or brain swelling following the MVA.  Chronic IIH is characterized by increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure which can occur without a detectable cause (idiopathic intracranial hypertension) or be triggered by an identifiable cause such as an underlying disease or disorder, injury, drug or cerebral blood clot (secondary intracranial hypertension).  Our patient does fit the second classification of IIH with vision changes occurring 18 months following the MVA.   Chronic mild papilledema can occur for months or years and without significant loss of vision.   However, when such manifests itself action is imperative or there may be permanent damage.  In this case the patient was diagnosed with papilledema 18 months following the MVA and where the MVA may have caused sufficient trauma to set the stage for slow chronic development of IIH.   The neuropsychiatrist made the causally related diagnosis to the MVA of PTSD.   Such a disorder is accompanied by anxiety.  Our patient found that following the MVA she was not able to drive herself to the office and her mother had to drive her due to such anxiety.  Patients with anxiety have an increased incidence of IIH (Kessler).   It is possible then that the PTSD may have served to contribute to the IIH and papilledema conditions.  Late onset papilledema related to spine injury has been reported, (Catz).   However, the latency reported is not nearly as long as in the Catz et al publication and spinal injury in this case is not felt to be principal problem in the development of papilledema.  The concept of latent papilledema does underscore the value of routine repeat opthalmoscopic examinations following spinal injury to detect changes characteristic of IICP.  

She does however, have many other factors outside of the MVA that may be related to the IIH.  She has an extensive medical history, with multiple chronic conditions that contribute to pain and headache, including vision changes. For example, progression of the patient"s rheumatoid arthritis can present with ocular manifestations. Her numerous medications also complicate the clinical picture with their possible side effects, especially the psychiatric medications and corticosteroids. 

The optic disc swelling, papilledema, on fundoscopic exam by the neurologist and subsequently the opthamolgist directed the evaluation toward intracranial hypertension (IH).  IH was confirmed on spinal tap evaluation.  

The CT scans of the brain and orbits were performed initially, since a mass lesion would not only provide a diagnosis but contraindicate other procedures such as a lumbar puncture. The negative findings on CT scan ruled out a CNS mass, and combined with the patient"s lack of recent trauma made a hematoma or hemorrhage from trauma causing increased ICP unlikely. The results from the lumbar puncture then confirmed increased ICP. With no overt CNS lesion and no evidence of infection or flareup of her inflammatory disorders, the diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension) was made.

Pseudotumor cerebri, while labeled idiopathic, has been known to be associated with a number of medications, one of which is corticosteroids. Furthermore, the epidemiology of pseudotumor cerebri shows the incidence favors females to males in a 9:1 ratio. It usually affects patients in the 3rd decade of life, and is correlated with being overweight or obese. Our patient had all these risk factors. The main factor that could be addressed at the time was her obesity, and she was appropriately advised on reducing her weight. Fortunately her papilledema appears to be resolving with lumbar puncture and azetazolamide therapy.

This case is a reminder to the primary care practitioners particulary, as well as specialists on the case, that IH can develop over months or years manifesting as papilledema.  It is critical then to continue to monitor periodically the fundoscopic appearance.  In this case the fundoscopic images came from the office of the opthamolgist.  However, this case has resulted in positive change in the office of the doctor of chiropractic to procure better opthamologic equipment and a means for recording optic disc pictures for documentation and possible comparative evaluation over time.
