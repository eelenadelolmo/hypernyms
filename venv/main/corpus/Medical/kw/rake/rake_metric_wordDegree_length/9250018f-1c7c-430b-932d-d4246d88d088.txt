There is a well cicrumscribed 6.2 X 7.1 X 7.1 cm heterogenous mass which arises from the right ovary and demonstrates some enhancement on the post-gadolinium images. There is no gross invasion of adjacent structures.
Ovarian dysgerminoma
Young female patient (pediatric ir reproductive age group) with a solid ovarian mass that is not hormanally active - the exception ot the rule for most other germ cell neoplasms of gthe ovary.  That is, the dysgerminoma typically does not cause elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (bHCG) levels.  DDX includes other solid neoplasms and  pedunulated fibroid,
A 26 year old woman with a pelvic mass seen on an outside imaging study. The patient is s/p C-section 10 weeks ago.
