Normal vital signs 
Benign abdominal exam
No laboratory studies
The patient was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy;  segmental ileal resection and ileostomy were performed.
• Anteroposterior supine portable radiograph:
• Abnormal lucency in the epigastric region due to anterior free air
• Opaque stripe in right upper quadrant illustrating the falciform ligament (football sign)

Left lateral decubitus portable abdominal radiograph:
Lucency between the right liver edge and lateral right diaphragm
Opaque stripe in area of falciform liagment
Ileal perforation secondary to indomethacin administration
Pneumoperitoneum secondary to:
Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (secondary to necrotizing entercolitis)
Complication of indomethacin treatment
Complication of positive pressure ventilation
Extension from pneumomediastinum
Hirschsprung’s disease
Older children – blunt abdominal trauma; perforated ulcer, Meckel’s diverticulum, or appendix
A male infant was born at an estimated gestational age of 25 weeks.  The patient was intubated and placed on a ventilator due to respiratory distress in the delivery room.  On day of life 3, the patient was found to have a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).  Chest radiographs illustrated increased pulmonary vascular markings consistent with the clinical suspicion of a PDA.  The patient was started on a course of indomethacin to pharmacologically close the PDA.  One day after the last dose of indomethacin (day of life 6), the patient was noted to have bilious residuals from his orogastric feeding tube.  An abdominal exam was benign.  An upper gastrointestinal study was performed showing normal anatomy.  Chest and abdominal radiographs were obtained showing no signs of perforation.  On day of life 7, repeat radiographs were performed showing free air in the peritoneal cavity.
This 25 week old premature infant developed pneumoperitoneum following bowel perforation due to indomethacin administration.  The radiographs illustrate the presence of free air in the abdomen through hepatic edge sign, football (falciform ligament) sign, anterior lying free air bubble.  The most probable differential diagnoses for this patient includes pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (secondary to necrotizing entercolitis) and complication of positive pressure ventilation.  This patient’s radiographs show no signs of air in the bowel wall, making pneumatosis intestinalis less likely, and no evidence of pneumomediastinum.  At surgical evaluation, the bowel demonstrated an ileal perforation.    

Numerous reports have shown an association between indomethacin and intestinal perforation.  Little et al performed a study comparing surgical ligation versus indomethacin treatment in neonates with a PDA.  Seven of the 167 indomethacin patients were found to have a focal intestinal perforation.  Since indomethacin decreases blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract (as well as to the cerebral hemispheres and kidneys), it is believed that perforations are secondary to decreased mucosal blood flow.  Also, as a prostaglandin E2 inhibitor, a side effect is altered mucosal wall secretions and thus, a decrease in the protective barrier.  Although indomethacin therapy has been the first line choice in closing PDAs in neonates, its significant complications may outweigh the benefits of avoiding surgical ligation.
