Calcified mass lesions in the left and right hepatic lobes.  Additional blastic lesions are present in multiple vertebral bodies and in the pelvis.
Metastatic medullary thyroid cancer
Metastatic disease:
1. Mucinous carcinoma of colon, breast, or stomach
2. Ovarian carcinoma
3. Melanoma, osteosarcoma, carcinoid, leiomyosarcoma, thyroid
Benign Tumors:
1. Cavernous hemangioma
2. Congenital cyst
Vascular:
1. Hematoma
2. Calcified hepatic artery aneurysms
Infection:
1. Chronic granulomatous disease of childhood
2. Tuberculosis or histo
3. Old pyogenic or amebic abscesses
39 yo African American male with history of subtotal thyroidectomy in 1995 due to medullary thyroid cancer.
Given both calcified liver masses and blastic bony metastases, DDX becomes more limited to metastatic tumors.
