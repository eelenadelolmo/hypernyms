Hemodialysis
• The frontal view of the chest shows bilateral hazy, nodular opacities and dextrocardia.

• On axial CT, there is a large left pleural effusion and bilateral patchy ground glass opacities in the lung parenchyma, greater on the right than left.
Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema
• Tuberculosis
• Metastatic disease
• Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Edema
61 year old man presents with a cough and shortness of breath; known exposure to tuberculosis.  Past medical history of renal failure and diabetes mellitus
This is an atypical case of pulmonary edema.  The classic "batwing" pattern of perihilar infiltrates is not seen on the chest x-ray. However, on CT there is no evidence of solid nodules, but rather patchy "ground glass opacities" in both lungs.  Therefore, tuberculosis or metastatic disease is unlikely.  In this case, hemodialysis and repeat Chest X-ray proved that the apparent "nodules" were actually patchy areas of air space disease from cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
