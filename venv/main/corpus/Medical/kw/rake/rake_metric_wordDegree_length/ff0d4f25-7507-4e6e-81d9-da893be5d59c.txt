Abdominal distension
Colostomy and reanastamosis
Abdominal radiographs demonstrate multiple dilated bowel loops in the abdomen.  There is no gas in the rectum.
Barium enema shows filling of rectum, sigmoid, descending and transverse colon.
Colonic Atresia
Distal bowel obstruction:
• Ileal atresia
• Meconium ileus
• Colonic atresia
• Immature left colon
• Hischsprungs disease
Neonate on Day 3 of life with abdominal distension, feeding intolerence.
The colon is the least frequent location for intestinal atresia.  Colon atresia usually results from an intrauterine vascular insult to the large bowel.   Multiple atresia syndromes may involve the colon in addition to the small bowel. A proximal location is more common than distal; and, atresia beyond the splenic flexure is unusual.
