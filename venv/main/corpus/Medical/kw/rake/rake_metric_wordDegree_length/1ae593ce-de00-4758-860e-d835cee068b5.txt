Physical exam:  
VSS, afeb, patient in NAD.  AOx4.
The physical exam revealed decreased hearing in the left ear consistent with a sensorineuronal process.  Sensation to light touch and pin prick was also diminished in the V1-V2 distribution of the left side of his face.  The patients exam, to include coordination and gait testing was otherwise completely normal.

Labs:  Thyroid, liver, renal panels as well as Chem 7 and calcium were all normal.  CBC w/ diff was normal.  Audiometry was not performed as hearing was grossly decreased in the left ear.
The mass was resected surgically via retrosigmoid craniectomy.  Pt. is currently being followed.
The MRI reveals an "ice-cream cone" shaped lesion originating from the L. IAC, with extension into the CPA, extending rostrally to compress the left CN V.  It is not invading the brain stem but is compressing it.  On T1, the mass is hypointense with adjacent brain parenchyma and hyperintense on T2 imaging.  There is avid post-gadolinium enhancement on T1 imaging in a slightly heterogenous manner throughout the mass.
Vestibular (Acoustic) Schwannoma
Vestibular (Acoustic) Schwannoma
Meningioma
Patient is a 34 year old man who presented with a 2 year history of increasing hearing loss, tinnitus and occasional vertigo.  In the last few months he has developed L. facial numbness in the V1-V2 distribution.
The patient presented with symptoms classic of a vestibular schwannoma (see factoid).  At 34, though on the young end, he still fit within the epidemiologic classification of most patients presenting between 30-50 years of age.

Interestingly, in addition to his acoustic nerve symptoms, which are present in some degree in 95% of vestibular schwannoma patients, trigeminal nerve symptoms were pronounced and facial nerve symptoms were absent (despite the close proximity of CN VII to CN VIII).  This has been noted in other cases as well.  His vestibular symptoms were transient in nature.

Other CPA masses such as eidermoid includion cysts (IEC's) that don't enhance, Lipomas (T1 doesn't show fat), and Hemangiomas (hyperintense on T1 and T2, often with flow voids present as well) though in the original differential were not in the final differential as the enhancement characteristics of the MRI (as well as morphology) was essentially able to eliminate them from further consideration.  Though the mass looked morphologically like a schwannoma, there still was the possibility, though very slight, that it could be a meningioma as enhancement characteristics can be similar between meningiomas and schwannomas.  

The pathological sample however, confirmed the very strong suspicion that it was a schwannoma.
