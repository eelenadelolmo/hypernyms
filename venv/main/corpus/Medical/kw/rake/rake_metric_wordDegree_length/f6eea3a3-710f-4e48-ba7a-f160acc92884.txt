Clinical Breast Exam:  no evidence of palpable masses
Pt. recieved a mastectomy and lymph node dissection.  Pt. was started on chemotherapy/XRT
A spiculated mass is noted in the 12:00 position of the left breast.  This is found to be irregular, hypoechoic, and densely shadowing on ultrasound.
Bone Scan performed for staging demonstrates diffuse metastatic disease.  The MR of the cervical and thoracic spine demonstrates diffuse metastases.
Osteoblastic metastases to bone,Breast cancer, Stage IV Ductal carcinoma,
57 y.o. female presents for screening mammogram.  Pt. had several monthes of back and upper extremity pain following a "motor vehicle" accident 6 monthes prior.
Pts. persistent back and upper extremity pain were likely due to metastatic breast carcinoma and not due to the MVA.  The metastases to bone were osteolytic in this patient.
