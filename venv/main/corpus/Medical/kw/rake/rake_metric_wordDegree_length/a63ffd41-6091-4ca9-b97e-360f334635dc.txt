Physical exam was significant for increased bowel sounds, irritability on palpation of the right abdomen with a questionable small mass in the RUQ and mild guarding.
Barium enema reduction of this intussusception in this patient was not attempted due to the long duration of symptoms. After 24 hours this is an increased risk of perforation due to bowel necrosis.  The patient was taken to surgery for an emergency laparotomy. A large ileocolic intussusception was found and reduced with viable bowel and no resection was necessary.  No discrete masses were found though several variable sized pericolic lymph nodes were removed. The appendix was removed and the child was doing well post- op.
Upright plain radiograph of the chest and abdomen shows paucity of bowel gas in the right abdomen and no free intraperitoneal air. Contrast enema demonstrates a filling defect in the hepatic flexure of the colon.
Intussusception
Intussusception
Neoplasm, such as lymphoma, much less likely in this age group.
Patient is a 6 1/2 month old male that was brought to the Emergency Room via ambulance for an episode of apnea. He was found by his mother not breathing and unresponsive. She summoned help and a neighbor preformed rescue breathing and spontaneous respiration resumed before the ambulance arrived. The patient vomited several times while in transit. His mother states that he had been congested for approximately two weeks prior to the apneic episode but without cough.
     Past medical history is remarkable only for recent return from travel in the Phillipines and having received no immunizations.
     In the ER he was asymptomatic and was admitted to the ward for observation post life threatening event and to rule out seizure disorder or aspiration. He was place under respiratory isolation until Pertussis and RSV could be ruled out.
     On hospital day #2 he was noted to have decreased abdominal symptoms and to be passing dark guaiac positive stool. He slept poorly that night and was inconsolable. He was noted on hospital day #3 to have a distended abdomen.
