Texto: 
Supernumerary nipple inferior to the right breast at the 5:30 position.
No further evaluation or treatment is necessary
The breast tissue is heterogeneously dense bilaterally, wich could abscure detection of small masses.  A few typically benign calcifications are seen bilaterally.

The craniocaudal view of the right breast demonstrates a small density in the posterior breast.  The anterior edge of the mass is well-defined while the posterior aspect of the mass is not clearly delineated.  The mediolateral oblique view of the right breast demonstrates the mass as a skin lesion in the inframammary fold.  These findings correspond to the supernumerary nipple present on physical examination.
Supernumerary nipple  (Confirmed by physical exam)
Supernumerary nipple
Nevus
Seborrheic Keratosis
Epidermal Inclusion Cyst
40 y.o. female presented for screening mammogram.
A raised skin lesion in the 5:30 o'clock position of the right breast (or 6:30 o'clock position of the left breast) is consistent with a supernumerary nipple located in the "milk line."
