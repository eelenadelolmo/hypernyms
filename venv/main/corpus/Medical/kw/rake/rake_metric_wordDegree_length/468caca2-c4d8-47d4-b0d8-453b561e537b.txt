The NICU was informed of the endotracheal tube placement and it was withdrawn 1.5 cm.  Follow up radiographs showed resolution of the left lung atelectasis.
The lungs are grossly clear on the pre-intubation image. In the post-intubation image, the tip of the endotracheal tube extends into the right mainstem bronchus. This occludes airflow into the left mainstem bronchus resulting in resorption atelectasis of the left lung.
Segmental bronchus intubation
Although there are many potential causes of the demonstrated left lung opacification, visualization of the misplaced endotracheal tube and subsequent repositioning is a requisite first step. In this case, resolution of the atelectasis cleared shortly after and thus the endotracheal tube misplacement with resultant atelectasis was determined to be the cause of the lung opacification.
Two week old girl in the NICU with acute respiratory distress with recent intubation.
The right mainstem bronchus is more nearly aligned with the trachea than the left mainstem bronchus and is most commonly intubated if the endotracheal tube is advanced too far. Post-intubation images are important to verify proper position and to prevent atelectasis of the de-aerated lung lung.
