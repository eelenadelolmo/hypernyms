Texto: 
Hypoxic, tachypneic, fatigued black female with diffuse crackles.  CD4 count of 6.
The patientâ€™s respiratory status continued to worsen during her first 48 hours of admission.  She subsequently required intubation for 5 days.  Her inpatient course was complicated by a moderate right-sided pneumothorax.  Her respiratory symptoms eventually improved and she was discharged to home.
Summary of Image Findings: 
CXR:  

Unremarkable chest radiograph obtained at admission.

Frontal chest radiograph taken 48 hours after admission demonstrating ill-defined ground glass opacities within the bilateral suprahilar regions.  There is also a retrocardiac opacity.  Atypical or viral infectious process.  A CT was recommended.  The admission chest x-ray was unremarkable.  

Frontal chest radiograph taken at 72hrs demonstrates interval placement of endotracheal tube and right-sided central venous catheter.  New right-sided subcutaneous air.  Hypoinflation and mils increased interstitial markings of the lungs.  

Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval development of moderate right-sided pneumothorax

CT:
Chest CT demonstrating diffuse patchy bilateral upper and lower lobe groundglass opacities.  Differential considerations include PCP and CMV pneumonia as well as other opportunistic infection.  This could represent hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
PCP pneumonia (Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia)
Non-Cardiogenic Edema
Cytomegalovirus Pneumonitis
Diffuse Pulmonary Hemorrhage Syndromes
Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis
Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis
31y/o black female who is HIV positive, with slow onset of fatigue, low grade fever and dyspnea over the past several weeks.
Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a potentially life-threatening infection that occurs primarily in immunocompromised individuals. The nomenclature for the species of Pneumocystis that infects humans has been changed from Pneumocystis carinii to Pneumocystis jirovecii.  Typical immunocompromised states include AIDS patients with CD4 counts<200, long term corticosteroid therapy, organ transplants, and chemotherapy patients.  

In immunocompetent patients presenting symptoms develop rapidly (over 4-10 days); and include hypoxia, dry cough, and fever.  A less specific, indolent pattern (over 2-6 weeks) is more common in immunocompromised patients; including fever, malaise, and dyspnea.    

Clinical suspicion should be high in a hypoxic, immunocompromised patient with ground-glass opacities on plain film or high-resolution CT.

CXR: Perihilar or diffuse ground-glass opacities early, which can advance to a consolidative appearance if untreated.  There is a slight upper lobe predominance, which may be associated with prophylaxis with aerosolized pentamidine.  Upper lobe thin-walled cysts can develop in 30% of AIDS patients, which can result in pneumothorax.  

Uncommon plain film findings include multiple pulmonary nodules (some of which may cavitate), a miliary pattern, reticular opacities, and asymmetric consolidation.

Pleural effusions and enlarged lymph nodes are associated rarely.

CT:  Ground glass opacities on HRCT are the predominant finding.  Superimposed smooth intralobular and interlobular septal thickening can also be seen (â€œcrazy-pavingâ€).  Upper lobe cysts can be demonstrated more frequently on CT.  The tree-in-bud pattern is not seen in association with pneumocystis pneumonia.
