Texto: 
Vitals: Oxygen saturation 88% on room air, all other vital signs stable

General: Patient appears to be in mild distress

Respiratory: Patient has markedly decreased breath sounds on the left side with decreased resonance to percussion and decreased tactile fremitus

Remainder of physical exam was unremarkable
Therapeutic thorancentesis, CT recommened but not obtained.
PA and lateral chest x-ray consistent with massive pleural effusion in the left lung. Additional findings include mediastinal shift to the right, right lower lobe mass, right sided deep sulcus sign and possible small pneumothorax in the right lung apex.

53 y/o man presents to the clinic with chest pain and shortness of breath. Patient reports worsening SOB over the past few days. He has a recent history of pancreatic carcinoma treated with distal pancreactomy 3 months prior.
Benign Pleural Effusion

An effusion is abnormal collection of fluid in the pleural space. Normal pleural fluid has a pH of 7.60-7.64, a protein count of less than 2%, < 1000 WBCs per cubic centimeter, and LDH less than 50% of the plasma value. Abnormal fluid collections, that produce symptoms (i.e. shortness of breath, low oxygenation) are usually drained via thoracentesis, a procedure which involves placing a needle in the space between the chest wall and lung pleura. Cytology is then usually performed on the collected fluid and graded by the Light Criteria which states that fluid is exudative if the serum protein ratio greater than 0.5, an LDH ratio greater than 0.6 or if the LDH ratio is more than twice the serum value.
