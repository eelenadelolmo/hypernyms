At initial presentation, he was found to have intact distal pulses and paresthesias of the left foot in the tibial nerve distribution. 

Surgical exploration and irrigation of his wounds occurred within 20 minutes of injury.  Multiple metal and plastic fragments were removed from his leg.  

Five hours after injury he became hypoxic and had increasing oxygen requirements.
The patient was immediately started on systemic anticoagulation with IV Heparin drip and stabilized for transport to Germany on post-injury day 1 where he underwent LLE irrigation and debridement and a four-compartment fasciotomy due to increasing compartment pressures.  Anticoagulation was continued, 4 units of blood were transfused, and bilateral distal pulses remained intact throughout his stay. 

On post-injury day 2 he was transferred and admitted in stable condition stateside — 6,000 miles from point of injury and just 60 hours from time of injury.  Admitting vitals were: temperature of 99.8F, heart rate 101, blood pressure 126/64, respiratory rate 14, and SpO2 95-99 on NC.  He had a GCS of 15 and was able to recall the entire sequence of events surrounding his injury. Physical exam was notable for the same hypoesthesia over lateral plantar and dorsal aspects of left foot (tibial nerve distribution), intact movement of all digits of the left foot, decreased motor strength of LLE, and intact bilateral pulses.  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with slightly decreased breath sounds over right posterior inferior lung field.  Chest X-ray and CT scan again identified the high density (3000 Hounsfield Units) intravascular pulmonary fragment in the same location, right lower lobe pulmonary artery, measuring approx 8x9mm.  Angiography revealed a left popliteal artery aneurysm and left popliteal vein disruption.  Whether the fragment originated from the bullet or a helicopter component was unknown.  

Thoracic Surgery, Vascular Surgery and Interventional Radiology were consulted to decide if observation versus retrieval would be the best course of therapy for his pulmonary artery fragment embolus.  

The interventional radiologists thought the jagged shape of the fragment posed too high a risk to remove immediately, and because the patient had a decreasing oxygen requirement over the next several days and remained relatively asymptomatic, no surgical intervention was attempted.

He was transitioned to warfarin for treatment of both his pulmonary fragment embolus as well as a thrombus in his injured popliteal vein, and he was discharged home in stable condition after 32 days of inpatient care. At 8 months post-injury the soldier was off anticoagulation, performing normal activities and participating in active physical training with his unit.
Initial chest radiograph and frontal view of the left knee taken at 1420 hours on the day of injury in Iraq. Chest radiograph demonstrates no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  A large metallic fragment projects over the popliteal fossa on the knee radiograph.  Follow-up images after dyspnea/hypoxia onset- chest radiograph and frontal view of the knee were taken at 1900 hours on the same day. The previously seen metallic fragment in the region of the popliteal fossa demonstrates interval migration to the rightly lower lobe.  Also noted is mild hypoinflation with associated vascular crowding in the right chest.

Although the long term risks of conservative management are not as well known, removal is not always necessary if the patient is stable and fits criteria for conservative management: relatively minor or resolving symptoms, the ability to anticoagulate the patient, or fixed position of the fragment embolism.  Conservative management includes close observation with symptom management, long-term anticoagulation, and frequent interval follow-up after discharge and after cessation of anticoagulation. 
 
Management choices must be individualized according to the symptoms caused by the fragment, its location in the vascular system, and risks of extraction.  Migration and symptom development warrants investigation and possibly subsequent surgical removal of the fragment.  Pitfalls to avoid are delayed recognition, delayed anticoagulation, fragment dislodgment during intravascular line or vena cava filter placement, and repeat embolization during patient movement or intra-operative manipulation.
