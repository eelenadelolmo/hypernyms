WBC: 14.3
Exam: not available.
After surgical debridement and antibiotics the patient was discharged with no permanent neurologic deficits.
Plain radiograph: usually normal early in the disease course, followed by disk space narrowing and end plate erosions developing late in the disease course.

CT:  normal early with disk space narrowing, cortical bone loss, and paraspinous soft tissue mass seen only after moderately severe changes have occurred.
MR: hyperintense disk on T2 imaging; disk and adjacent bone enhancement; soft tissue mass, epidural abscess, and meningitis.
Discitis/osteomyelitis cervical spine, epidural abscess
Pyogenic spondydiskitis
Granulomatous spondylitis
Intervertebral osteochondrosis
CPPD disease
Axial neuroarthropathy
Occasionally severe degenerative disk disease
46 y.o. woman with a history of diskitis 2 years ago - “successfully” treated.  Now she has increasing neck pain over the past 2 weeks and decreasing range of neck motion.
This case demonstrates how extensive a diskitis/osteomyelitis can evolve with the complication of the epidural abscess tracking superiorly.  Given the minor compression of the cord, the patient was fortunate she not develop cord compressive symptoms, which are a known complication with this disease process.
