Texto: 
Palpable mass in the right abdomen.  Labs, including CEA, HCG, LDH, CA 125, CBC, AFP, urinalysis and comprehensive metabolic panel were within normal limits.
Surgical removal
Large well-circumscribed cystic mass which appears to originate in the pelvis and extend superiorly into the abdomen.  The mass contains areas of fat and calcium.  There are septations noted, but the mass does not enhance.  There is no invasion of the surrounding soft tissues.
Mature Cystic Teratoma
1.  Teratoma (dermoid)
2.  Cystadenoma/cystadenocarinoma
Patient complained of abdominal pain.  Patient's mother noticed a "lump" when pushing on her abdomen.
The mature cystic teratoma was found to originate from the left ovary.  The left ovary and fallopian tube were removed.
