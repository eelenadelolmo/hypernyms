Labs on admission:
WBC 15,800, Diff: 79.4% PMNs, 12.2% Lymphs, 7.8% Monos
Blood culture (from admission): No growth
Patient was treated with surgical intervention.  A ventriculostomy shunt was placed secondary to patients obstructive hydrocephalus from the mass.


Biopsy labs:
CEREBELLUM, BIOPSY: NECROTIC BRAIN TISSUE WITH FIBRINOPURULENT EXUDATE AND BACTERIAL COLONIES, CONSISTENT WITH ABSCESS FORMATION.

Abscess culture: Staphylococcus epidermidis.
Noncontrast CT demonstrates a low attenuating lesion in the left brachipontine region with mass effect on the fourth ventricle.

Sagittal and axial noncontrast T1WI demonstrate a 3 cm area of decreased intensity.  FLAIR axial image demonstrates a central area of decreased intensity with surrounding increased intensity.  Post contrast T1WI demonstrates a ring enhancing lesion with low intensity center.  The diffusion weighted sequence demonstrates increased signal centrally and the ADC map shows decreased signal centrally.

Abscess
59 year old woman with h/o breast cancer two years ago.  Now with nausea, vomiting and vertigo.
The initial diagnosis for a patient with a history of breast cancer and a ring enhancing mass was metastatic disease.  This was based on location and imaging characteristics.  Metastatic disease occassionally can present as increased signal on diffusion weighted imaging but usually presents as low signal.  Abscess and cerebritis presents with DWI increased signal centrally and decreased signal on ADC mapping.
