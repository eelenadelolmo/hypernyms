16 month male: Chest radiographs demonstrates focal air space opacity in the right lower lobe, and right hilar fullness.  Contrast enhanced CT of the chest shows consolidation in the superior segment of the right lower lobe.  Additionally, there is a heterogeneous mass in the right paratracheal region with foci of central hypodensity, and minimal peripheral enhancement, suggestive of necrotic lymphadenopathy.  In the subcarinal region, there is contined area of central hypodenisty that is contiguous with the consolidated lung.

3 year old female: Chest radiographs demonstrate unilateral right sided hilar adenopathy.  Repeat chest radiographs two weeks later demonstrate new right middle lobe opacity.
