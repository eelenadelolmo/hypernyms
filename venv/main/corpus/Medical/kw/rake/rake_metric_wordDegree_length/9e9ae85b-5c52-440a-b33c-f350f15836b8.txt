Multiple transvaginal sonographic images reveal two classic findings for an ovarian teratoma: 
» Dermal plug:  cystic mass with an echogenic mural nodule of hair, fat, sebum.  This is also called the Rokitansky nodule.
 
» “Tip of the iceberg sign”: echogenic interfaces produce ill-defined posterior acoustic shadows
Mature Cystic Teratoma
61 yo Caucasian woman reports that she has had an "ovarian tumor" for the past 27 years, and had been told that it was benign. Report from an outside CT describes an ovarian mass with solid and cystic components containing fat and calcium.
Typically, these lesions are removed to prevent torsion or malignant degeneration.  This patient's uneventful course is a testament to the benignancy of this lesion.
