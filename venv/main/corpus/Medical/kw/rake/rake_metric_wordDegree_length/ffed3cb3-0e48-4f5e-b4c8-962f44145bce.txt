Surgical resection of the mass
Abdomen radiograph reveals small bowel dilatation and air-fluid levels, consistent with obstruction. 

Barium enema shows an obstructing mass at the ascending colon/cecum. 

CT demonstrates a swirling mass containing fat in the region of the ascending colon/cecum.
Intussusception, intraluminal adenocarcinoma, ileocecal junction
67 y.o. man with 9 day history of diarrhea and abdominal pain.
Intraluminal masses may case intussusception as a "leading edge" for peristalsis to propel the proximal segment of bowel - telescoping one loop into another.
