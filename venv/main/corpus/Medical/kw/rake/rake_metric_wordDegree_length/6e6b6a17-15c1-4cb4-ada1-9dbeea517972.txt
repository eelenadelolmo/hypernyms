Normal neuro exam
Surgical excision. Postop followup MRI to assess for complete resection.
Heterogenous intradural extramedullary mass located in the lower thoracic spine.
Epidermoid Inclusion Cyst
Epidermoid, Dermoid,  drop met, meningioma, schwannoma, hemangiopericytoma, AVM
45 y/o male with back pain
This mass was more heterogenous and concerning than the typical epidermoid. 

The most common locations for CNS epidermoids are within the cerebellopontine (CP) angle, parasellar region, and middle cranial fossa. The CP angle is the most common site for epidermoids. Of all CP angle masses, epidermoids are the third most common after vestibular schwannomas and meningiomas. Occurrences within the ventricular system, brain parenchyma, and even the spinal cord, have been reported.
