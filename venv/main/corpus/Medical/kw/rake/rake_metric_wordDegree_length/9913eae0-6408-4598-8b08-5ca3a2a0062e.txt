VS- normal, oropharynx clear,  lung sounds clear bilat, mild tachycardia, benign abdomen, extremities unremarkable.
Conservative with monitoring.
Cspine, ap/lat- linear lucencies throughout the prevertebral soft tissues.

CT, neck and chest-  air collectious throughout the soft tissues of the neck and mediastinum.
Asthma and pneumomediastinum
Pneumonmediastinum secondary to increased pulmonary pressures. (Asthmatic attack)
Spontaneous Pneumomedistinum
Borhaave's Esophagus
Retropharyngeal gas producing infection.
The patient present to the ER with acute anterior neck pain, dysphagia and change in voice.  History was notable for asthma and allergic rhinitis.  No history of pulomary infection in the past.  No prior history of difficult swallowing or change in voice.  Recently had an exacerbation of asthmatic symptoms.
The patient underwent contrast esophagram to evaluate for esophageal disruption with Boorhaves syndrome.  No contrast extravasation was demonstrated on esophagram and the patient was later managed with continued radiographic followup as an inpatient.  She was later dischaged without complication.
