The patient was followed up with serial CT's of the abdomen and pelvis. Being of advanced age and with history of cardiovascular disease, this patient is not a candidate for elective surgery.
There is an abdominal aortic aneurysm, having a bilobed appearance begining suprarenally extending from the level of the SMA inferiorly to the level of the iliac bifurcation, noting an area of relative narrowing in the region of the renal arteries. The largest component is infrarenally with maximal dimensions of 4.9cm AP x 4.4cm TRV. There is intramural thrombus and peripheral rim calcification. No significant extension to involve the iliac arteries themselves.
