Patient is a 19 year old male who has a history of 4 month history of chronic pain in the right side of his low back. His pain became progressively severe and an MRI was obtained which showed an invasive large mass in the right iliac bone with extension into the adjacent soft tissue and right sacroiliac joint. There was bone marrow edema. Initial evaluation showed a small blue round tumor.

Discussion (include references): 
Ewing sarcoma is a neuroectodermal malignant small round blue cell tumor. Although overall rare, Ewing sarcoma is the second most common primary bone malignancy in children. The typically sites in which the cancer cells appear are the femur, the pelvis, the humerus, and the ribs. It most commonly occurs in adolescent males less than 15 years of age. Most cases of Ewing sarcoma are due to the translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 (1). The clinical presentation includes localized pain (worse at night and intensified by exercise) and swelling for weeks or months with erythema and warmth of the local area (2). Trauma may be the initiating incident that brings attention to the lesion. Up to 20% of patients may also have systemic symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, weight loss, or anemia (3). Nearly all patients with this sarcoma are presumed to have a subclinical metastatic disease because 80 to 90 percent of patients relapse after local therapy alone (4). Of all the tumor sites, patients with pelvic tumors have the highest percentage (25%) of concurrent metastatic disease (5). The spine and lungs are the most frequently involved site of metastasis and lung metastases are the leading cause of death in patients with Ewing sarcoma.  This sarcoma may be confused with osteomyelitis due to the increased ESR, fever, leukocytosis, and anemia. It may also be confused with a primary lymphoma of the bone but this can be differentiated as lymphoma of bone occurs in older age groups and is associated with less bone destruction than ES. On imaging, Ewing sarcoma is characterized radiographically with its lamellated appearance or ‚Äúonion skin‚Äù periosteal reaction. The bony lesion is usually lytic, central, and accompanied by endosteal scalloping. The ‚Äúonion-skin‚Äù appearance is often associated with a ‚Äúmoth-eaten‚Äù or mottled appearance to the underlying bone and a soft tissue mass. The treatment includes surgery, radiation, and multi-drug chemotherapy.
