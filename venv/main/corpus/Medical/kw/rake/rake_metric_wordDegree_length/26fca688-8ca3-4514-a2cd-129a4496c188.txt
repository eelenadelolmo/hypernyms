28 weeks gestation
The mass was surgically removed before pregnancy.
• Coronal T2-weighted image single-shot turbo spin-echo image shows that the abnormality actually consists of fluid which displaces the uterus 

• Sagittal T2-weighted image shows a huge  hyperintense mass that is cystic and unilocular with a thin wall
Serous cystadenoma
• Functional cysts,
• paraovarian cysts,
• hydrosalpinx,
• serous cystadenoma
a  32 y.o. woman who presented to the hospital at 28 weeks gestation  for  a huge cystic mass depicted by routine obstetric US.
Serous tumors are common and account for approximately 25% of benign ovarian neoplasms .   Serous cystadenomas are composed of unilocular or multilocular cysts filled with clear watery fluid. The lining of the cyst is flat or may have small papillary projections. The typical MR imaging appearance of serous cystadenoma is a unilocular cyst Because of the potential and unknown effects, MR imaging should be performed only when results of US are inadequate for diagnosis or when MR imaging is expected to provide important information for proper treatment of the fetus or mother .The MR imaging examination should be designed to obtain sufficient information with the least number of imaging sequences.
