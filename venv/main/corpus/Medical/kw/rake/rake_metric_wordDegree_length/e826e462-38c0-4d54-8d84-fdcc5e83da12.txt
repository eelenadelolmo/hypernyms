Texto: 
GEN: pale, listless, altered sensorium, speech lagging; HEENT: pallor, neck stiffness; CV 11/VI flow murmur; Neuro: + meningeal signs, minimal response to stimulation, right sided weakness, reflexes brisk to painful stimuli

Labs: CBC--microcytic hypochromic anemia, neutropenia; low iron level; Anticoagulation panel-- wnl; Lead level--wnl
Patient was hospitalized for about a week for supportive treatment.  She was given IV fluids and PO adlib.  She was transfused with pRBC due to severe anemia.  Patient was placed on multivitamin.  She underwent physical and occupational therapy for rehabilitation due to right sided weakness and speech lagging.

Follow up MRI done 2 months later showed no abnormal signal in the straight or sagittal siuses or any residual ischemic changes in the right or left basal ganglia.
â€¢ CT head without contrast: high attenuation present in internal cerebral veins and straight sinus. Small mass effect seen. 

â€¢ CT with IV contrast: Peripheral enhancement along the structures with central low attenuation. 

â€¢ MRI without contrast: high attenuation suggesting hemorrhage present on midline images in region of the straight sinus.

â€¢ MRI with contrast: Central nonenhancement in straight sinus after IV contrast suggesting venous thrombosis.
Abnormal flair signal in diffusion weighted images in region of thalami bilaterally


Â» Follow up MRI at 2 months: No abnormal signal in region of sagittal sinus or vein of galen. No evidence of residual ischemic change in right or left basal ganglion.
Sagittal sinus thrombosis
â€¢ Stoke
â€¢ Intracranial phlebitis
â€¢ Thrombophlebitis
â€¢ Nonpyogenic thrombosis of intracranial venous system
This 19 month old baby girl presented with 3-day history of decreased activity, several episodes of emesis, and fevers. She has a several month history of pica (dirt and dry wall). PMH: Full term, vaginal birth with no complications. 
FHx: No Fhx of hematologic or coagulopathies
This patient did not have any predisposing factors except that she was dehydrated and severely anemic.
There were no complications during birth and her hypercoagulability work up came up normal.
As stated in the factoid, about 42% of patients with sagittal or cerebral sinus thrombosis wil have focal neurologic signs. This patient did have speech lagging and right-sided weakness. She did recover completely and follow up MRI showed no evidence of residual ischemic changes in the cerebral sinuses.
