70 year old woman presents with dizziness (vertigo)
MRA of revealed absent signal in left vertebral artery due to reversal of flow and not occlusion.  This is a potential pitfall in MR angiography.

Patency of the left vertebral artery was confirmed by CTA; and the proximal occlusion at the origin of the left subclavian artery was demonstrated.
