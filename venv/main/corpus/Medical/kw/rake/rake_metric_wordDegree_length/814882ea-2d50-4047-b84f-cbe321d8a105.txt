Patient had follow-up with pulmonologist and oncologist
Radiograph: CXR images show evidence of abnormal opacification in the right upper lobe.  There is evidence of volume loss with elevation of the right hilum.  No pleural effusions are seen.

CT: consolidation and nodules are noted in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe with a probable central superior right hilar obstructing lesions, which appears to partially invade the right mainstem bronchus.   Also noted is a left adrenal nodule.

58 yo Caucasian male with a 30+ pack-year history of smoking presented with 3 month history of headaches, night sweats, and intentional weight loss.  The patient’s headaches were described as dull, but not debilitating and radiated from the posterior neck and radiated to the top of the head.  The headaches were not relieved by over the counter medications, and did not interfere with sleep and were not associated with nausea and vomiting.  Pt also denied any other neurological symptoms.  The patient stated that he had night sweats that occurred every night that soaked his shirt.  His weight loss was attributed to significant dietary changes and increase in exercise, with no exercise intolerance.  The patient’s medical history was significant for multiple squamous cell carcinomas on the upper extremities and is followed regularly by dermatology.
Inflammatory pseudotumor or myofibroblastic tumor of the lung is a rare, benign lung mass that radiographically can mimic a malignant process.  It has been described as a quasi-neoplastic process and contains inflammatory and myofibroblastic spindle cells.  The cause of this tumor is unknown, but the pseudotumor is characterized as an unregulated inflammatory response.  Although considered benign inflammatory pseudotumors have the potential of local invasion to include the mediastinum, blood vessels, the heart and the spine.  Also, it has been found to have recurrences and metastases.   The incidence of this tumor is 0.04% and comprise between 0.7% and 1.0% of all lung tumors.  However, it is the most common primary lung mass in children, accounting for 50% of benign pediatric intrapulmonary tumors.  It occurs equally between men and women and peaks by the second decade of life.  
In several studies, approximately 50% of patients are asymptomatic and the mass is found on routine chest x-ray, presenting as a solitary calcified mass.  However, others present with cough, fever, dyspnea and hemoptysis.  Histopathologically, inflammatory pseudotumors consist of inflammatory and mesenchymal cells that include plasma cells, histiocytes, lymphocytes and spindle cells.  When compared to lymphoma, pseudotumors consist of both T and B-cells.  There are three histological patterns: organized pneumonia, fibrous histiocytic, and lymphohistiocytic.  However, these patterns do not correlate to radiographic findings.  On chest x-ray, inflammatory pseudotumors present as a solitary, peripheral, well-circumscribed, lobulated mass that has a tendency for the lower lobes of the lung.  On CT scan, they have a varied and non-specific appearance, but usually as heterogeneous attenuation and enhancement.  Calcifications have varied appearances, while cavitation and lymphadenopathy are rare.   Only 5% of cases present as multiple lesions.  
The diagnosis is confirmed by surgical resection with tissue examination or by fine needle biopsy.  Complete surgical resection of the pseudotumor is the treatment of choice, with an excellent prognosis.  Delays in treatment may lead to hilar or mediastinal invasion.  Recurrent lesions should be further resected to prevent invasion into the surrounding tissues.
