Retrograde urethrogram shows the penile and bulbous urethra demarcated by the suspensory ligament of the penis with mild angulation of the urethra at the penoscrotal junction.  Contraction of the deep musculotendinous sling of the bulbocavernous muscle (constrictor nudae muscle) is noted causing circumferential indentation of the proximal bulbous urethra.  Contrast material is noted to enter the bladder.  The verumontanum is seen as an ovoid filling defect in the posterior part of the prostatic urethra.  The distal end of the verumontanum marks the proximal boundary of the membranous urethra that passes through the urogenital diaphragm.  The distal boundary of the membranous urethra is demarcated by the tapering of the bulbous urethra.  The bulbomembranous junction is identified 1.0 cm distal to the inferior margin of the verumonatum.  Voiding cystourethrogram reveals a stricture of the membranous urethra.  Combined voiding cystourethrogram-retrograde urethrogram depicts nonvisualization of the membranous urethra and limited visualization of the prostatic urethra consistent with stricture.
Post-Traumatic Stricture of the Posterior Urethra (Presumably from prior instrumentation)
Traumatic urethral strictures:
Instrumentation 
Indwelling catheters 
Prostatectomy procedures
Chemical injury (podophyllin)
Saddle injuries
Pelvic fractures

Inflammatory strictures:
Gonorrhea
Chlamydia
Myocoplasma
Tuberculosis
Shistosomiasis
52 yo male with known stricture following multiple procedures for BPH.
