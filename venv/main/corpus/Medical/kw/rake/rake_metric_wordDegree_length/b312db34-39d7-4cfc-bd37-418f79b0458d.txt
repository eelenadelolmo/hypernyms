Normal physical examination.
Conservative management may be used for diverticula that are less than one cm in size. If the diverticula contributes to aspiration or pneumonia, surgical repair is advised if the patient can tolerate the procedure.
Frontal, lateral, and oblique images demonstrate a herniation of mucosa and submucosa in the posterior aspect of the pharyngoesophageal junction.
Zenker Diverticulum
These images are characteristic in appearance and location for a Zenker's diverticulum, although similar findings could be found in esophageal perforation or anatomic variant.
44 y/o female with occasional upper abdominal pain and early satiety.
This patient's diverticula measured about 0.6 cm in size and has been relatively asymptomatic to date. Conservative management is appropriate unless this patient becomes symptomatic.
