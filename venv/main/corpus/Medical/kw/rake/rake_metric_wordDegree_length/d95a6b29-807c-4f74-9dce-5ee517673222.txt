Texto: 
Mild subcutaneous right zygomatic bony irregularity without significant tenderness to palpation.
Because of the small chance of malignant degeneration the patient should have follow up CT every 1-2 years or immediately if the patient complains of pain or a change in the size of the deformity.
Expansile right zygomatic bone lesion with central ground glass appearance and small area of cortical disruption. Involvement of temporal bone portion of TMJ joint. No evidence of extra-cortical spread or aggressive periosteal findings.
Fibrous Dysplasia of right temporal and zygomatic bone.
osteosarcoma
fibrosarcoma
bone cyst
Right facial subcutaneous lesion presenting for routine follow up, without specific complaint.
Typical location and appearance with stability on follow-up and no patient complaints make malignant degeneration very unlikely.
