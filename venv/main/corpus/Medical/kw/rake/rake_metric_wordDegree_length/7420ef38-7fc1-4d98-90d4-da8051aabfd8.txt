The patient has had known primary idiopathic achalasia for several years from prior biopsies. The patient has been seen in the GI clinic for multiple balloon dilations.
Dilation of the esophagus with narrowing distally at the gastroesophageal junction.  In achalasia not related to malignancy, the narrowing is typically smooth with a beak-like appearance.  However, if the condition is secondary to a malignancy, then the narrowing may have more aggressive features, such as irregular margins, abrupt shouldering, erosions, or an adjacent soft tissue mass.
Achalasia
A major differential point is that true achalasia tends to occur in younger individuals, whereas secondary achalasia caused by malignancy typically affects an older population (60 years of age and older).  Rarely, secondary achalasia is a paraneoplastic condition produced by tumors remote from the gastroesophageal junction, such as tumors of the breast or lung.  Chagas’ disease is a parasitic infection that is common in South America.  In patients with this disease a protozoan has invaded the gastrointestinal tract, destroying the ganglia of the esophagus, and the result is an achalasia-like motor disorder of the esophagus.
27 year old man with long standing dysphagia.
This case nicely demonstrates the fluoroscopic appearance of achalasia, especially the smooth bird-beak appearance of the distal esophagus and dilation of the upper esophagus.
