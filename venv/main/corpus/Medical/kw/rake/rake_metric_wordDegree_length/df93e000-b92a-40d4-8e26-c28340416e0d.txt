Conservative treatment with physical therapy and passive range of motion exercises is first attempted.  A small percentage of patients will have persistent symptoms in which distention arthrography leading to capsular rupture, manipulation under anesthesia, or arthroscopic capsular release may be attempted.
Coronal T1 fat saturated post gadolinium and axial spoiled gradient recalled echo fat saturated post gadolinium images show ehancement of the joint capsule with significant hypertrophy of the anterior and inferior portions of the middle glenohumeral ligament.

Thoracic outlet syndrome
The patient had a history of a right frozen shoulder in the past.  She now presents with similar symptoms on the left.
This patient has significant joint capsule enhancement consistent with adhesive capsulitis.  Additionally, she has significant hypertrophy of the middle glenohumeral ligament.  This additional finding is not one of the common MR findings reported in the literature for adhesive capsulitis.  Women, as in this case, are more predisposed to this condition.
