Radiographs of the C-spine in flexion, extension, and ondontoid views demonstrate a small fracture lucency in the posterior element of C1 (lateral), 7mm lateral displacement of the C1 mass off the body of C2 (axis), and maintained alantoaxial distance of 2.5 mm with flex/ext. Prevertebral soft tissues are swollen anterior to C1. Axial CT demonstrates burst fracture of C1 with bilateral distraction of vertebral fragments.
