Texto: 
The patient presented with a recent change in proptosis on the right without optic neuropathy.
Defects in the orbital floor and the medial orbital wall on the left are consistent with the patients history of decompression surgery.  The right optic nerve is larger in diameter than the left. The inferior, medial and superior rectus muscles are hypertrophied bilaterally and are symmetrical.  There is relative sparing of the lateral rectus musculature.
Thyroid Ophthalmopathy (Grave's disease)
44 y/o male s/p decompression on the left with a history of graves disease.
