Non-focal neurological exam.
This aneurysm was coiled soon after discovery.  Interval imaging since coiling has confirmed resolution for the past three years.
CT:  There is a berry aneurysm arising from the supraclinoid portion of the left internal carotid artery, measuring 16 mm AP x 13.5 mm CC x12 mm LAT with a 5-mm neck. The aneurysm projects medially and inferiorly from its origin and encroaches on the optic chiasm and pituitary fossa. The pituitary infundibulum may be displaced posteriorly. 

MR:  The ventricles are the upper limits of normal in size. There is a mixed but primarily hypointense signal foci in the parasellar region to the left of midline superimposed over the sella.  On T2WI this has a hypointense signal similar to the signal void of the vesicle.  MR (T1W-Gd) shows enhancement.
 
MRA of the circle of Willis shows a flow void component and a central heterogeneous hyperintense signal component.
Berry Aneurysm
• Congenital berry aneurysm
• Atherosclerotic fusiform aneurysm
• Mycotic aneurysm

Saccular (berry) aneurysms are rounded outpouchings that arise from arterial bifurcation points.  They most commonly arise secondary to abnormal hemodynamic shear stresses, and are not congenital as previously believed.  Berry aneurysms can also be associated with trauma, infection, tumor, drug abuse, AVM, and AVF. 

15-20% of cases are multiple.  They are found in the COW / MCA bifurcation 90% of the time.  Most berry aneurysms become symptomatic between 40 and 60 years of age, commonly presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage, with an associated high mortality and morbidity rate.  The risk of rupture is 1-2% annually.  There is a 20-50% rebleed risk.  Larger size correlates with increased rupture risk, but there is no critical size that can be used to predict risk for bleed.  When a berry aneurysm is discovered, aneurysm obliteration is necessary, because of the poor prognosis for subarachnoid hemorrhage.

CT:  In the case of a patent aneurysm, a well-delineated iso/hyperdense lesion that exhibits uniform intense enhancement is demonstrated.  In the case of a thrombosed aneurysm, the residual lumen and outer rim may enhance strongly.  No enhancement is seen in complete thrombosis.

MR:  Appearance can be highly variable, secondary to varied flow characteristics.  Patent aneurysms can demonstrate a hyper or hypointense signal depending on flow.  Wall enhancement may occur.  Thrombosed aneurysms demonstrate flow void signal surrounded by concentric layers of clot.
