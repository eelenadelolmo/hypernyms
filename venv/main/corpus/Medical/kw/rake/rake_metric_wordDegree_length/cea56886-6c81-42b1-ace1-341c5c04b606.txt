Decreased bowel sounds without abdominal distension or peritoneal signs.  Oral temperature 101 degrees F.  WBC 15,500.
Mild disease can be treated with oral antibiotics (metronidazole and amoxicillin or ciprofloxacin).  More severe disease requires admission and intravenous antibiotics (gentamicin and clindamycin), as well as analgesia.  Risk of subsequent exacerbation can be minimized by consuming a high fiber diet (psyllium, agar, methylcellulose).
Intravenous and enteric contrast-enhanced axial computed tomographic images demonstrate multiple diverticuli predominantly involving the sigmoid colon.  There is an ill-defined area of inflammation ("fat stranding") adjacent to the sigmoid colon in the mid to left hemipelvis without abscess formation.  There is no free air to suggest frank intraperitoneal perforation.
