Partial gastrectomy
Upper GI study reveals markedly distended stomach with poorly opening pyloris and delayed passage of contrast through the pyloric channel into duodenum.

CT images reveal markedly distended, debri filled stomach with focal narrowing of pyloris and decompressed duodenum.
Moderately differntiated adenocarcinoma of stomach (antrum).  Tissue sampling during upper endoscopy.
Malignant tumor: primary gastric adenocarcinoma, metastatic disease
Peptic ulcer disease
Inflammatory disoders: Crohn's, corrosive stricture, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, syphilis, amyloidosis
Congenital disorders: antral mucosal diaphragm, annular pancreas
History of early satiety and weight loss.
