Patient is currently being treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for Strep. pneumoniae on respiratory culture.
PA radiograph demonstrates calcified granulomas and calcified masses within the hila.  A subcarinal mass is demonstrated.

Axial images of the chest with contrast demonstrate bilateral hilar, mediastinal and subcarinal calcified lymphadenopathy.  Calcified granulomas are present within the parenchyma.
Histoplasmosis
Histoplasmosis, Coccidiomycosis, Blastomycosis
Sarcoidosis
Castleman's Disease
32 year old man with 1 week history of cough.
A contrast enhanced CT of the chest was ordered since the initial read on the plain chest radiograph was suspicious for lymphoma. The calcified lymphadenopathy and granulomas was more in line with old granulomatous disease.  The patient had no chronic medical disease and living in an area endemic to histoplasmosis, this was the most likely diagnosis.  Bronchoscopy was performed which was non-diagnostic.

Complications of histoplasmosis include fibrosing mediastinitis and retroperitoneal fibrosis.  Chronic disease may lead to emphysema and bullae formation.
