Readily apparent physical exam findings reveal right foot polydactyly and right lower extremity shortening in a non-ambulatory child.
None at this time.
Pre-axial polydactyly with three medial first rays.
Marked shortening of the right lower extremity with absence of the right tibia and bowing of the fibula.  An ipsilateral hypoplastic acetabulum and right femoral head are also present.  Also noted is a posterior vertebral body fusion anomaly.
Tibial Hemimelia
The most common congenital long bone deficiency is fibular hemimelia, which is congenital absence of the fibula.  In this case, a single right fibula which does not articulate with the femur or talus, is present.
A 2 year old male presents for evaluation with noted foot abnormality and shortened limb.
This patient's presentation of tibial hemimelia in association with pre-axial polydactyly and hypoplasia of the hip is similar to a case reported by Ho which describes a patient with absent tibia, pre-axial polydactyly, cleft palate and micrognathia.  Such cases are in contrast to the more commonly associated finding in tibial hemimelia of absent medial foot rays.  A hypoplastic hip is a more frequently described associated finding.  An incidental finding of a vertebral body posterior fusion anomaly is also seen is this patient.
