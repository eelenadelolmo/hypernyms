Noncontributory
Unknown
Nodular or plaque-like deposits intimately related to the conus and cauda equina.
Drop metastases from previously resected subependymoma.
Given patientâ€™s history, the diagnosis of exclusion is metastatic disease from the patients known primary.  However, one should consider metastatic disease from other malignancies as well.
58 male with a history of a previously resected subependymoma at the level of the foramen of Monroe who was undergoing routine screening.
This case demonstrates the nodular appearance of CSF seeding of malignancies.  Without the post gadolinium images the diagnosis would potentially not be apparent, but with contrast the dramatic enhancement is quite visible.  As there has not been any recent imaging of the patient, his outcome is unknown.
