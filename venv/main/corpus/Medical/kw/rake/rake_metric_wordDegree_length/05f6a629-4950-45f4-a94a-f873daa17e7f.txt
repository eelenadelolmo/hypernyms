The wire sutures from the previous surgery are apparent in the upper abdomen.  Several of these are broken.  There is a tubular tortuous calcification in the left upper quadrant (Film .1Z).  The splenic tip can be identified.  Incidentally seen are extensive costochondral calcifications.  There are also multiple small phleboliths noted in the pelvis.  A lateral view shows a heavily calcified aorta.  The tubular calcification in the left upper quadrant is the splenic artery.  Note how the calcified aorta can be identified as two parallel white lines overlying the L2-3 vertebral bodies on the supine film.  Vascular calcifications are also identified over the right kidney and pelvis.
Calcification of the splenic artery and aorta.
This elderly woman had vague abdominal complaints.  She had a history of upper abdominal surgery ten years earlier.  Identify all calcified structures on the supine (Film .1) and lateral views (Film .2) of the abdomen.
The splenic artery is the third most common major abdominal vessel to calcify, following the aorta and iliac vessels respectively.  The splenic artery may be calcified for only a small portion of its course or, as in this case, for its entirety.  The calcified splenic artery is almost always tortuous.  Where the vessel turns, the calcification has more of a ring-like configuration.  

Splenic artery aneurysms are not uncommon, occurring in up to 10% of patients over the age of 60.  Radiographically these appear as focal rounded calcifications, usually in conjunction with calcification elsewhere within the splenic artery.  Splenic artery aneurysms are usually asymptomatic, but large ones may rupture.  Pregnant women appear particularly susceptible to this complication.  Atherosclerosis is usually the cause of splenic artery aneurysms, but trauma and infection may be etiologies.  Splenomegaly has been described in up to 50% of patients with splenic artery aneurysm.
