Texto: 
Mother's uterine fundal height smaller than expected for the patient's estimated gestational age based on the first day of the last menstrual period.
Surgical correction of the abdominal wall defect.
Multiple prenatal ultrasound images at gestational age of 18 w 5 d demonstrate a four-chambered heart with apex oriented left, a left-sided gastric bubble and loops of bowel herniating through an anterior abdominal wall defect positioned to the right of the umbilical cord insertion.  Postnatal chest and KUB radiographs demonstrate the same.  The final radiograph in this series was obtained after surgical repair of the defect.
Gastroschisis
Gastroschisis (characteristically a right paramedian anterior abdominal wall defect just lateral to and separate from the umbilical cord)
Omphalocele (characteristically a midline anterior abdominal wall defect that involves the umbilical cord with a membrane covering the herniated contents)
Patient's G1P0 19 y.o mother with uneventful pregnancy presented for "routine" obstetrical ultrasound examination.
None.
