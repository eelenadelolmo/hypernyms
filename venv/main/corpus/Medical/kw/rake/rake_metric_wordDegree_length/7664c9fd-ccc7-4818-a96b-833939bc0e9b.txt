Physical exam was normal
Laboratory studies were normal
Echocardiogram-  LVEF 60%, color flow was observed into the pulmonary artery from the aorta but the study was otherwise normal.
The PDA is non-clinical and was not treated.  The syncopal episode was felt to be secondary to dehydration, and not the PDA.
She requires prophalaxis prior to dental work.
A CT angiogram image was submitted demonstrating contrast in a patent ductus arteriosis communicating the aorta to the left main pulmonary artery.
Patent ductus arteriosus
Patent ductus arteriorsus
20 year old female referred to cardiology clinic following a syncople episode while on active duty.  Echocardiogram demonstrated a possible patent ductus arteriosis and a CT angiogram was ordered to confirm.
