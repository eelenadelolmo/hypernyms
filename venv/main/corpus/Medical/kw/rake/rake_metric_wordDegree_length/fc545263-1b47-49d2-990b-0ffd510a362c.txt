Texto: 
Treatment of slipped capital femoral epiphysis involves percutaneous or open pinning of the femoral epiphysis.  There is contoversy wether to pin the contralateral hip as well.  Most recommend prophylactic pinning, especially in high risk patients(black, obese and patients with endocrinopathies).  Prophylactic pinning also minimizes leg length discrepancies.

Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopedics.
AP and frogleg view of the hips demonstrates slippage of the femoral epiphysis from the femoral neck.  This involves between 30 and 60% of the femoral neck width (grade 2).
