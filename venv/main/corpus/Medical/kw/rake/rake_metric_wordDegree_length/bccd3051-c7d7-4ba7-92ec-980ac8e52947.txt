The physical exam was significant for hemotympanum, CSF leakage, Battle's sign, hyperreflexic DTR's, and positive Babinski's. All cranial nerves were intact and there was no evidence of hearing loss.  The pt demonstrated marked agitation, disinhibition (eg. use of profanities, disorientation to time and place, urinary incontinence, dysarthria, and ataxia. The pt did well throughout his hospital course and was eventually discharged to a traumatic brain injury program.
The film included is a head CT without contrast; this film is part of a full head CT series and was chosen because it best demonstrates the basilar skull fracture. There are fractures of both temporal bones seen. The right temporal bone demonstrates a 1.5 cm horizontal fracture that is also a longitudinal fracture of the petrous part of the left temporal bone--this one is not as easily seen;however it is best seen in section #3. The most posterior fracture line is about 6 mm in length. The most anterior fracture line is about 1 cm in length. These two fracture lines can be connected, in which case, it is easily seen that the fracture is interrupted by the mastoid air spaces and that it actually traverses the long axis of the left petrous temporal bone. It is also worth noting the fluid in the mastoid air spaces.
Basilar Skull Fracture--temporal bone involvement
None - imaging shows t-bone fracture
23 year old man, who was involved in a physical altercation. The pt was struck in the back of the head and had his head smashed on a concrete sidewalk. The patient lost consciousness for an unspecified amount of time. He was taken to a local hospital with a GCS of 9.
Thirty-eight percent of basilar skull Fx's involve the petrous part of the temporal bone. Despite the numerous mechanisms of injury, there are three types of Fx's of the temporal bones: longitudinal and transverse or a combination of the tow (mixed). The longitudinal type of Fx is by far the most common in basilar skull Fx's and is seen in this pt's CT scan. Longitudinal Fx's travel along the longaxis of the temporal bone while transverse Fx's cut horizontally through the long axis. It should be noted that longitudinal Fx's can appear horizontal laterally on the skull, as is the case with the pt's right side Fx. Longitudinal Fx's traverse the upper posterior wall of the external auditory canal and the roof of the middle ear. Typical Sx's included hemorrhage, conductive hearing loss, facial paralysis, and hematotympanum. Complications that can arise include free communication between the external ear and the middle ear, possibly resulting in meningitis. Transverse Fx's start in the posterior face of the petrous bone and crosses the roof of the internal auditory canal. Typical transverse Fx Sx's are more severe than longitudinal ones--vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss, hematotympanum, and facial paralysis. There is usually not a communication with the external ear; hence, the incidece of meingitis is low. This pt did not receive and surgical Tx for the fracture, but depending on the situation, sugical Tx may be needed. Longitudinal Fx's are repaired sugrically if there is massive bleeding CSF leakage into the external auditory canal, meningeal exposure, hearing deficits, or irreversible facial nerve paralysis. Transverse Fx's usually have less indications for surgery: Blood/CSF leakage or facial nerve paralysis. In terms of imaging studies, CT is by far the best modality for viewing basilar skull Fx's since CT can determine if the Fx has extended to the external auditory canal or if there are any bony debris in the external auditory canal. However, a closed head injurt might not necessarily be an automatic indication for a head CT. Feuerman, er al. emphasizes the importance of the GCS and complete neurological examination in predicting the possibility of serious complications and the need for head CT. In general, closed head injury pts with a GCS of 15 with a normal mental status and a normal neurological exam can be sent home for observation. Low GCS and/or neurological deficits are indications for head CT.
