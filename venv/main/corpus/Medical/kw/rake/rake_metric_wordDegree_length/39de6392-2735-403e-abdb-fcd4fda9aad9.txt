39-year-old female presents to the reproductive endocrinology clinic for IVF.  A screening mammogram is performed, but not interpreted until after successful IVF is performed.  PT now at 16 weeks pregnancy.
Breast Mass descriptions include location, size, shape, calcifications, margins, and attenuation.  Location is typically divided into quadrants.  Shape descriptors include round, oval, lobulated, irregular, and architectural distortion.  Architectural distortion is a change in the normal breast tissue pattern.  Normal anatomy of the breast involves ducts converging at the nipple.  Distortion is seen as a ‚Äúpulled inward‚Äù appearance of this normal architecture in one focal spot.   Breast cancer is the most common cancer in pregnant women.  Termination of pregnancy has not been shown to improve maternal outcomes, but is an option in patients with advanced cancers requiring chemo or XRT.‚Ä¢Rx  Stage I or II‚Äì Modified radical mastectomy (as opposed to lumpectomy with radiation, which is considered an equivalent rx) to avoid radiation exposure to the fetus.  If Adjuvant Chemo necessary, give after 1st trimester.‚Ä¢Rx Stage III or IV ‚Äì Surgery with chemo after 1st trimester.  ‚Ä¢5 year survival for these patients is 10% and fetal risk is incurred during 1st trimester rx, therefore therapeutic abortion should be considered, although it will not improve outcome.
