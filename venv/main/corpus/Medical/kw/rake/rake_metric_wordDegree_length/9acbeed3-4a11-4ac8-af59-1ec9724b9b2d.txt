Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) is the presence of gas within the wall of the small or large intestine. Radiologic findings for PI on plain radiographs (positive in approximately two-thirds of affected patients) reveal intramural gas that can be linear, curvilinear, or circular in form. In images 1, the PI is seen as tiny radiolucent bubbles projecting obliquely across the left lower abdomen and hemipelvis.  CT is more sensitive than plain films and shows circumpherential collections of air adjacent to lumen of bowel that run parallel with bowel wall, as seen in image 2.  In contrast to air in the lumen, PI lacks the characteristic air-fluid/air-contrast levels seen in intraluminal air.  Also contrast studies of the intestines can be confirmatory, revealing filling defects within the lumen corresponding to the protruding gas cysts.PI can be associated with a wide variety of gastrointestinal (eg. ischemia, infection, intestinal trauma, obstruction, inflammatory bowel disease) and nongastrointestinal causes (COPD).  Assesment of the patient’s clinical status is critical to determine treatment. Urgent surgery is commonly required for patients with PI and clinical evidence of bowel obstruction or ischemia, while asymptomatic patients without metabolic acidosis may be safely observed/medically managed.
