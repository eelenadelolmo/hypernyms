TTP medial gastrocnemius muscle
Treatment is usually conservative (rest, ice, elevation, compression), analgesics/NSAIDS, and 4-8 weeks of decreased activity and potentially with splinting.
MR shows a focal, tubular shaped fluid collection (T1 low and T2 high signal intensity) between the soleus muscle and the medial head of the gastrocnemius.
Plantaris Tendon Tear
MR is diagnostic for plantaris tendon tear.  Differential based on clinical presentation includes gastrocnemius tear, achilles tear, and deep venous thrombosis.
