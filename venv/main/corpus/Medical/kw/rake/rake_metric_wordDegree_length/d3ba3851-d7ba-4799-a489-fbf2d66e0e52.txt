No focal neorologic exam findings.
Surgical resection is planned.
Multiple MRI images, to include FLAIR, T1 pre-gadolinium, T1 post-gadolinium, and T2 FSE pulse sequences show a large partially "cystic" mass in the left parietal lobe which contains a moderately sized solid mural nodule.  The mural nodule shows contrast enhancement.  No significant surrounding edema is present.  There is mass effect on the posterior horn of the left lateral ventricle.

Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma
Superficial Cerebral Astrocytoma
Hemangioblastoma (typically <5cm and posterior fossa)
Astrocytoma
