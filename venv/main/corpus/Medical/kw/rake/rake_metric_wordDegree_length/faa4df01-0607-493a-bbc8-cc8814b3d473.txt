-pleural effusion present in 30% of cases

Normal CXR w/ symptoms
-may represent false negative (volume depletion may initially result in negative CXR)
-Initiation of presumptive antibiotic therapy w/ repeat CXR in 24-48 hrs for initial normal CXR
-CT not reommended for initial evaluation, but may be used for further definition if needed
