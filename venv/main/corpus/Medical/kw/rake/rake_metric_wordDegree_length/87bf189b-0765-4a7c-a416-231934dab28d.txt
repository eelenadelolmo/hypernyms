Right pyramidal tract signs, hypoesthesia of the right upper and lower limb
Unknown
• A large mass lesion with extension from the pons to the cerebellum and the midbrain. The mass expands the pons,the midbrain and the cerebellar peduncles and deforms the forth ventricle. A basilar flow void is present.  
• Axial T1w images show the mass with predominantly low signal intensity.
• Axial T2w and sagittal FLAIR images demonstrate a large pontine mass with  heterogeneous high-signal intensity.
• Axial post contrast T1w images show rim contrast enhancement of the mass with irregular internal margins. 
• DWI shows shows a mixture of facilitated and restricted diffusion.
• Spectroscopic findings (SVS short echo) reveal depression of the NAA (at 2.02 ppm) and creatine (Cr) (at 3.0ppm) peaks, elevation of the lactate (Lac) and/or lipid peak (at 1.33 ppm), and elevation of the choline (Cho) peak (at 3.2 ppm).
