Texto: 
Sacral dimple surrounded by an area of hyperpigmentation found in the midline lumbo-sacral region. Asymmetrical gluteal cleft
Referred to Neurosurgery.
Real-time and static ultrasonagraphy reveals spinal cord to be stretched and extends the length of the canal to S2-S3 in non-dependant position. Nerve roots are non - mobile. Conus medularis is blunted and continuous with a dorsal echogenic mass at S1-S2 level which measures 1.0 cm x 0.6 cm in the sagittal plane. No communicating sinus tract with the skin is identified.
