Physical examination revealed a mass in the right lateral thigh (sub-trochanteric area). Vital signs and complete blood count were normal.
Ultrasound guided fluid aspiration was performed and the patient was discharged home at a stable condition.
MRI study was performed which showed a proteinaceous fluid collection within the superficial soft tissues beginning at the sub-trochanteric level and extending inferiorly. The lesion demonstrated increased signal on T2 sequences and mildly increased signal on T1 sequences. The lesion did not fat suppress nor did it enhance.

Sonographic images taken from the ultrasound guided fluid aspiration procedure revealed a well defined hypoechoic lesion with some internal echoes.

A 26 year old woman who had a history of remote trauma to the right thigh approximately 8 years ago complained of increasing swelling over the lateral aspect of her right thigh.
Morel-Lavalle lesions (MLL) were first described in 1853 by the French physician Maurice Morel-Lavallee. These lesions are usually precipitated by traumatic injury to the thigh causing separation of the skin and subcutaneous tissue from the underlying fascia. Due to the fact that perforating blood vessels and lymphatic channel exist in that interface, they are traumatically disrupted causing a localized hemolymphatic fluid collection within the fascial plane. Organization of the margins then occurs, forming a well localized capsule. The granulation tissue that forms prevents absorption of the fluid pocket which causes the mass to persist for months or even years as in our case. 

Plain film shows a non-specific soft tissue mass. Sonographic features vary according to the age of the lesion. Lesions under one month tend to be more heterogeneous with irregular margins. The specific location may help distinguish it from a post traumatic hematoma. As the lesion ages, the margins became well circumscribed and the fluid collection becomes more homogenous. Re-bleeding might cause a heterogeneous texture in an old lesion. Lesions are often either anechoic or hypoechoic.

CT might show a fluid-fluid level from sedimentation of blood cell products and might also reveal an adjacent healed fracture related to the trauma. MRI helps localize the lesion to the perifascial space also revealing the capsule that prevents auto resolution of this lesion. The signal intensity on T1 when compared to skeletal muscle varies from hyper to hypointense, with hyperintensity reported as being more common in one case series.  All lesions tend to be hypointense when compared to subcutaneous fat on T1 weighted images. STIR and T2 sequences show strong hyperintensity which is often brighter than the subcutaneous fat.  These findings correlate with the serosanguinous nature of this lesion. STIR or T2 fat saturation sequences may reveal fat globules within the lesion. The rim of the lesion is usually hypointense on all sequences. 

With a history of trauma, the typical radiographic features coupled with the classic location of this condition should suggest the diagnosis of this uncommon lesion.
