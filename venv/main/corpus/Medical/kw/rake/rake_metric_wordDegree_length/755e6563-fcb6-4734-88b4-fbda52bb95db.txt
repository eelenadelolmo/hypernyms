Radiographically, the lungs have a characteristic pattern consisting of fine reticular granularity of the parenchyma and air bronchograms that are often more prominent early in the left lower lobe because of superimposition of the cardiac shadow. Occasionally, the initial CXR is normal and develops into the typical pattern by 6-12 hours of life. There can be considerable
ion among films due to phase of respiration and use of CPAP. This case illustrates how medical management with close radiographic follow up can drastically improve the HMD related morbidity and mortality.
Hyaline Membrane Disease
Patient is a 1123 g Caucasian infant male born at 29+0 weeks gestation via low transverse c-section due to maternal pre-eclampsia and abnormal non-reassuring fetal heart tracings. Upon delivery the patient was noted to have respiratory distress with grunting and retractions. He was intubated, given one dose of survanta, and started on a rule-out sepsis protocol with CBC, blood cultures, and started on ampicillin and gentamycin. The patient's chest x-ray showed ground glass opacity consistent with hyaline membrane disease. The patient did not improve with surfactant. He was then placed on a high frequency oscillator ventilator with slight improvement. The patient was then given another dose of surfactant and kept on the oscillator. Over the next several hours the patient's lung opacity markedly improved.
Hyaline membrane disease is a major cause of death in the newborn period. Approximately 50% of all neonatal deaths are due to HMD or its complications. The lungs are poorly compliant due to a deficiency of surfactant which results in progressive atelectasis,
Intra-pulmonary shunting, hypoxemia, and cyanosis. The hyaline membrane that forms and lines the alveoli is composed of protein and sloughed epithelium. This is the result of oxygen exposure, alveolar capillary leakage, and the forces generated by mechanical ventilation.
