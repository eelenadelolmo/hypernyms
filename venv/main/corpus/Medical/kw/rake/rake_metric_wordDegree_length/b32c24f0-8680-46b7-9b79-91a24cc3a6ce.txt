The imaging findings can be variable depending on the location of the disk fragments and its vascularity.  In addition to the fragment one should also note its source with the associated degenerative and/or post traumatic changes.
Disk free fragment
Migrated disk fragment
Perineural cysts
Nerve root tumors: schwannoma or neurofibroma
Herniated disk or nucleus pulposis
Conjoined nerve root
Dilated root sleve
47 year old male with acute on chronic low back pain.  No specific history of trauma.
This case shows a known complication of degenerative changes of the disks.  Given the associated degenerative changes of the L5-S1 disk and the acute presentation of the patientâ€™s symptoms, a disk fragment was high in the differential diagnosis.  Upon surgery, confirmation of the disk fragment was made.
