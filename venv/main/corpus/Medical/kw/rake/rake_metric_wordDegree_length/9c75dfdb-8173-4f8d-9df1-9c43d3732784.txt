Texto: 
Right ankle edema and pain at the lateral malleolus.  limited ROM.
Conservative management and non weight bearing for 6 weeks or as clinically needed.
There is moderate ankle edema, predominantly in the region of the lateral malleolus.  There is a 2 mm offset of the fibula epiphysis from the fibular shaft.
Salter Harris Fracture Type 1
None
Fell from a tree and is unable to bear weight on the right leg.
The offset of the fibular epiphysis with the soft tissue edema are most consistant with a Salter Harris 1 fracture.  Although a Salter Harris 5 lesion cannot be ruled out at this time, if there is evidence of later growth retardation then this can be infered.
