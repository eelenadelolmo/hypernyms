On admission:  Vitals: T 38, P 148, RR 24, BP 109/56
Nasal passages appear boggy and congested, + sinus tenderness. Oropharynx shows post nasal drainage and tonsils appear erythematous and exudative.  Patient unable to flex head toward left shoulder or rotate neck. No peripheral nerve abnormalities noted.
WBC count was 22.2 K with 8 bands and 68 segs.
This patient was initially admitted to the hospital for traction, but the subsequent history was worrisome for a soft tissue neck abscess or phlegmon which was confirmed on contrast enhanced CT.  There was good response to IV antibiotics.
The patient has considerable torticollis with the head held tilted toward the left and flexed. The dens is asymmetrically centered within the C1 ring on the open-mouth odontoid film.  This asymmetry persists on CT with the head in neutral and left rotation.  There is no evidence to suggest a bony fracture, lytic or blastic lesion. Reversal of normal cervical lordosis is present. The odontoid appears intact. The airways are widely patent. 

The prevertebral soft tissues appear prominent but this is difficult to evaluate given the non-standard neck position.
Retropharyngeal Abscess, C1-C2 Fixed rotatory subluxation
Traumatic: C-spine fracture, fixed rotatory subluxation, atlanto-axial dislocation, injury to cervical musculature.  Muscle spasm is usually not a fixed finding. 
Infectious:  Grisel’s syndrome secondary to pharyngitis, otitis media or sinusitis.
Pharmacologic:  Dystonic reaction to antipsychotic and anti- emetics.
8 yr old boy presents to ED with torticollis for ~1 day. Patient had been dancing on his bed on 12/15 and had fallen off. He had no symptoms until the next day (12/16) when he complained of neck pain and sore throat. Mom treated him symptomatically but on 12/17 he developed torticollis.
Four  days prior to falling off the bed, mom had taken the patient to their primary care physician where he was diagnosed with sinusitis. The physician prescribed antibiotics but mom failed to fill the prescription. Patient has history of frequent strep throat infections. 

Mom treated him symptomatically but on 12/17 he developed torticollis. 

He was taken to Children’s Hospital and a cervical spine series was obtained. The findings on plain film were confirmed with non-contrast CT.  He was subsequently placed in traction but became more symptomatic with temperature of 38°C.  A contrast enhanced CT revealed the most likely etiology of the torticollis.
