Physical examination reveals poorly defined tenderness in the forefoot with palpation.
Immobilization for six weeks is usually sufficient for healing.  For a metatarsal stress fracture, a hard-soled shoe is commonly used.  A short-leg cast may be used if excessive movement (preventing healing) occurs.
The radiograph of the forefoot displays some suspicious linear, sclerotic lines but no obvious fractures.  Multiple T2-weighted images clearly demonstrate a transverse defect of the second metatarsal shaft just proximal to the head. Edema (increased signal intensity) is present in the associated marrow and surrounding soft tissue.
Stress fracture
Stress fracture of the second metatarsal.
47 y/o female with 5 month history of foot pain.
Stress fractures comprise about 10% of sports injuries.
95% are in the lower extremities, usually in the tibia or in the metatarsals.  Peak incidence is in the 18-25 year old patient.  A stress fracture begins as microtrauma which, left incompletely healed, leads to gross fracture.  Diagnosis can be based on clinical findings, plain radiography, bone scan, CT, or MRI.
Bone scan can reveal the site of fracture 48-72 hours after symptom onset.  MRI can permit diagnosis without radiation exposure if required or desired.
