PHYSICAL EXAM:	Multiple urticarial appearing erythematous papules in the above distribution. Some of the papules were surmounted by minute pustules.
LABORATORY: Absolute CD4 count - 15 cells/mm3. Leukocyte count - 4,800	cells/mm3 with 54% lymphocytes and 5% eosinophils

 HISTOPATHOLOGY: vertical section shows mild upper dermal edema but is otherwise unremarkable. Transverse sections demonstrate six follicular structures, two of which show involvement with marked spongiosis of the follicular epithelium. The central portion of one follicle is replaced by
eosinophils and there is also a dense perifollicular infiltrate of eosinophils and a few neutrophils.
Flucinonide 0.05 cream bid with moderate improvement.
HIV-ASSOCIATED EOSINOPHILIC FOLLICULITIS (1997 Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, Case#19); submitted by:  Elizabeth Piantanida, MAJ, MC, USA
