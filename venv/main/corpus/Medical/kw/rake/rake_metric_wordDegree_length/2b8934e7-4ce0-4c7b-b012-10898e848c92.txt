As above.
The patient was scheduled to undergo surgical repair of the lesion.
PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate normal cardiomediastinal size and borders as well as clear lungs.

Multiple sagittal oblique MR images of the chest demonstrate a discrete circumferential shelf-like coarctation of the descending aorta 2.7 cm from the origin of the left subclavian artery. Turbulent flow is demonstrated just distal to the stenosis, and there is mild dilation of the ascending aorta. No other cardiac anomalies were present on the examination.  No significant colateralization was appreciated.
Coarctation of the Aorta
Discrete coarctation of the descending aorta
11 year old girl with upper extremity hypertension and absent palpable pulses in the bilateral lower extremities.
