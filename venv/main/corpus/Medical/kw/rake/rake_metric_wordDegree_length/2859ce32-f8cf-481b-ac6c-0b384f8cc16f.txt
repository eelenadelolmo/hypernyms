This is a normal congenital variant, and typically is asymptomatic and does not require treatment.
• PA Chest radiograph: demonstrates a oval opacity superimposed over the the right superior vena cava (SVC).

• CT w/IV contrast: demonstrates a dilated azygous vein and there is no visualization of the intrahepatic segment of the inferior vena cava (IVC).

• This patient also has poly-splenia, which is a known companion abnormality.
Azygous Continuation of the Inferior Vena Cava
Differential of dilated azygous vein also includes: 
• obstructed SVC or IVC
• CHF (congestive heart failure)
• constrictive pericarditis
• overhydration or fluid overload (e.g. resuscitation)
• aneurysmal dilatation.
40 year old woman, previously healthy, presents to the emergency room with chest pain.
