Texto: 
Patient was normotensive, tachycardic, and febrile. The abdomen was without rashes, distention, tenderness, masses, hepatosplenomegaly, guarding or rebound, and bowel sounds were present throughout. The right groin area was tender to mild palpation. The patient had tenderness with passive extension of right thigh (a positive psoas sign) and no tenderness with passive internal rotation of flexed thigh (negative obdurator sign). The physical exam was otherwise unremarkable.
Labs:  CBC: 20>12.1/36.5<350; basic metabolic panel: wnl; urinalysis abnormal for high amount of blood; stool guaiac negative
Following an unsuccessful attempted CT guided percutaneous aspiration of the abscess under local anesthetic, the abscess was surgically incised and drained of approximately 150  milliliters of purulent material containing gram positive cocci (cultures revealed Group A Streptococcus) The patient was then placed on triple antibiotic therapy until the end of her hospital stay
Frontal view of the abdomen shows an abnormal psoas shadow (i.e. blurring of the right psoas muscle edge).
Axial images from CECT (IV and oral) of the abdomen and pelvis at L2 or L3 shows a rim enhanced low-attenuation mass in the right posterior abdomen in close proximity to the cecum laterally, extending medially into the psoas muscle. Additional axial images shows that the mass is fusiform and extends from approximately T12 into the pelvis along the psoas muscle.
Psoas abscess
Abdominal plain film:  retroperitoneal inflammatory process resulting in fluid or pus accumulation, retroperitoneal malignancy (primary or metastatic), hematoma
CT with IV and oral contrast: Abscess (ruptured appendix/diverticulum, Crohn’s disease with fistula formation, chronic pyelonephritis, spreading infection from the spine), Neoplastic (locally invasive colon cancer/ renal cell carcinoma, metastatic cancer, lymphoma)
Patient presented to the ER in Jan2003 with 2 day history of fever, night sweats, groin pain, anorexia, nausea, and fatigue. Approximately 2 weeks prior to presentation the patient was seen by PCP for low-grade fevers and mild groin pain that radiated to her hip and back. She was diagnosed with groin strain and prescribed Flexeril. The patient continued to experience intermittent fevers and progressively worsening pain in her hip and groin despite frequent use of Flexeril. The pain was noted to be particularly bad while climbing stairs that would improve with sitting and rest. There were otherwise no changes in her bowel habits or stool quality (2-3 loose stools/day), no urinary symptoms, chest pain, dispnea, hemoptysis, or musculoskeletal trauma. The patient also denied a history of chronic gastrointestinal disease. She had an appendectomy 10 years ago. Past medical history also significant for a right sided nephrectomy in 2002 for an angiolipoma. Post-operative course complicated by a septic hematoma in the right kidney fossa, pneumonia and deep venous thromboses (DVTs). In 2003 an IVC Greenfield filter was placed for recurrent DVTs unresponsive to anticoagulation therapy.  Medications Flexeril, Aygestin (for Menorrhagia), Progestin and Coumadin.
Psoas abscess is an uncommon and potentially deadly disease usually following a protracted and insidious course. Classically a patient with a psoas abscess presents with a triad of complaints of flank pain, a prolonged fever, and a limitation in hip movement, however, other symptoms include a pain or mass in the thigh,loin or flank, malaise, weight loss, and a flexion contracture of the hip joint. When the cause of the infection is not identifiable the psoas abscess is considered “primary”, otherwise, it is “secondary”. In the US 60% of psoas abscess cases are primary, 88% of which are caused by Staphylococcus aureus. For cases involving a secondary psoas abscess the most significant cause is Crohn’s disease; local infectious processes involving the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, and bones are also significant causes. In this patient the psoas abscess was located on the same side that a heminephrectomy was performed a year prior to presentation suggesting a possible link. There are a few reported cases of psoas abscess formation following nephrectomy.

Because of the insidious nature and variation in clinical presentation of this disease the diagnosis is often delayed. Plainfilm, ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) have proven useful in the diagnosis. On plainfilm a psoas abscess may appear as a mass or blur the ipsilateral psoas muscle edge. Ultrasound (US) is a rapid screening method for identifying a retroperitoneal abscess which appears as an hypoechoic mass. However, US cannot identify the cause of the abscess and requires an experienced technician. CT has the highest sensitivity for diagnosing psoas abscess and remains the method of choice for describing the structure of the lesion and identifying the underlying cause.

Treatment of the abscess typically begins with a CT guided biopsy followed by drainage and antibiotic therapy. If at all possible the abscess should be drained via the less invasive method of radiological guided percutaneous needle aspiration; however, if this fails, open surgical drainage should be performed.
