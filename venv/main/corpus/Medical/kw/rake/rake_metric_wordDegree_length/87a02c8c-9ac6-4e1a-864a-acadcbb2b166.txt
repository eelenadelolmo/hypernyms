Firm, tender palpable mass lateral right knee; Palpable mass lateral distal femur just proximal to the left knee.
The patient was referred to a pediatric orthopedist who will continue to follow these lesions.
Right knee radiograph demonstrates a prominent pedunculated bony projection pointing away from the knee joint, with apparent continuity with cortex and marrow. Questionable cortical irregularity of the inferior stalk is suspicious for a fracture.

Multiple exostoses project from numerous additional sites on bone survey.
