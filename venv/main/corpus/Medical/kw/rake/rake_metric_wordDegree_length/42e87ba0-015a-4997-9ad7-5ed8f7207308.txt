Serum calcium concentrations must be periodically and carefully monitored.  Phosphorus replacement and Vitamin D replacement with Calcitriol are used as the mainstays of treatment.  Amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide are also administered to enhance calcium reabsorption and to reduce the risk of nephrocalcinosis.
Sonographic images through both kidneys demonstrate multiple areas of increased echogenicity involving the medullary pyramids. The remaining renal cortex is normal in echogenicity. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or focal mass lesions.
Medullary Nephrocalcinosis secondary to Hypophosphatemic Rickets
Causes of Medullary Nephrocalcinosis:

Hyperparathyroidism
Hypercalciuria
Hypercalcemia
Medullary sponge kidney
Renal Tubular Acidosis
Milk-Alkali Syndrome
Cushing Syndrome
Bony Metastases
Hyperthyroidism
Hypothyroidism
Sarcoidosis
Furosemide therapy
Vitamin D and Phosphorus therapy in Hypophosphatemic Rickets
This nine year old boy presents with a history of Hypophosphatemic Rickets.
X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets is a congenital metabolic bone disease produced by a urinary phosphate leak.  Vitamin D and oral phosphate supplementation therapy is useful in the treatment of this disease.  Medullary nephrocalcinosis may occur in 33 to 50% of patients with x-linked hypophosphatemic rickets treated with vitamin D and phosphate therapy.  The medullary nephrocalcinosis is due to hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria resulting from the treatment.  The treatment and medullary nephrocalcinosis alone have not been associated with impaired renal function.  However, if secondary hyperparathyroidism develops, increased medullary and cortical echogenicity may be seen with impaired renal function.
