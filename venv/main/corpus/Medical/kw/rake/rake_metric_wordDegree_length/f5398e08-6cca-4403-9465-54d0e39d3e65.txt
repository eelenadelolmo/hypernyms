1. tumor resection
2. There was residual tumor present on post-operative imaging. Decision was made to use adjunct therapy with chemo and radiation vs. additional surgical resection.
Within left parietal region there is a minimally enhancing area of T1 low sgnal measuring 3.4x2.6x3cm. On T2 there is signal prolongation. There is mild gyral expansion and mild local mass effect. 

The mass is non-contrast enhancing on post-gad T1 imaging.
Low grade glial neoplasm
1. Primary Glial Neoplasm
2. Oligodendrocytoma
3. Astrocytoma
4. Infection-abscess
22yo male with 3.5wk history of seizures resulting in right hemiparesis and right sided anesthesia. Patient has left sided headache and right eye diploplia.
