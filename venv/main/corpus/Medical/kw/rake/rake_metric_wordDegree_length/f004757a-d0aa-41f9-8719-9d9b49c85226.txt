Texto: 
Rhonchi throughout lung fields. 
No fevers, chills, chest pain or hemoptysis. 
EKG, CBC and electrolytes normal.
Supportive measures with supplemental oxygen as measured by O2 saturation and hydration with observation. Usually follow-up is not needed and further chest imaging is clear within 24-48 hours.
Central haziness with slight alveolar filling; and, Kerley B lines consistent with pulmonary interstitial lung disease.
Swimming-Induced Pulmonary Edema (SIPE)

    Pneumonia (aspiration and community acquired)
    Allergic/drug reaction
    Near drowning
    ARDS
    Fluid overload
    High-altitude pulmonary edema
26 y.o. athletic man with one week history of cough, congestion, and shortness of breath post open-ocean swim.
SIPE is a well known entity that affects limited members of the community. It typically is found in those that spend time in cold water exercise such as military training with heavy swimming and surface swimming. It tends to occur with prolonged fin use and overhydration prior to the activity. It is theorized that a weakness or failure in the pulmonary capillaries is the cause of the pulmonary edema. 

Overhydration prior to the exercise increases the load on the capillaries and can weaken the blood-gas barrier causing them to leak into the lungs. The cold temperature of the water contributes by vasoconstricting the peripheral vessels and increasing core blood volume. This also increases pulmonary pressures as well as preload and afterload. Stress furthers this effect with vasoconstriction due to sympathetic activity. 

The net effect is increased volume and pressures in the lungs that can leak RBCs and protein-containing edematous fluid into the interstitium. The resulting pulmonary edema can cause dyspnea, tachypnea, cough and reduced oxygen saturation.
