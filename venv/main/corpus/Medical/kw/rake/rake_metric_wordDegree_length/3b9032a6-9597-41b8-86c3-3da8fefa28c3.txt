Closed reduction and casting, closed reduction and percutaneous pin fixation, and open reduction with open ligamentous repair and percutaneous pin fixation.  The surgical treatment of choice is open reduction with ligamentous repair and percutaneous pin fixation if there is a distal radius fracture or a carpal bone fracture.
AP radiograph of the wrist:  There is a transverse fracture through the waist of the scaphoid bone.  Additionally, the lunate bone has a triangular appearance.  The ulnar styloid process is normal.

Lateral radiograph of the wrist:  The capitate bone is dislocated dorsally.  The lunate bone maintains normal articulation with the radius.

Lunate dislocation
The patient fell on an outstretched hand.
Perilunate dislocations are relatively rare.  They occur when the lunate bone maintains normal position with respect to the distal radius while all the other carpal bones are dislocated posteriorly .  This injury is commonly associated with a scaphoid waist fracture as in this case.  An ulnar styloid fracture may occur as well.  On the frontal view of the wrist, the lunate bone appears to have a triangular shape.  On the lateral view, the lunate bone rotates slightly forward.  When evaluating the wrist, Gilulaâ€™s arcs are often described.  The greater arc passes across the scaphoid waist while the lesser arc surrounds the lunate.  Greater arc injuries involve fracture dislocations that include a scaphoid waist fracture as in this case.  Lesser arc injuries cause a spectrum of ligamentous injuries and dislocations that involve the lunate in a pattern of increasing severity.  Stage I injuries cause scapholunate dissociation.  Stage II injuries cause capitolunate instability or a perilunate dislocation as in this case.  Stage III injuries present as a midcarpal dislocation where the lunate is tilted volarly and the other carpal bones are dislocated dorsally with respect to the lunate and radius.  In stage IV injuries, a lunate dislocation occurs.  A lunate dislocation is the most severe of carpal instability.  It is commonly associated with a trans-scaphoid fracture.  This injury produces volar dislocation and forward rotation of the lunate.  The capitate drops into the space vacated by the lunate.  The capitate and all other carpal bones lie posterior to the lunate bone on the lateral radiograph.  The lunate also has a triangular appearance on the frontal radiograph when a lunate dislocation occurs.
