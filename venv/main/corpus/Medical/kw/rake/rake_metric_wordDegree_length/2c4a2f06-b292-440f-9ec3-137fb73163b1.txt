Texto: 
Awake and alert.  GCS = 15.  Small amount of right hand weakness with decreased grip strength (4/5).  PERRLA, EOMI, no nystagmus, bilateral TM clear, no Battle's sign, CN intact, reflexes intact.  Otherwise nonfocal.
The patient received a left temporal craniotomy and the hematoma was evacuated.  The patient was discharged with resolution of symptoms.
• Isodense epidural hematoma
• Compression of the left temporal lobe and horn
• Minimal 3mm midline shift
• Non-displaced skull fracture
Isodense Epidural Hematoma
• Epidural hematoma
• Subdural hematoma
• Epidural empyema
6 year old boy with headache, vomiting, and right hand weakness.  Patient experienced a fall from a porch approximately 10 days prior.
The diagnosis was confirmed and was much more obvious when old films became available from the outside hospital where the patient was initially seen immediately after the fall.  At that time the hematoma was hyperdense and quite obvious.  

This case was somewhat alarming because the patient was being seen 2 weeks after his inital fall.  Because his injury was somewhat subacute, the findings of the epidural hematoma, which was isodense at this point, were not nearly as obvious as at presentation.  The compression of the left temporal horn is an important finding.     

While he was seen at the time of the injury and received noncontrast head CT, those images were not available at the time that this study was being reviewed.  The hematoma was quite hyperdense in the acute phase, as is expected, and diagnosis was much more obvious.  While observation was elected (versus evacuation) at the outside hospital, proper diagnosis was crucial when the patient presented in the subacute stage - because evacuation was then necessary for symptom resolution and positive prognosis.  

An important consideration that this case illustrates is the usefulness of IV contrast for evaluation in the subacute phase of trauma.  This particular institution's policy is to evaluate with noncontrast head CT in the setting of acute trauma and contrast CT if the trauma occurred more that 2 weeks prior.  This case led to a reconsideration of that policy and the use of IV contrast as soon as 1 week following trauma.
