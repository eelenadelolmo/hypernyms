Left sided facial droop with noted drooling.

INR 1.3
The patient was anticoagulated, then continued on long-term warfarin therapy with goal INR of 3.0.
â€¢ There is a low-attenuating mass in the left atrial appendage. This is most suggestive of a thrombus. 
â€¢ The trileaflet aortic valve is calcified and stenotic, with a systolic valve area of 1.4-1.7cm^2.
â€¢ There are no infective vegetations present on either the aortic or mitral valves.
Left atrial appendage thrombus
Infective endocarditis
Left atrial myxoma
Papillary fibroelastoma
Metastatic disease
80 year-old man with a known history of rate-controlled atrial fibrillation and aortic stenosis presented one week prior to study with facial droop.
The initial brain MRI showed scattered lesions consistent with thromboembolic phenomena.

This patient had suspected thromboembolic disease with a cardiac origin. In a patient of this age and with his history of atrial fibrillation and aortic stenosis, left atrial thrombus and infective endocarditis were high on the differential for the embolic source.

The patient underwent two transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) evaluating for possible endocarditis. Both TTEs were negative for atrial thrombus, and neither could effectively image the aortic valve due to the high level of valvular calcification present. It should be noted that TTE has a relatively low sensitivity (high false negative rate) for visualizing left atrial appendage thrombi compared to TEE and cardiac-gated CT.

A transesophageal echocardiogram was bypassed after the patient was deemed not to be a good surgical candidate (based on age and comorbidities); this cardiac-gated CT scan was later performed instead to evaluate for the embolic source. The CT scan showed no evidence of infective endocarditis, but did reveal a filling defect within the left atrial appendage. Of note, single-phase contrast imaging with cardiac-gated CT can have a falsely positive filling defect in the left atrial appendage, especially in cases of atrial fibrillation when the atria may be dilated and/or there is little contractility to allow adequate contrast mixing within the appendage. Key to this study is the late-phase imaging, which showed contrast filling the atrial appendage and highlighting the presence of a thrombus. This finding was pathognomonic. 

Cardiac tumors, including atrial myxomas and papillary fibroelastomas (as well as metastatic disease), are other possibilities, but are considerably more rare; thus, they remain low on the differential diagnosis.
