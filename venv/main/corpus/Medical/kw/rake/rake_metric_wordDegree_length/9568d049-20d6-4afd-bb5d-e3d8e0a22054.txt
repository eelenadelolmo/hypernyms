Radiographs reveal marked cardiomegaly.  Chest CT shows left ventricular hypertrophy with right atrial enlargement.  Tc-99m pyrophosphate scan shows diffuse cardiac uptake of Tc-99m pyrophosphate, including within the right ventricle, and markedly so within the entire left ventricle.
Cardiac amyloidosis
Myocarditis, pericarditis, doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, cardiomyopathy, radiation therapy
