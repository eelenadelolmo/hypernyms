surgical excision
The right kidney is enlarged and hydronephrotic with an obstructing stone at the renal pelvis.
Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis:  renal calculi, secondary hydronephrosis and chronic infection.
High grade obstructive hydronephrosis
43 yo female with recurrent UTI presents with right flank pain, low grade fevers, and vomitting.
Occasionally, this abnormality is mistaken for high-grade obstruction.  The affected kidney in XGP is non-functioning, a finding that can be confirmed on MAG-3 renal scan if there remains a question.  While the process itself does not represent a malignancy, obstruction of the renal pelvis by tumor, such as transitional cell carcinoma, may occasionally be the inciting factor vice the more classic staghorn calculus.
