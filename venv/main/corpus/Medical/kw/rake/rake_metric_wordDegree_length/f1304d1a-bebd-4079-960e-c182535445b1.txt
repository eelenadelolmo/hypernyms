This patient had a wedge resection centrally of this tumor from a posterior approach, but within one year, the tumor grew in size (although pre-operative imaging is not available).
There is an extra-medullary, intradural mass which compresses the cervical cord to the right, posterolaterally. Enhancing avidly, it is both T1 and T2 hypointense.
