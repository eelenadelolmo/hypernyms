Texto: 
Thyroglobulin 18 ng/mL. ( should be undetectable )
Total or near total thyroidectomy followed by I-131 treatment and thyroid hormone suppression with continued monitoring of thyroglobulin levels and I-131 or I-123 scans usually yearly. Adjunctive anatomic imaging with ultrasound, CT, PET or MRI scans as indicated on an individual basis.
FDG PET Scan: Focus of moderately intense radiotracer accumulation in R supraclavicular region. Increased uptake in thymus.
Suspected metastasis of papillary thyroid cancer
Metastatic lesion, reactive LAD, granulomatous disease,  lymphoma, retention of FDG in mediport.
25 yo female patient with papillary thyroid cancer s/p thyroidectomy and I-131 treatment with recent â€œcleanâ€ neck/chest MRI but persistently high thyroglobulin levels on followup.
Papillary thyroid cancer is the most common type of thyroid cancer (70-90% of thyroid malignancies).  Most (>80%) are detectedin stage I or II with survival curves that are similar to normal survival curves.  Treatment usually involves thyroidectomy followed by I-131 ablation.  Then T4 suppression with follow up I-131 scans and/or MRI scans.  Patientâ€™s thyroglobulin levels are also followed with a persistently high level (5-10 ng/mL) suggestive of residual thyroid tissue/metastasis requiring further workup.  PET scan showing a lesion with an SUV of 3.5, as in this case, is highly suggestive of a metastatic lesion, especially in patient with persistently high thyroglobulin levels.
