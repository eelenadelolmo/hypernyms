Nephrectomy
MRI of the brain:
1. PROMINENT PERIVENTRICULAR MICROVASCULAR ISCHEMIC CHANGES AND EXTENSIVE DEEP AND TO A LESSER EXTENT SUBCORTICAL MICROVASCULAR ISCHEMIC WHITE MATTER CHANGES WITH INVOLVEMENT OF THE PONS.
2. NO ACUTE INTRACRANIAL ABNORMALITIES ARE SEEN.

MRI of the lumbar spine:
1) MINIMAL CHRONIC DEPRESSION OF THE SUPERIOR ENDPLATE OF T12 WITH A SCHMORL&#39;S NODE. THERE IS NO EDEMA TO INDICATE RECENT COMPRESSION FRACTURE. 
2) ON THE AXIAL IMAGES, A HETEROGENEOUS LESION IS SEEN IN THE RIGHT RENAL SINUS MEASURING 5 CM. THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE CYST. CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST IS SUGGESTED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION TO EXCLUDE A NEOPLASM. 
3) AT L2-L3: DISC SPACE NARROWING AND MILD DISC BULGE. 
4) AT L3-L4: MILD DISC BULGE AND FACET ARTHROPATHY WITH MODERATE BILATERAL FORAMINAL STENOSIS. 
5) AT L4-L5: MORE ADVANCED FACET ARTHROPATHY WITH GRADE I SPONDYLOLISTHESIS. THERE IS MODERATE BILATERAL FORAMINAL STENOSIS. THERE IS AN ANNULAR TEAR AND A FOCAL LEFT FORAMINAL DISC HERNIATION FURTHER ENCROACHING ON THE LEFT FORAMEN AND IMPINGING THE EXITING LEFT L4 NERVE ROOT. 
6) AT L5-S1: FACET ARTHROPATHY WITH MINIMAL ANTEROLISTHESIS. THERE IS A POSTERIOR ANNULAR TEAR.

CT of abdomen and pelvis:
1) THERE IS A SUSPICIOUS HETEROGENOUSLY ENHANCING SOLID MASS PRESENT AT THE MID TO INFERIOR POLE OF THE RIGHT KIDNEY MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 4.3 X 4.1CM IN DIAMETER. NO OTHER RENAL MASSES ARE IDENTIFIED
2) THERE ARE NO PERIRENAL FLUID COLLECTIONS
3) THERE IS NO EVIDENCE FOR THROMBOSIS WITHIN THE RIGHT RENAL VEIN OR THE INFERIOR VENA CAVA AS VISUALIZED
4) NO SUSPICIOUS ADENOPATHY IS DETECTED

Patient is a 77 year old woman who initially presented to her neurologist with complaints related to her trigeminal neuralgia and low back pain. At the recommendation of her neurologist, she received imaging of her head and lumbar spine. Incidental findings suspicious for a non-cyst renal mass were noted. At this time, urologic consultation was recommended. The patient denied any urinary symptoms at any time during this workup.
Her past medical history was significant for scarlet fever, hypothyroidism, intermittent asthma, and hypertension. Her past surgical history was significant for two partial hysterectomies followed by a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoophorectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and a left partial knee replacement.
Her current medications include synthroid, premarin, valsartan, citalopram, and montelukast.
Her family history showed a maternal grandmother who passed of colon cancer at the age of 35. She denied any alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use.

This is a case in which the evaluation of low back pain, presumably mechanical in nature, reveals a renal cell carcinoma. The patient did not show any of the classic signs of renal cell carcinoma, and flank tenderness to percussion was discovered only after the initial lumbar MRI revealed the renal mass. The patient states that in retrospect, she lost 10lbs over the past year, though this was not entirely unintentional. Additionally, her surgical history of a partial knee replacement and sensory deficits in her lower extremities would suggest general arthritic or degenerative changes. Overall, the clinical picture on presentation is not obvious for renal pathology or cancer.

Initial MRI imaging showed multi-level disk disease as well as the incidental finding of a large renal mass. At this point, costovertebral tenderness was assessed with the Murphyâ€™s punch test and found to be positive. Further imaging studies showed the renal mass to be consistent with renal cell carcinoma with no local invasion or lymph node involvement.

In this case following the MRI evaluation, there was an assumption that the lesion in the kidney was cystic and further followup was not entertained.  Fortunately, contributor/chiropractor (JG), was not satisfied with that assessment and strongly encouraged her patient to seek the help of a specialist.  This case points out clearly that a trusting relationship between the doctor and the patient is necessary and in this case may well have prevented further worsening/complications of this cancer.

Furthermore, it is possible that the patient was not completely asymptomatic from the renal cell carcinoma. Though there are significant degenerative lumbar findings on imaging, the large mass of carcinoma is capable of producing visceral pain, which arises from direct stimulation of afferent nerves due to the stretching, distension, or ischemia that can be caused by the expanding tumor [1]. Pain from renal pathology is classically located in the flank region and radiates to the groin, but other sources of neuropathic pain, such as radiculopathy can follow the same dermatomal course.

Similarly, organ dysfunction in low back pain patients has been demonstrated in the literature. An extreme example is cauda equina compression, which can lead to acute disturbances of bladder and bowel function as well as other neurologic deficits. Pelvic pain and organic dysfunction (PPOD) has been cited as producing chronic symptoms involving the genito-urinary and gastrointestinal system. This disorder often reveals a history of mechanically induced low back pain and has been shown to be effectively treated via chiropractic therapy [2]. Though, the patient in this case did not experience organic dysfunction, it is clear that the presence of significant lumbar and renal pathology can complicate a clinical presentation.
