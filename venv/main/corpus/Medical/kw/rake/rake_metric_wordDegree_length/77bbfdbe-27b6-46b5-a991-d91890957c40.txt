AFP > 1000
After initial diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in 2001, this patient underwent radioablation.  Unfortunately, tumor recurred in 2002.  Further surgery was not offered because of comorbid conditions and metastatic lung disease.  Patient current status is DNR.
There is a very large liver mass with heterogeneous enhacement that extends into hepatic veins, inferior vena cava and into the right atrium.
Hepatocellular carcinoma with extension to the right atrium
Vascular extension of the tumor is almost always a result of hepatocellular carcinoma.  Without this finding a liver mass has its usual differential diagnosis, mets, adenoma, Focal nodular hyperplasia.
Patient presented in this case is an 81 year old woman who was originally diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in 2001.  At that time she underwent radioablation.  At the surveillance appointment in 2002, CT demonstrated a recurrence of tumor.  Due to her comorbid conditions and metastatic lung disease, surgery options were not offered.  In September of 2003, she experienced shortness of breath and chest pain and was seen in the emergency room.  A CT pulmonary angiogram was perfomed to evaluate for a pulmonary embolism.  She ruled out for a pulmonary embolism.  However, selected images from that study are presented here and demonstrate a very large liver tumor with extension into the right atrium
