Continued medical therapy (glucocorticoids, ASA preparations) and interval imaging. Surgery indicated only if obstructive problems develop or if sinus tract fistulizes.
1. Image 1- frontal radiograph from UGI - greater curvature demonstrates abnormal contour
2. Image 2 - magnified view of greater curvature abnormality
3. Image 3 - arrowhead demonstrates tethered outpouching of stomach along greater curvature; arrow demonstrates tiny sinus tract
4. Image 4 - compression spot image of same area taken during the UGI
5. Image 5 - magnified view of greater curvature/distal antrum
6. Image 6- same as 5, with arrows pointing to tiny barium collections surrounded by small collars of edematous mucosa of the proximal antrum consistent with aphthous ulcers
7. Image 7 - axial intravenous and enteric contrasted CT image at level of stomach
8. Image 8- magnified view of 7; arrow demonstrates fibrous band tethering greater curvature of stomach to abdominal wall and contrast protruding outside the confines of the stomach and tracking into the proximal portion of the fibrous strand. This was consistent with a sinus tract.  No extrinsic mass or gastric wall mass was seen.

persistent nausea
The patient had a long history of endoscopically/biopsy proven ileocolic Crohn's disease.  She had more recently developed persistent nausea.  An EGD demonstrated antral aphthous ulcers and a small outpouching of stomach along the greater curvature initially described as a possible gastric diverticulum. UGI was ordered to further clarify that abnormality. The UGI demonstrated the antral aphthous ulcers as well as small duodenal and distal esophageal ulcers (duodenal and esophageal images were not included in this teaching file.) The intraluminal component of the beaked, tethered outpouching of the stomach terminated in small sinus tract. There was tethering and a suggestion of an extinsic compression of the stomach in the region of the sinus tract as well as decreased peristalsis of the antrum and pylorus. CT was obtained to rule out an extrinsic mass. CT demonstrated no mass, but did demonstrate a soft tissue strand of tissue tethering the greater curvature of the stomach to the abdominal wall. The proximal portion of the soft tissue tether demonstrated increased attenuation centrally, consistent with enteric contast within a sinus tract. The findings of aphthous ulcerations, sinus tract, and decreased distal stomach peristalsis, along with the patient's history of ileocolic Crohn's disease, makes the diagnosis of gastroduodenal Crohn's.
