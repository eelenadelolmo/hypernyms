Texto: 
Tender, tense, erythematous right groin.
WBC 12K
Blood cultures positive for Staph Aureus
The patient went to surgery where the hematoma was evacuated and the the femoral artery was patched with a saphenous vein graft.
Multiple views of the pelvis show pseudoaneurysm of the right femoral artery at the level just inferior to the inguinal canal with hematoma tracking superiorly.  There is active extravasation of contrast material at the site of the previous cardiac catheterization.
Femoral Artery Pseudoaneurysm
Pseudoaneurysm
Contained rupture of the femoral artery
58 year old female who resented approximately 3 weeks ago with chest pain.  She had a right femoral artery catheterization which showed no significant blockage.  She represented to the ER approximately 4 days later with worsening right groin pain.  US for DVT was unsuccessful due to patient apin.  Blood cultures were taken.  The patient presented again for worsening pain and a CT of the abdomen/pelvis was obtained.
Pseudoaneurysms can be thrombosed with intrarterial injection of thrombin or treated by inserting a graft at the location of the bleeding.  However, due to the infection at the operative site these were not options.
