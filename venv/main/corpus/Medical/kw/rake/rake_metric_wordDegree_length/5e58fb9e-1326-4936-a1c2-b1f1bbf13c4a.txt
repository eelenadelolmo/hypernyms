Texto: 
The fundamental principle of surgical management of double aortic arch is division of the ring to relieve compression of the trachea and esophagus. In general, this is achieved by dividing the minor arch through an ipsilateral thoracotomy.

â€¢ The patient has a double aortic arch with mild right-arch dominance in size (right arch 8 mm left arch 6 mm diameter). 
â€¢ There is resulting mass-effect on the trachea where the trachea narrows to 3.5 mm. 
â€¢ There is posterior mass-effect on the esophagus with resulting dilation of the more proximal esophagus. The distal esophagus is also dilated and courses slightly to the left of the aorta.

â€¢ The right carotid artery and right subclavian artery originate separately from the right arch while the left carotid artery and left subclavian artery have separate origins from the left arch.

â€¢ The descending aorta travels just to the right of midline and then midline more inferiorly.
