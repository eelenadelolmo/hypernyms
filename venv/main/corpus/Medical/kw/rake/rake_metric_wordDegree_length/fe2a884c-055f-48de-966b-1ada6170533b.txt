Treatment presently consists of surgery (either palliative or gastrectomy); radiation (not normally used due to proximity of other vital organs ); or chemotherapy using a triple regimen of 5-FU, Mitomycin C and Doxorubicin with up to a 30% response in early diagnosed gastric CA.
An abdominal CT with contrast was obtained.  A. Although this is an abdominal CT with contrast, note the sequestration of contrast material in the stomach secondary to complete gastric outlet obstruction. There is a 2 cm mass posterior to the stomach in the vicinity of the antrum. There is a cleavage plane between the mass and the head of the pancreas which suggests a gastric etiology. There is a large infarct in the right lobe of the liver, most likely secondary to right portal vein thrombosis.  B. 2cm gastric mass can be seen. Omental caking is indicative of carcinomatosis is seen anterior to the liver. Significant ascites is noted throughout the abdomen. There are multiple hypodensities in both kidneys which appear consistent with a cystic etiology. Adenopathy is present in the periaortic and parapancreatic regions.  C. More evidence of omental caking, ascites, renal cysts and marked adenopathy.
Adenocarcinoma of Gastric Antrum
54yo caucasian male with 3 month history of progressive early satiety, post prandial vomiting and anorexia. Patient reported weight loss in excess of 15 pounds during previous 1 month. Patient has an 80 pack year history of smoking and 25 year history of heavy alcohol ingestion.
Stomach cancer is the most common internal malignancy worldwide. Adenocarcinoma is the responsible etiology for over 90% of gastric neoplasms. Over half of gastric adenocarcinomas are located in the antrum, the rest are distributed in the body, cardia, and fundus in descending order. Patients typically present with weight loss, anorexia, dyspepsia, early satiety, anemia (iron deficiency), hematemesis. A left supraclavicular (Virchow's node) lymph node may be palpable late in the disease. Lymph node metastases are present in greater than 50% of patients at time of diagnosis. Although the exact etiology remains unknown, risk factors for this disease appear to be: Male sex, Race (Japan has 5-10 times the incidence as the USA believed due to polycyclic hydrocarbon ingestion in smoked fish), Chile also has a much higher incidence, Age (50 plus), Precancerous lesions (such as pernicious anemia (atrophic gastritis type A), adenomatous polyp, chronic H. Pylori gastritis), status post subtotal gastrectomy. Dietary risk factors may be the most significant. Ingestion of increased salt and smoked foods, Vitamin C deficiency, poor carbohydrate intake, and increased nitrate consumption are apparent risk factors for this cancer. There has been a definitive correlation between well water nitrate content and gastric CA
     The prognosis for gastric Ca is remains poor in the long term. Early diagnosis where the cancer is restricted to the gastric mucosa and submucosa has a 85% five year survival. Tumors that have invaded the muscle wall, but not the lymph nodes have a 30% five year survival, and tumors that have extended through the full thickness of the wall and involves lymph nodes has a very poor 5% five year survival rate. Most cancers are diagnosed in late stage which is when symptoms present. Gastric CA is spread by several means, including: 1) direct extension to the liver, greater omentum, pancreas, spleen; 2) Lymphatic: local nodes, regional nodes, distant nodes; 3) Hematogenous: hepatic, pulmonary, bone, CNS.
     In the case of this patient who presented very late in his illness he died less than 5 weeks after his initial presentation. This patient demonstrated a classic presentation for this illness- post prandial vomiting (approx 30 mins after meal), significant weight loss, liquid diet for 2 months (unable to pass solids thru antrum) which ultimately progressed to an inability to tolerate liquids for 2 weeks prior to admission.
