solid mass in left breast
Patient sent to breast care clinic.
Ultrasound demonstrates a hypoechoic well circumscribed mass.
Fibroadenoma
19-year-old female with palpable mass in left breast.
Fibroadenoma is the most common benign solid lesion.  It is caused by overgrowth of stromal connective tissue.  It is typically seen in younger women but may be seen in older patients on hormone replacement therapy.  Physical exam will demonstrate freely moveable masses which may or may not be painful.  There may be multiple lesions in up to 16 % of cases.   The appearance on mammography is a well-circumscribed oval, round or lobulated mass.  If undergoing degeneration they will develop coarse calcifications classically referred to as popcorn calcifications.  Ultrasound is typically the first line of imaging in younger patients and will demonstrate a hypoechoic well circumscribed mass with no posterior acoustic shadowing.  Unfortunately, nonsurgical imaging is limited in differentiating fibroadenomas from cancer and a biopsy or surgical excision will typically be required.
