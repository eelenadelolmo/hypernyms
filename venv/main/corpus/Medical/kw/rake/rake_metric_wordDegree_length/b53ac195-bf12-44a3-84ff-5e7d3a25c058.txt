Left foot in large, limb preservation bandage.  Distal pulses not palpated. Left popliteal artery palpable.
Atherectomy.  

Patient underwent transmetatarsal amputation with good healing at 2 weeks after surgery.
Initially, focal area of greater than 50% stenosis of SFA with no inline runoff to the foot.  Post atherectomy of the SFA, tibioperoneal trunk, and posterior tibial artery demonstrates marked improvement of the stenoses as well as the runoff to the ankle.
Peripheral vascular disease s/p atherectomy
Atherosclerosis
82 year old diabetic male with nonhealing ulcer on left foot.  Patient to undergo transmetatarsal amputation.  Requesting atherectomy of the left lower extremity to improve blood flow to foot to improve healing.
Although atherectomy is still making a come-back for lower extremity arteries, particularly the tibial arteries, it showed a dramatic result in this patient. He had marked improvement in blood flow to his left foot, underwent transmetatarsal amputation with a good result at discharge from the hospital. Although further clinical trials are needed to show evidence for atherectomy success, it proved to be beneficial in this patient.
