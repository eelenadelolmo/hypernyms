Treatment can include calcitonin, diphosphonate and mithramycin.
Need to follow-up and be aware of possibility of pathologic fractures and a chance(<1%)of malignant degeneration.
Skeletal survey performed to rule-out multiple myeloma demonstrated incidental finding in the right distal femur.  A lucency is seen in the distal femur starting in the femoral condyles with an advancing edge of lucency to the mid diaphysis.  This lytic lesion demonstrating a "blade-of-grass" or "candle-flame" appearance.  There is also trabecular and cortical thickening in the femoral condyles.
Paget's Disease of Bone
Classic appearance of the lytic phase of Paget's, really no differential in the case.
65 y/o asymptomatic woman who obtained a skeletal survey for work-up of suspected multiple myeloma.
This case demonstrates the classic appearance of the lytic phase of Paget's.  Begining in the subarticular location at the end of a long bone and advances with a sharp border in a "blade-of-grass" configuration.  It also underscores some of the classic presenting aspects.  Older patient population (65 y/o), incidental finding on radiograph (asymptomatic patient) and in a relatively common location (femur).
