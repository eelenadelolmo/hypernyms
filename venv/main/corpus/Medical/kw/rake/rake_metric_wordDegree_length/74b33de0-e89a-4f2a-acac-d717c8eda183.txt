During her hospitalization she developed acute respiratory failure and died 36 days after admission.  Her autopsy showed a "mummified" appearance to the Right basal ganglia infarct, with "mineralization and scattered hemosiderin".  There were "focal microhemorrhages" and "calcification-mineralization of the infarcted tissue. Mineralized neurons are seen."
Â» CT (acute)
â€¢ abnormal hyper-attenuation in the right basal ganglia
   (putamen and caudate head)
â€¢ old left basal ganglia lacunar infarct
â€¢ bilateral cerebellar wedge lesions

Â» MRI (subacute - 3 days)
â€¢ T1W hyperintensity in the same region as hyper-attenuation on CT
   (putamen and caudate head)
â€¢ T2W hypointensity in basal ganglia - putamen and caudate head
Nonketotic Hyperglycemic Hemichorea/Hemiballismus
â€¢ Cerebral infarction
â€¢ Reperfusion contrast enhancement
â€¢ Hemorrhagic stroke
â€¢ Hypertensive hemorrhage
â€¢ Angioinvasive mycotic hemorrhage
This previously healthy 50 y.o. woman presents with the acute onset of left sided hemichorea.
Hyperglycemia is associated with damage to the basal ganglia (BG).  Proposed mechanisms include selective vulnerability, altered BG metabolism, breakdown of the blood brain barrier, hyper-viscosity of blood, and underlying small vessel disease.

The appearance of a hyperdense infarction on CT is often related to re-perfusion.  This may be seen following thrombolysis, especially after a contrast injection.  In this patient, without a contrast injection, there must be another explanation for the high attenuation.  On the non-contrast CT, the hyper attenuation could be due to microscopic extravasated RBCs - but it is not confluent like a hematoma.  

The subacute (3 days) MRI findings might also be explained by intact  RBCs, extravasated - with intracellular met-hemoglobin.  Intracellular methemoglobin is bright on T1W and dark on T2W - just as shown in this case.  Lysed RBCs, with extracellular methemoglobin, is bright on both T1 and T2.

There are, however, other explanations for T1W bright/T2 dark putamen in non-ketotic hyperglycemic hemichorea/hemiballismus - including reactive astrogliosis with manganese accumulation.  You may read the linked topics for more discussion.
