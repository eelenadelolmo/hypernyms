CT myelogram demonstrates a fluid filled structure within the lateral aspect of the spinal canal in the region of the right C7 nerve root origin, consistent with a post-traumatic pseudomeningocele.

MR images also demonstrate findings consistent with a pseudomeningocele in the region of the right C7 nerve root origin.  However, no definite nerve root is appreciated within the fluid collection.  Also noted was increased T2 signal within the rotator cuff muscles, consistent with strain injury (not shown).
