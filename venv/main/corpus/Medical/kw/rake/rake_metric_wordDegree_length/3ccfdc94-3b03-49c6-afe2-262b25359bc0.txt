Palpable tubular masses in the left hemiscrotum ("bag of worms").
Dilatation of the pampiniform plexus with multiple vessels measuring greater than 0.3 cm with Valsalva maneuver.  One vessel is measured at 0.5 cm without Valsalva maneuver.  These vessels demonstrate regurtitant flow during valsalva
Varicocele
Varicocele
42 active duty male with diffuse scrotal pain, progressive over the past 7 months.
This is an isolated left varicocele, the most common side for venous dilatation secondary to the long course of the left gonadal vein to the left renal vein.  If this had been an isolated varicocele on the right, further evaluation to exclude pelvic or retroperitoneal masses should be initiated as the right gonadal vein is shorter and empties directly into the distal inferior vena cava.
