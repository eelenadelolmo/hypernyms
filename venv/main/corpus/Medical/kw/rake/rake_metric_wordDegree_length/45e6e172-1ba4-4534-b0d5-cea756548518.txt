â€¢ radiating pain with active ROM of cervical spine in flexion, extension, rotation, and lateral bending
â€¢ (+) Spurlingâ€™s Test (cervical compression test)
â€¢ decreased strength of biceps, triceps, and wrist extension on left (4/5).
â€¢ Grip strength on right 55 lbs, on left 20 lbs
â€¢ hypomobility of the cervical spine region with increased muscular tonicity 
â€¢ point tenderness of mid-cervical vertebrae
â€¢ abnormal EMG with Left C5 radiculopathy
In his 4 month followup appointment after ACDF surgery the patient was found to have moderate to severe cervical radiculpathy secondary to pseudoarthrosis.  He is currently being treated with a bone fusion stimulator and cervical spinal manipulation therapy.
â€¢ Pre-surgery: Cervical MRI
Â» REVERSAL OF CERVICAL CURVATURE.  
Â» MULTILEVEL SPONDYLOSIS, DISC SPACE NARROWING, BILATERAL FORAMINAL STENOSIS
Â» Central disc herniation in C3-4, C5-6, and C6-7.

â€¢ Cervical X-RAY:
Â» Neural foramina are narrowed.  
Â» Advanced anterior/posterior marginal osteophytes.  
Â» Disc heights are collapsed at C4-5 and C5-6.  
Â» Reversal of normal cervical lordosis.

â€¢ Post-surgery: Cervical X-RAY
Â» C3-C7 ACDF with hardware in good position and no evidence of loosening
Â» C3-4 complete nonunion
Â» Lucencies suspicious for partial delayed union at several levels where ACDF was performed
Pseudoarthrosis after Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF)
â€¢ Thoracic outlet syndrome
â€¢ Brachial Plexus Injury
â€¢ Cervical Disc Injury
â€¢ Cervical Spine Strain/Sprain
â€¢ Rotator Cuff Injury
This 49 year old man presents to chiropractor office for cervical radiculopathy exacerbated after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF).  The pain is sharp and typically originates from the cervical region and radiates down the shoulders, arms, and back.  MVC 12 months ago.
CASE CONTRIBUTORS: Chan, Wendy,  Gerow DC, Geoffrey,  Garvey DC, Joanna, Serghany MD, Joseph,  Kartha MD, Krishnan,  Loftus MD, Randall,  Aktar MD, Amina,  Feld MD, Gregory.  

The patient had several risk factors for developing cervical nonunion following his ACDF surgery including: younger age, multiple fusion levels, allografts, and 30 pack year history of smoking tobacco.  

Detailed Hx: MVC 12 months ago with resulting multilevel spondylosis, disc herniation, disc space narrowing, and reversal of cervical curvature.  Six months of conservative therapy, including PT and chiropractic treatments, failed to improve cervical radiculopathy and so the patient and his medical team agreed ACDF surgery was indicated.  Patient has noticed improvement in his balance and gait post-surgery, however the intensity of the neck pain has since worsened and often triggers migraine headaches.
