This knot grew to the size of a small grapefruit in a month.  Athough the author of the case does non mention it, it would be surprising if this patient was not experiencing some degree of radiculopathy from nerve root compression.
Because patients with non skeletal ES can present with disease close to bone, tumors can result in neuropathic pain. A comprehensive neurological examination to evaluate asymmetric weakness, numbness, or pain should be performed. A CT of the lungs should be performed to evaluate for metastatic disease. Radioisotope bone scanning would be helpful for identifying any bony metastesis.

Treatment is surgery, if essential structures can be spared, radiotion theraphy and chemotherapy
There is a mass in the rigth posterior neck wich desplaces the muscles. Axial Fat Sat T2 demonstrates a large cystic component to this mass.  Gadolinium enchanced fat sat axial and coronal T1 images show that the mass heterogeniously enchances and that a component of the mass is within a neural foramin which has been deformed and expanded.  There is no macroscopic invasion by the tumor of the bones of the spine.
Extraskeletal Ewing's sarcoma
CT guided fine needle aspiration confirmed the diagnosis.
In no particular order:
Nonrhabdomyosarcoma SoftTissue Sarcomas (see http://www.emedicine.com/PED/topic2764.htmfor an excellent discussion of this tumor subset)
Non Hodkin's Lymphoma
Ewing's sarcoma 
Desmoid tumor


lymphangiosarcoma
and a host of other soft tissue tumors



Liposarcoma, well differentiated Ring chromosome 12 80% 

Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma t(2;13)(q35;q14) 80% 

Synovial sarcoma
The patient is a teenager who was in state of good health. 6 month previous to the diagnosis he was noted to have a "quarter sized" knot at the back of his right neck.
This tumor, because it is adjacent to critical neurologic structures requires consideration of emergent radiation therapy, surgery, and steroids to attempt to prevent nerve damage.
