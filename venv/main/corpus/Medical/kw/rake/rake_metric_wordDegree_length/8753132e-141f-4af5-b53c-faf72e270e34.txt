Right-sided paralysis. AAO x 3. No labs.
This patient was being seen by the neurology service and receiving intravenous corticosteroids. ).
â€¢ The characteristics Dawson's fingers are the classic periventricular white matter lesions situated perpendicular to the ventricles as seen in this patient's images.

â€¢ On T2-flair weighted images, the plaques are hyperintense compared to brain.

â€¢ The perivascular demyelination gives the appearance of a finger pointing along the axis of the vessel. In the pathologic literature these elongated lesions have been named "Dawson's fingers." Active demyelination is accompanied by transient breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. There are chronic lesions that demonstrate gliosis.
