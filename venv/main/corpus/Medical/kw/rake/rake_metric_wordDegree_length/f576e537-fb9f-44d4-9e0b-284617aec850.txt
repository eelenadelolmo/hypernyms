Eye Examination:
 - VA: NLP OD, 20/20 OS
 - IOP: 19 mm OD, 19 mm OS
 - Ptosis and inflammation RUL
 - Severe proptosis
 - Chemosis and injection OD
 - Hard nodule over RLG and RUL

Ocular Examination:
 - Palpebral fissures: 10 mm OD, 8 mm OS
 - Hertel Ex: 28 mm OD, 10 mm OS
 - Pupillary Ex: 3-4 mm pup defect OD
 - Fundus: complete ON atrophy

General Examination:
 - Normal Neurologic examination
 - Normal Chest x-ray
 - No lymphadenopathy
 - No skin melanoma
Management:
 - Anterior orbitotomy: Multinodular, bluish pigmentation, bony erosion
 - Orbital exenteration; partial removal of frontal and temporal bones; craniotomy.

Folow up:
 - Patient died of acute myocardial infarction, one month after second surgery.
 - Autopsy: Metastatic melanoma, lower lobe, right lung.
Head MRI:
 - “ The lacrimal lesion demonstrates a heterogenous pattern of enhancement and is low signal on T1.
 - The posterior orbital lesion has more homogenous pattern of enhancement with low T1 signal.
 - The intracranial portion demonstrates hi T1 signal which is not fat and enhances mildly.
 - This could represent calcification, blood products, melanin, or mucinous material”
