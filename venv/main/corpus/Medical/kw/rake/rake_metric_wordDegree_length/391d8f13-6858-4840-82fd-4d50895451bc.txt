UTI
1.	Longitudinal ultrasound view of the bladder demonstrates an oval tubular extension from the anterior portion of the bladder.
2.	 Lateral view of the bladder and urethra from a VCUG demonstrates and anterior contrast filled diverticulum extending from and continuous with the bladder
3.	Anterior view of the bladder from a VCUG demonstrates a contrast filled diverticulum extending from the bladder
Vesicourachal diverticulum
None
3 week old with UTI, R/o posterior urethral valves
-Factoid Discussion:  Embryologically there is a communication between the bladder and the umbilicus which typically closes before birth.  If the lumen of the urachus does not completely close a sinus or diverticulum may remain.  These findings may be demonstrated on US or VCUG.  A patent urachus is frequently seen with posterior urethral valves and prune-belly syndrome or abdominal wall defects (omphalocele).   A urachal sinus is persistence of the ventral part of the urachus at the abdominal wall end.  A urachal diverticulum is persistence of the urachus at the bladder end.  A urachal cyst is encapsulation of fluid within the urachus and is closed at both the abdominal wall and bladder ends.
