Phyisical exam was noncontributory.  Laboratory values were unremarkable.
Surgical resection.
A 3.7 cm well-circumscribed lesion soft tissue opacity is noted in the left lower lobe.  On CT images it has areas of lace-like calcifications, but predominately soft-tissue in attenuation.  The adjacent lung parenchyma is normal in appearance, suggestive of a non-aggressive lesion.
