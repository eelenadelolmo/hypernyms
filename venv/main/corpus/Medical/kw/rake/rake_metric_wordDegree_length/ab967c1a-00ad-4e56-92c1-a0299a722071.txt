Afebrile.  The skin overlying the left knee is intact without erythema, ecchymosis or abnormal warmth.  No medial or lateral joint line tenderness.  No joint effusion.  No laxity to varus and valgus stress.  Negative McMurray's and Appley's grind tests.
In a skeletally mature patient with persistent pain, or with an enlarging osteochondroma, malignant transformation must be ruled out.  In this case, there was no evidence of malignant degeneration on a gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging study of this patient's left knee.
AP and lateral plain radiographs of the left knee demonstrate a 2.5 cm long cortically-based osseous protuberance eminating from the medial aspect of the distal femur and pointing away from the adjacent knee joint.  Both plain radiographs and magnetic resonance images demonstrate this lesion is continous with both the medullary canal and cortex of the femur.  A cartilaginous cap is seen on MRI without evidence of abnormal enhancement, nor soft tissue mass, nor invasion.
