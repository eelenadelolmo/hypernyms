Physical exam unremarkable.  Patient appears stated age. 

LAB - 
PSA - 31.1
Fortunately for this patient no definite bone metastases were found.
Initial anterior whole body planar bone scan demonstrates two foci of radiotracer accumulation bilaterally adjacent to the bladder which additionally seem to project over the pelvic bones.

Correlation with previous CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis reveal these to be two large bladder diverticula.  The larger of the two is shown here just to the left of the bladder.
Bladder Diverticula
Metastatic prostate carcinoma within the pelvis (on seeing initial bone scan)
Bladder diverticula
75 y.o. man with a known history of prostate cancer, now with rising PSA.  Needs bone scan to look for metastatic disease.
Though CT helped put this case to rest, another image which could have helped clarify the source of abnormal radiotracer uptake in this patient would have been the caudal pelvic view.  This is another delayed imaging technique which essentially produces an axial plane image of the pelvis as a CT would.  The bladder diverticula could have possibly been seen projecting outside the bone.  Follow up anatomic imaging would still have been necessary to further clarify the soft tissue abnormality; however, the caudal view would help decipher bony pelvic involvement.

Finally, this case helps to outline the importance of correlative anatomical imaging to assist in reading nuclear medicine studies, which are functional images.
