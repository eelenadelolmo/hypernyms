Physical exam is normal except for mild tenderness to palpation over the left posterior ribs.
Current treatment for multiple myeloma is initial combination chemotherapy and other medication such as steroids or thalidomide for cytoreduction followed by bone marrow transplantation (3). Recent studies have shown the bisphosphonates decrease the incidence of pathologic fractures. Patients are followed with skeletal surveys to evaluate for response to therapy and disease progression.  Bone scans are usually negative with multiple myeloma. CT and MRI can be used to define the lesions more accurately. The new technique of total body MRI may become useful for evaluating the extent of disease on one study(4).
1.  A-P radiograph of the lower ribs shows an expansile lytic lesion of the left tenth rib.

2. A-P radiograph of the pelvis shows lytic lesions of both acetabular regions.

3.  Lateral radiograph of the skull shows lytic lesions  in the temporoparietal region.
