Arteriovenous malformations can be treated with embolotherapy.  Embolotherapy is usually restricted to malformations with feeding vessels 3 mm or greater in diameter.  Pulmonary angiography should be performed prior to treatment in order to determine the number of  feeding vessels to the arteriovenous malformation.  Surgery is reserved for very large lesions.
PA and Lateral Chest Radiographs show multiple nodular opacities with a lobular appearance in the right lung base and right upper lung.  The right heart boarder is partially obscured and silhouetted out which is consistent cystic changes and bronchiectasis seen on CT examination.  The patient also has mild biapical pleural thickening.

Computed Tomography examination:  An axial image through the lower lobes shows an enlarged feeding artery in the right lower lobe that branches into three smaller arteries each measuring less than 3 mm in diameter.  The smaller feeding arteries coalesce at the vascular malformation where a single draining vein arises.  The distal end of the draining vein is not shown; however, it flows into the right lower lobe pulmonary vein.  An axial image more superiorly in the right upper lobe shows a second vascular malformation that is fed by a single branch of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery. Several small draining veins arise from the vascular malformation and empty into the right upper lobe pulmonary vein.
Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformation
1.  Neoplastic Process
    
    Primary: Bronchogenic carcinoma,      
             Lymphoma,Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma
             Hamartoma, Connective Tissue and Neural  
             Tumors, Laryngeal papillomatosis
    
    Secondary: Metastatic Carcinoma or Sarcoma

2.  Inflammatory
    
    Infectious: TB, Histoplasmosis, Cryptococcosis,   
                Coccidioidomycosis, Nocardiosis
                Pneumonia, Lung Abscess, Hydatid cyst

    Noninfectious: Sarcoid, Rheumatoid Arthritis, 
                   Caplan’s Syndrome, 

3.  Congenital: Arteriovenous Malformation,  
                Sequestration, Lung Cyst, 
                Bronchial Atresia with mucoid impaction

4.  Vascular: Wegener’s granulomatosis, Behcet’s   
              Disease, Hematoma, Kaposi’s Sarcoma, 
              Pulmonary Infarct, Septic Infarcts

5.  Miscellaneous: Round Atelectasis, Intrapulmonary  
                   Lymph Node, Progressive Massive   
                   Fibrosis, Mucoid Impaction,  
                   Amyloidosis, First Costochondro  
                   Junction
The patient was asymptomatic and presented after abnormalities were incidentally found in her right lung after a virtual colonoscopy was performed.
Nearly 90% of cases of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVM’s) are associated with Rendu-Osler-Weber disease.  Rendu-Osler-Weber disease is also known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.  Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is even more likely when AVM’s are multiple as in this case.  The fact that this patient did not have a history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia  makes this case somewhat atypical.

This patient was virtually asymptomatic; however, patient’s with AVM’s may present with hypoxia and orthodeoxia.  Orthodeoxia is when patients experience shortness of breath while sitting up.  The shortness of breath occurs because AVM’s have a predilection for the lower lung zones where shunting is increased in the upright position.  Other presenting symptoms which were not present in this include embolic phenomena, clubbing, polycythemia, hemoptysis, and cyanosis.
