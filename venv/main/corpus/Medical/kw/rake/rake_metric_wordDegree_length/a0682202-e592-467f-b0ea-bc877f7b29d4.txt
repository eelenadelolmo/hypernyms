Due to the size of the mass and the presentation with acute hemorrhage, treatment was indicated.  The patient underwent selective catheter based embolization of the lesion.
• Contrast enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates a large enhancing mass in the left kidney.  The mass has multiple foci of fat density.  Area of increased density within the mass is consistent with hemorrhage.

• Catheter angiogram shows large mass feed by interlobar artery with prominent neovascularity and delayed washout.

• Post-embolization images show absent flow to the mass.
Angiomyolipoma
• Angiomyolipoma
• Renal cell carcinoma surrounding renal sinus fat
22 y/o woman presents with acute left sided abdominal pain.
This woman was known to have Tuberous Sclerosis (TS).  AML occurs in a majority of TS patients, though often small and uncomplicated.  

Symptoms rarely occur in patients with AMLs less than 4cm in size.  Tumors greater than 4cm are symptomatic 80-90% of the time and 50-60% bleed spontaneously.

Embolization of angiomyolipomas is an effective, minimally invasive treatment.  The technical success rate is near 100%.  Recurrence (increase in size >2cm on follow-up imaging and/or recurrent symptoms requiring repeat embolization) is rare in sporadic AMLs. The recurrence rate is higher in patients with TS and lifelong imaging is recommended.
