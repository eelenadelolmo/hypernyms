Physical Exam within normal limits except for tenderness throughout the abdomen with rebound. On pelvic exam cervical motion tenderness was absent;but, there is a mucopurulent discharge from the cervical os.

Labs: 
1.Lipase: 2044(outside facility) down to 21 second day of admission 
2.Amylase:125
3.Urinalysis:Positive for leukocyte esterase
4.Urine Culture:Day 1 grew 30,000 - 40,000 Group B Strep
PCR for Chlamydia:Positive
PCR for Gonorrhea:Positive
RPR: non reactive
HIV: negative
BMP: WNL
Lipid panel: Total cholesterol: 78, TG 42, HDL 30, VLDL 8
MRCP showed no signs of pancreatitis - but with fluid in the pericholecystic space and in the right paracolic gutter. Given these findings, a diagnosis of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome was established. The patient was started on IV Cefoxitine and PO Doxycycline. Her abdominal pain resolved after 24 hours of Cefoxitine, and she was discharged with 12 days remaining of 100mg of oral doxycycline twice daily. This was reported to the County health board to try to get hold of the sexual contacts. No follow-up at this time.
U/S: Mildly distended common bile duct.Borderline to mild splenomegaly.

MRCP without contrast: A small right pleural effusion and a small amount of fluid in the pericholecystic space and also in the right paracolic gutter.
Of note there is no evidence of fluid around the pancreas or a pancreatic pseudocyst. The pancreatic duct is not prominent of the common duct is slightly prominent at 5 mm.

13 y.o. girl was awakened out of sleep at 2 am by a sharp 10/10 stabbing pain that radiated to her back. She denied fevers, rigors, or vomiting.  The pain remains constant since developing. She was referred from an outside facility with a diagnosis of pancreatitis, because her labs there were reported to be abnormal.  (The lipase was 2044 and the amylase 125,  10-15 WBCs and moderate leukesterase on UA.)   There is a family history of gallbladder disease, she denies alcohol use, and no family history of cystic fibrosis.  She  is sexually active, but denies dysuria, polyuria, diarrhea, dyspareunia, vaginal discharge.  Her last menses was 1 week ago and was normal.  She has had two sexual partners, and the last coitus episode was 2 weeks ago.  Her mother has CAD diagnosed under 50 y.o. and is believed to have hyperlipidemia.
With the initial lipase of 2044 the admitting team was concerned for possible gall stone pancreatitis. However, repeat lipase was down to 66, postive PCR for GC and Chlyamydia, and the findings of MRCP (done to evaluate pancreatitis) the diagnosis of Fitz-Hugh Curtis Syndrome was made.  http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/256448-overview
