Vitals:
â€¢ HR: 164bpm
â€¢ RR: 28
â€¢ Heart rate normal
â€¢ regular rhythm
â€¢ heart sounds normal
â€¢ nasal congestion
â€¢ dyspnea
â€¢ fever
surgical correction
â€¢ double aortic arch creating complete vascular ring with right arch dominance measuring 7mm in diameter and left arch measuring 5mm in diameter
â€¢ right arch ascends 6mm higher than left
â€¢ right carotid and subclavian aa arise from right arch and left carotid and subclavian aa arise from left arch.
â€¢ trachea and esophagus are constrained; maximum constraint by vascular ring results in trachea with reduced diameter from 4.5mm to 2mm and a completely collapsed esophagus
â€¢ small azygous lobe
â€¢ right middle lobe consolidation
Double aortic arch
â€¢ tracheoesophageal fistula/esophageal atresia
â€¢ double aortic arch-vascular ring
Patient is a 20-month old infant girl with a history of gagging while eating solid foods and cyanotic spells. There is no significant past medical history.
