The patient is a well-developed, muscular, well-nourished white man in no apparent distress.  There is a palpable mass of the distal right anterior thigh. He weighs 214# and is 5'11" tall.  There is no palpable lymphadenopathy in the neck, supraclavicular, or axillary areas.
Excisional biopsy of soft tissue mass was performed. Gross specimens consisted of one ovoid fragment of tan/pink, rubbery, glistening tissue measuring 5.1 x 3.3 x 1.5 cm. The specimen grossly appears to be enveloped by a tan/pink fibrous tissue capsule, which is focally disrupted in one area. The specimen is inked and serially sectioned to reveal homogeneous tan/pink, rubbery, glistening, cut surface. Histology  showed positive margins.   There were lobules of myxoid change, an "alveolar" or "pulmonary edema"-like pattern, delicate plexiform (Y-shaped) capillaries, and multiple small lipoblasts (many bi or uni-vacuolated, some multivacuolated.  One month later, because of the positive margins, the patient underwent resection of the excision site (margins negative for residual sarcoma) followed by radiation therapy.Follow-up (5 months after second resection), follow-up contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed no metastases.  The MR image of the right femur showed interval resection of the previously noted intramuscular mass along with the mid-to-lower portions of the rectus femoris muscle, with a new tubular fluid collection in the surgical bed, probably representing a postoperative hygroma. Close interval MR follow-up of this area was recommended. The Physical Exam demonstrated a 20cm scar in the anterolateral right thigh from just above the knee to just below the groin.  Therwas a soft tissue defect in the area of the resection.
PLAIN RADIOGRAPH: A-P and lateral views of the right femur from 7/9/2002 demonstrate no bone abnormalities.  No soft tissue abnormalities are evident. MRI: A right rectus femoris mass measuring 4.5x2.4x2.5cm shows intermediate- signal intensity periphery with low-signal-intensity center on T1-weighted MR images and predominantly high signal intensity mass on T2-weighted MR image with low-signal-intensity septae posteriorly. After contrast-enhancement, there is a thick rim of peripheral enhancement with non-enhancing areas centrally. These findings were consistent with a myxoid liposarcoma.
MYXOID LIPOSARCOMA
Myxoid liposarcoma, Myxoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma
34-year-old male with self-palpated slowly growing right thigh mass just above the knee. Mass painful with percussion.
