Texto: 
â€¢ Febrile and disoriented
â€¢ Lumbar puncture requested
â€¢ IV acyclovir for 2 weeks.
â€¢ Patient asymptomatic at time of follow-up scan 6 weeks after treatment
â€¢ August MRI- Mass lesion in left temporal lobe, with edema but no contrast enhancement.  Best seen on FLAIR MRI.


â€¢ November MRI- ring-like enhancement in left temporal lobe.  FLAIR images are not remarkable
Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSV2)
â€¢ Tumor
â€¢ Trauma
â€¢ Infection - abscess vs encephalitis vs meningoencephalitis
â€¢ Post-ictal changes
43 year old woman presents with seizure.
History of 4 days of headache, nausea and vomiting
It is interesting that in the acute phase of the infection there was no enhancement on MRI. PCR on CSF confirmed HSV2, not the more common (90%) HSV1 ("oral" herpes labialis).

Three months after appropriate treatment, the edema and mass effect resolved but there is blood barrier disruption that was not seen on presentation in the acute phase.  Herpes survivors may show persistent abnormalities on MRI - despite clinical recovery.
