Tenderness to palpation of the right dorsal midfoot
A bone scan performed with 25 mCi of Tc99m-MDP demonstrates focal, intensely increased uptake in the right cuboid bone in the area of tenderness.  Mildly increased uptake in bilateral sessamoid bones is consistent with stress reactive changes.
Stress fracture
1)Stress fracture
2)Infection (osteomyelitis)
3)Osteonecrosis
41 year old female runner with right foot pain for three weeks.
The bone scan appearance after a fracture may be divided into acute, subacute, and healing phases.  The acute phase usually lasts from 3-4 weeks and demonstrates a generalized diffuse increase in activity in the region of the fracture.  The subacute phase follows and lasts 2-3 months with the activity more localized and intense.  The healing phase may occur over a longer period and is accompanied by a gradual decline in activity.

Subtle trauma, such as a stress fracture, is often difficult to visualize on a plain radiograph.  Often such fractures are not visualized for 7-10 days.  Bone scans are frequently positive at the time of clinical presentation.  The time of initial appearance of an area of increased activity at a fracture site is age dependent.  Older patients may not show increased activity for several days.  In young patients, increased uptake can be seen in the first 24 hours.

A focus of intensely increased uptake in the right cuboid bone is consistent with an occult stress fracture with a given patient's history.  The differential diagnosis would also include infection and osteonecrosis.  The mild increased uptake in the sesamoid bones is consistent with stress reactive changes.
