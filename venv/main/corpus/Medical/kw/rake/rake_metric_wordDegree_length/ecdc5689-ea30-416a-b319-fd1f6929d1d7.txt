Texto: 
Palpable left thyroid nodule.
No treatment needed since symptoms were not severe.
Barium swallow reveals a smooth, prominent posterior impression on the cervical esophagus at the C5-6 level.
 
Also note the barium in the nasopharynx which occurred during swallowing.  This is a good example of nasopharyngeal reflux with failure of the soft palate and uvula to approximate the posterior pharynx.
Cricopharyngeal Achalasia
83 y/o female with new left thyroid nodule complains of dysphagia.
