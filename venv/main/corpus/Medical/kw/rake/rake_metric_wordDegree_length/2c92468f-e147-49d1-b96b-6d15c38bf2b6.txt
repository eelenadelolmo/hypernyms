5 y/o boy for follow-up
This patient has colpocephaly, which is abnormal enlargement of occipital horns of the lateral ventricle secondary to decreased white matter and is therefore ex vacuo change.  It most commonly associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum.  This condition is often misdiagnosed as hydrocephalus.  Note the absence of CSF transependymal flow which would be a sign of hydrocephalus.
