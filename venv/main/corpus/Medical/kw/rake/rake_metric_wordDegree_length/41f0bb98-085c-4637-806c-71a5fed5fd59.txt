Texto: 
Firm implants bilaterally with no concerning palpable nodule. Physical exam difficult secondary to breast augmentation.
Surgical removal of implant
Mammogram: Bilateral subglandular implants in place.  There is calcification of the implant capsule which is unchanged from the comparison study two years prior. There is a dense nodule in the lower half of the left breast abutting the implant which has increased in size from the comparison study.
However, this is seen on only one view.  No other suspicious masses or architectural distortion.  No suspicious cluster of microcalcifications are seen in either breast.

MR: Low signal is present around both breast prostheses on all imaging sequences consistent with calcification as seen in previous mammograms. A focal bulge is present on the left breast lateral aspect extending superiorly. Small area of signal intensity consistent with implant is in an extracapsular location at the inferior and superior aspects of the implant. Intracapsular degenerative changes bilaterally, age indeterminate.
Breast implant,  rupture, extracapsular silicone of age indeterminate
Extracapsular silicone and intracapsular rupture
Breast Cancer
History of breast augmentation in the 1970's with focal bulge inferior left breast.
Breast MR is an appropriate study for evaluation of intra/extracapsular silicone rupture, especially in this case where cancer could also be considered in a differential of an enlarging mass
