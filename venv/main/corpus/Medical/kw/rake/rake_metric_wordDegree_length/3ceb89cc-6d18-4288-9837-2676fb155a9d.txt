Generalized neck pain without focal tenderness.
Extended immobilization, with uneventful recovery.
• C1 - Jefferson burst fracture of C1 with comminution of the mid anterior ring and comminution of the left posterolateral ring.  
• C2 - Predominately coronally-oriented fracture of the posterior C2 body with an additional left parasagittal C2 body fracture component. This fracture extends into the left foramen transversalis.  There is also a minimally displaced right occipital condyle fracture and an extension tear-drop fracture located at the anterior inferior margin of the C2 vertebral body.
Combined Jefferson and Hangman's fractures
• Jefferson Fracture: 
  Congenital variants, malformations
  Rotational malalignment of Atlas/Axis pillars  
  Pseudospread of Atlas (in children)

• Hangman’s Fracture:
  Pseudosubluxation
  Rotatory subluxation of C2-C3
  Primary spondylosis

A Jefferson fracture, also known as a C1 (atlas) burst fracture, is a compression fracture of the C1 arch. The best diagnostic clue is lateral displacement of both articular masses of C1 from those of C2 on open mouth radiograph.  Any lateral spread of the C1 pillars on open mouth radiograph requires CT.  Separation between the dens and C1 anterior arch can also be seen.  Axial CT best defines the fracture components.  Jefferson fractures are typically stable, unless the transverse ligament is avulsed.  Combined fractures do occur (as in this case).  The mechanism of injury is compressive force applied at the vertex (ie diving) which results in bone fragments being blown away from the cord.

A Hangman’s fracture is a traumatic spondylolisthesis of C2 (Axis).  Any anterior subluxation of C2 on C3 on lateral radiograph warrants CT.  The classical mechanism of injury is a hanging with the knot in the submental position producing complete disruption of C2, C3 disc, and ligaments.  Chin v dashboard is a much more common contemporary trauma history, which produces a similar mechanism (hyperextension and axial loading).  Extension into the vertebral artery foramen raises the possibility of vertebral artery damage.  Delayed stroke is a possibility if vertebral artery is damaged.  Additional fractures are seen at other levels in 1/3 of cases, with C1 fractures being most common (again, as in this case).
