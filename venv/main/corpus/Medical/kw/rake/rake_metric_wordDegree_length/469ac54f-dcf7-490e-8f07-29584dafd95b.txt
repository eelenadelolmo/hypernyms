IV/VI holosystolic murmur heard best at the right upper-sternal border
CT measurement of the stenotic pulmonary valve with regurgitant cross-sectional area of 0.16cm2 and characteristic dilatation of main and left pulmonary arteries with normal right pulmonary artery.  

In this patient with mild, asymptomatic, pulmonary valve stenosis with pressure gradiant >30mmHg is monitored with survelliance echocardiograhpy every 2-3 years, as per the 2008 ACC/AHA adult congenital heart disease guidelines.
Chest radiograph findings:
- Left mediastinal mass, a prominent pulmonary artery

Cardiac gated CT (with and without contrast) findings:
- Enlarged main pulmonary artery measuring 4.4cm
- Enlarged left pulmonary artery measuring 3.9cm
- Normal right pulmonary artery measuring 2.2 cm
- Pulmonary valve stenosis without subpulmonic membrane. Pulmonary valve is diffusely thickened. 

There is incomplete coaptation of the valve in diastole with a regurgitant area of 0.16 cm2.
- Enlarged inferior vena cava
Pulmonary valve stenosis
• Pulmonary valve stenosis
• Chronic pulmonary hypertension
• Pulmonary artery aneurysm
• Idiopathic pulmonary artery dilation
21 y.o. asymptomatic man with an  incidental finding on a screening chest radiograph
Please see the linked disease topic  for general discussion of a dilated pulmonary artery.
