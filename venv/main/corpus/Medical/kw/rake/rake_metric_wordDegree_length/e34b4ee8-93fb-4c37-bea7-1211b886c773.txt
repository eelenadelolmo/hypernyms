Chemotherapy and radiation
Multiple bilateral lesions which are high signal on T2 sequences, low signal on T1 sequences and with minimal mass effect.  Some of the lesions reveal restricted diffusion on DWI images.  The lesions enhance irregularly.
Intravascular Lymphoma (Large cell) lymphoma, of the B-cell phenotype (CD20 positive).
• Metastatic disease
• Septic emboli
• Sarcoidosis
• ADEM
• Aggressive MS
• Multifocal Glioma
38 year old man with a clinical diagnosis of MS.  Treated with high dose steroids for two months.  Now presents with obtundation, visual loss, and bilateral extremity weakness.
Intravascular Lymphoma is also called Angiocentric Lymphoma.  Restricted diffusion - as is seen here - is typical in highly cellular lesions such as lymphoma; and, this finding is uncommon in multiple sclerosis.

It is possible that the clinical diagnosis of MS was incorrect and the confusing mixture of neurologic problems were related to the intravascular lymphoma.
