Follow-up MRI three weeks later revealed subtotal resolution of many of the lesions. This is consistent with the monophasic illness of most patients with ADEM.
Multiple enhancing brain lesions with increased T2 signal intensity. Lesions involve cerebral white matter, gray matter, and cerebellum. No mass effect. No restricted diffusion. Minimal enhancement.
Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis
• Multiple Sclerosis
• Multiple infarcts
• Sickle Cell Disease
• ADEM (Acute disseminated encephalo-myelitis)
