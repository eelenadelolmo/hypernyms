Initial exam was 1 day post-incident (April 2011) and revealed the following: » Limited Active ROM in the cervical spine with report of moderate-to-severe pain radiating from right side of neck to RUE with right lateral bending and right/left rotation. - Flexion to 70 degrees (normal = 65) - Extension to 25 degrees (normal = 75) - Right and Left Lateral bending to 30 degrees (normal = 45) - Right and Left Rotation to 60 degrees (normal = 90) » + Cervical Distraction test for relief of symptomatology » + Cervical Compression testing (Spurling's Maneuver) in an extended position with right cervical rotation reveals pain radiating from right cervical spine to RUE to the first phalange of first digit. » Grip Strength testing with Jamar Dynamometer shows: -Right Hand 55 lbs of pressure - Left hand 80 lbs of pressure » Limited strength in RUE rated 4/5 in Right Biceps. Right supraspinatus rated 4/5 with reproduction of pain. » Increased muscle tonicity over Right levator scapula and right trapezius » Cervical spine hypomobility » Tenderness on deep palpation over lower cervical spine and right shoulder. » + Neer's test @ 90 degrees » + Right Hawkins-Kennedy Test » + Right Supraspinatus test Electrodiagnostic Exam is available from July 2011 with the following findings and impression: Findings: 1. Normal distal motor latencies and amplitudes of the left and right Median, Ulanr, and Radial nerves. 2. Normal F-responses of the right and left Median, Ulnar, and Radial Nerves 3. Normal distal sensory latencies and amplitudes of left and right Ulnar and Radial nerves. 4. Abnormal distal sensory peak latencies of the left and right Median Nerves (mild prolongation). 5. Abnormal left and right "Numb Thumb" Radial to Median comparative studies 6. Abnormal monopolar needle EMG examination of teh right upper limb and right cervical paraspinal muscles. Impression: 1. Active Right C6 radiculopathy. 2. Mild bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome affecting only the sensory fibers. 3. No electrophysiological evidence of brachial plexopathy, diffuse neuropathy, or myopathy was observed.
Pt has been evaluated by orthopedic surgeon but prefers to continue with conservative treatment. As such patient is being treated with Chiropractic modalities three times per week with concurrent Physical Therapy once weekly. Chiropractic treatment includes cervical traction and Spinal Manipulative Therapy in the office with Pronex cervical traction unit being utilized at home.

Patient prefers to continue current treatment modalities as long as symptomatic benefits are achieved. Follow-up is scheduled with orthopedic surgeon to evaluate condition and progress in 6-8 weeks.
MRI of Cervical Spine (August 2011)
• Incidental expansion of sella turcica with cystic changes
• Reversal of Cervical lordosis at C3-C5
•C4-C5: Disc Space narrowing, spondylosis and diffucse posterior protrusion more prominent on the right with mild encroachment of right neural foramina.
• C5-C6: Disc space narrowing and diffuse posterior bulge/protrusion.

C-Spine X-rays (September 2011)
• Loss of normal lordosis
• Advanced loss of disc space height @ C3-C5
• Mild loss of disc space height @ C5-C7
• No instability with Flexion/Extension
• No fractures
Cervical Disc Herniation with Radiculopathy
• Cervial sprain/strain
• Cervical Radiculopathy
• Cervical disc herniation
• Shoulder impingement/Rotator Cuff Syndrome
• Peripheral neuropathy
April 2011:

Pt is a 56 y/o AA female with PMH significant for HTN who presented for chiropractic evaluation and treatment following a work-related injury which occurred the previous day.

Per patient, she was moving linens to stock a hospital cart when she felt a sudden onset of right-sided neck pain shooting through her right shoulder, down her right arm to her hand. She was seen in the ER at her place of employment and sent home with NSAIDs and was limited to light-duty at work.

Pt reports no prior history of neck or back pain.

With conservative treatment, Patient reports relief of her symptoms and increased benefit over time from use of her home cervical-traction unit (Pronex).

As of October 2011, Patient has still not proceeded with surgery.
