Fetal growth parameters corresponded with period of gestation and amniotic fluid was adequate.
The placenta was on the posterior uterine wall and showed a well-marginated, hypoechoic mass measuring 6 x 6.4cm(Fig. 1). Color Doppler showed increased vascularity of the mass, in the central and peripheral portions (Fig. 2). Only arterial flow was detected (Fig. 3). Umbilical and uterine artery flow indices were normal. Follow-up scan after four weeks showed an increase in the size of the mass, which now measured 9 x 8 cm. The amniotic fluid was slightly increased in volume, with mild IUGR and mild pericardial effusion (fig 4). The patient went into premature labor at 35 weeks and delivered a male baby weighing 2.1 kg by cesarian section. 
Histopathological examination of the placenta proved the mass to be a chorioangioma.

Huge hypoechoic placental mass developped at the fetal surface of the placental disk and displaying central and peripheral vessels  with arterial flow characteristics.
Giant placental chorioangioma highly suspected by color doppler study and confirmed by histopatholoic examination
If color doppler study shows vascularity within the tumor the  differential diagnosis is only with the exceptional arteriovenous anastomosis.
If  no intratumoral vascularity  depicted the differential diagnosis is with :
  -intrachorionic  hematoma
  -trophoblastic cyst
  -subamniotic hematoma
  -hydatiform mole
A twenty-six-years old female third gravida  with history of two prior caesarean sections was referred for routine antenatal ultrasound scan at 20 weeks of gestation
Chorioangioma is a primary benign tumor with predominantly vascular involvement. It is found in 1% of all placentas undergoing careful and systematic histopathological examination. The preferred localisation is on the fetal side of the placental disk and it may protrude into the amniochorial cavity; the volume is variable (but rarely exceeds a maximum diameter of 4-5 cm). 

A rarer form is the clinically relevant large chorioangioma which is likely to be associated with complications like polyhydramnios, pre-term birth, IUGR, anemia, fetal congested heart decompensation, non-immune fetal hydrops, perinatal mortality. 
Hydrops fetalis due to a large chorioangioma is a rare complication. Our patient's fetus had only pericardial effusion without prominent signs of fetal hydrops. 

There are only few reports of color and pulse Doppler assessment of placental chorioangioma. While Grundy et al [1] and Hirata et al [2] found only arterial blood flow in the chorioangioma, Kung et al [3] did not find any vascularity in one patient and only peripheral venous flow in the second. Our study showed both central and peripheral flow with only arterial characteristics. In patients with fetal and/or maternal complications, color Doppler may play a role in demonstrating the blood flow inside the mass. As for those without complications and with little or no blood flow, it is of limited use. 
With the increasing use of ultrasound, prenatal diagnosis of these tumors is becoming more common(4).

Management includes umblical blood sampling and intravascular transfusion for fetal anemia which temporarily corrects the hydrops and significantly prolongs the pregnancy(5). Ablation of the blood supply of plancental chorioangioma via operative fetoscopy is another management alternative in patients with large chorioangioma(5).
