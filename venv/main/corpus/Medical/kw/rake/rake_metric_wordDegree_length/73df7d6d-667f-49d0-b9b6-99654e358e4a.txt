No significant physical exam findings.
Surgical resection and started on chemotherapy
Focal wall thickening (11mm) of a segment of jejunum in the left upper quadrant.  This segment of jejunum is also dilated with a maximum diameter of 5.3 cm with retained contrast and an air-fluid level.  Also noted is surrounding lymphadenopathy and peritoneal fat stranding, the largest mesenteric lymphnode measuring 1.3cm in its shortest diameter.

Active duty soldier with three week history of nausea, vomiting, and epigastric abdominal pain while deployed in Iraq.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the most common malignancy of the small bowel, representing 20% of small bowel malignancies.  It most often occurs in males between 50 to 60 years old and occurs most often in the distal ileum.  Prognosis is worse for younger patients and females.   Immunocompromised patients have an increased frequency of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma of the small bowel.

The radiographic appearance of small bowel varies to include fold thickening or effacement, luminal narrowing, diffuse nodularity, extrinsic compression by mesenteric masses, and most often marked luminal dilatation.  Lymphoma of the small intestine may also present as an ulcerating mass.  Diagnosis of primary small bowel lymphoma is made by the presence of an isolated small bowel lesion and regional lymphadenopathy without splenic, hematologic, or hepatic involvment.  

The differential diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin includes adenocarcinoma, carcinoid tumor, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, lipoma, metastases, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.  Imaging modalities include fluoroscopy, CT, and MRI.

The diagnosis can be suggested with imaging when focal thickening of a bowel loop associated with "aneurysmal dilatation" of the segment and regional lymphadenopathy is seen, as on this case.
