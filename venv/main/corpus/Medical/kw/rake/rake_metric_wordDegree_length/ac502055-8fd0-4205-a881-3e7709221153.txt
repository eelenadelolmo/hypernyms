N/A
Patient was admitted to the ward for evaluation by Neurology.  He was not a candidate for thrombolysis because this was a completed infarct - without a potentially salvageable penumbra.
Noncontrast CT of the head demonstrates loss of gray white matter differentiation in the right parietal lobe.

A subsequent diffusion weighted MRI of the brain was acquired demonstrating restricted diffusion - bright on DWI and dark on ADC map.
Acute cerebral infarction
Acute cerebral infarction
83 y.o. man with a new onset of slurred speech and left upper extremity weakness.  Rule out acute intracranial hemorrhage. Patient is on anticoagulation; and; he has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and prostate cancer.
CT did not demonstrate acute intracranial hemorrhage. Decreased attenuation of the the brain parenchyma, on unenhanced CT, is a sign of acute infarction.   The subsequent diffusion weighted MR sequence confirmed the acuity of the infarct.  The images did not demonstrate a hyperdense MCA sign.  Subsequent MR angiography of the brain and neck did not show hemodynamically significant pathology.  Contemporary plain CT is a valuable modality in the evaluation of acute intracranial pathology.
