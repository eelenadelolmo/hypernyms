Physical examination reveals no focal neurologic deficit.
The patient underwent tumor resection and is being followed up with serial brain MRI scans to assess for tumor recurrence or tumor progression to a higher grade astrocytoma.
Multiplanar MR Imaging demonstrates the presence of a T1 hypointense and T2 , FLAIR hyperintense mass lesion in the medial part of the right frontal lobe. The mass does not enhance after gadolinium administration and exhibits no diffusion restriction. The lesion causes mass effect on the corpus callosum, the lateral ventricles and the left frontal lobe. 

Almost two months following surgical resection of the right frontal mass, postoperative postcontrast T1 weighted images demonstrate no overt findings of residual or recurrent tumor.

A 38 y.o. woman presents with a 5-month history of seizures and  gradual onset of behavioral changes.
Advanced MR Imaging , such as Dynamic Susceptiblity Contrast MR Imaging and/or MR Spectrocopy , was not used in this case, for unknown reasons. Nevertheless, the morphologic-anatomic imformation derived from T2-weighted images, FLAIR images and T1-weighted images (conventional imaging) , the contrast-enhancement features and the information about molecular diffusion (DWI)  are very important findings and more compatible with a low grade primary brain neoplasm (Low Grade Astrocytoma - LGA).
A major differential diagnosis problem would be anaplastic astrocytoma (AA). It is  difficult to distinguish AA from LGA on the basis of imaging findings alone. Definitive diagnosis would require biopsy.
