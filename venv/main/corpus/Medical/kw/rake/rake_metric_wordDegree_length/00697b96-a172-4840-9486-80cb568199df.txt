Texto: 
The lateral aspect of the proximal calf and left knee were warm to touch with tenderness elicited at the tibial tuberosity and pain within the joint space upon manipulation and ballottement of the patella. There was compromised range of motion of the left knee, both passive and active, secondary to pain and guarding.  All other aspects of the exam were unremarkable.
Intraoperative frozen section analysis of bone biopsy obtained under fluoroscopic guidance was concerning for malignant small round cell tumor.  The formal pathology report listed Ewing Sarcoma as the most likely diagnosis. Immunostains revealed strong membranous CD99 staining and were negative for myogenin, S-100, cytokeratin, CD45, TdT, CD20, and CD3.  Chromosome analysis a normal female karyotype of 46,XX. No clonal abnormal cells were identified.

Treatment: The patient was enrolled in the Childrenâ€™s Oncology Group metastatic Ewings protocol with randomization between autologous transplant and standard therapy, or standard therapy alone with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. She was admitted to the inpatient oncology unit and began anti-neoplastic therapy per protocol AEWS0331 with Vincristine, Ifosfamide + Mesna, Doxyrubicin, and Etoposide (VIDE).

Follow-up: The patient completed six rounds of cyctoreductive therapy per AEWS0331 VAI protocol.  No pulmonary nodule was detected on follow-up CT after the second VIDE cycle. She is set to undergo limb reconstructive surgery for local control upon arrival of her custom prosthetic implant from Europe. High dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue is a therapy option which may benefit her in the future as the patient underwent stem cell harvest after her second cycle of chemotherapy.
XR Knee: Lucent poorly defined lesion involving the proximal tibial diaphysis, with a moth-eaten appearance and irregular zone of transition proximally and thickening of the cortex of the lateral tibial diaphysis. There is also periostial reaction extending superior to this along the lateral aspect of the proximal tibial metaphysis, and at the inferior aspect of the lesion, there is an apparent Codmanâ€™s triangle. There is also bowing deformity of the proximal tibia, apex medial. There is suggestion of very subtle periosteal reaction of the fibular diaphysis.

CXR: Increased pulmonary markings with no focal infiltrates. No clear evidence of metastases or malignancy is seen. 

MRI (left tib/fib): Large aggressive appearing lesion involving the proximal and mid tibia, its periosteum, and the surrounding soft tissues including adjacent musculature, with probable involvement of the proximal fibular cortex. Soft tissue abnormalities extend down to the level of the distal tibial metaphysis. The soft tissue component of the tumor measures 4.4 cm transverse x 4.8 cm AP x 8.1cm craniocaudal. There is disruption and partial destruction of the proximal tibial cortex adjacent to the soft tissue component described above.

Nuc bone scan: Abnormal tracer accumulation is present in the left tibia from the proximal metaphysis to the mid diaphysis.   

CT chest/abd/pelvis: Nine millimeter nodular density in the left lung apex with a second three millimeter density in the right lower lobe. Several right lower quadrant mesenteric masses measuring up to fifteen millimeters are consistent with mesenteric lymph nodes.

A nine-year-old girl with no significant past medical history presented with localized left lateral calf pain of one month duration. There was increased pain with mild swelling, warmth to touch, and limping noted three days prior to presentation.  Two days later progression of the patient*s calf pain with refusal to bear weight and a concomitant low-grade fever prompted a visit to the emergency department at an outside facility where a radiograph of the knee showed a bony irregularity with soft tissue swelling to the left tibia.
