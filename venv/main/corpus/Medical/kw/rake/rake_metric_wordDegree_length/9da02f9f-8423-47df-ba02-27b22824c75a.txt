Treatment largely depends on the nature and severity of the clinical presentation.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and local heat application and range-of-motion exercises are core treatments.  Local corticosteroid injections may be beneficial.  Needle aspiration or surgical removal of the deposit may be appropriate in patients unresponsive to other treatments.
AP radiograph of the left shoulder reveals large calcific deposits in the region of the distal supraspinatus tendon, the most common site of hydroxyapatite deposition.
AP radiograph of the left hip demonstrate calcific deposits adjacent to greater trochanter of the femur in the region of the gluteus medius consistent with hydroxyapatite deposition disease

35-year-old female presented with a 10 year history of shoulder and left hip pain.  Pain was worse with abduction and had increased substantially over the past year.
Hydroxyapatite deposition disease (HADD) is an idiopathic disorder characterized by intra- and/or peri-articular deposits of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals, especially in or around the tendons.  The shoulder is the most commonly affected joint with the deposition often occurring within the supraspinatus tendon and other tendons of the rotator cuff.  Other common sites include the hip, knee, elbow and facet joints and bursae of the lumbar spine, though HADD can affect most joints.  The deposits are often monoarticular in distribution.  

HADD occurs in up to 3% of adults between the ages of 40 and 70 years with a slightly higher frequency in men than women.  Clinically, HADD is characterized by recurrent episodes of pain, swelling, erythema, and tenderness around the affected joint.  There may be a varying degree of disability.  Some patients may by asymptomatic.   

The natural history of HADD is progressive, although all stages may not be apparent.  An initial, silent stage is characterized by calcific deposits in the tendons.  During this time the patient is often asymptomatic.  As the deposits collect they increase in size and the disease enters a mechanical stage whereby the deposits may rupture with subbursal or intrabursal extravasion and the patient may experience an acute painful inflammatory reaction and painful attack.  In some cases the inflammation can lead to bone erosion, adhesive bursitis, and/or joint destruction.  However in other patients the disease has resolved spontaneously or following treatment with NSAIDS
Radiographically, the features of hydroxyapatite deposits depend on the stage of involvement.  Initially they may appear as amorphous, cloud-like densities.  Over time deposits may become denser with more delineated borders and a linear or ovoid configuration.  A useful distinguishing characteristic of HADD is the globular appearance of calcium deposition in or around the tendons, as opposed to the linear configuration of calcium deposition in within the cartilage and menisci associated with calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease.  The location of deposition is also a useful indicator of HADD with the most common sites of deposition involving the shoulder and hip.
