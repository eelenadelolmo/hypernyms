Unremarkable pelvic exam.
Patient to undergo endometrial biopsy to remove polyps.
Transvaginal ultrasound demonstrates an area of focal thickening of the endometrial stripe. On subsequent sonohysterography, two well-defined, smooth, polypoid lesions, isoechoic to the endometrium are seen extending into the endometrial canal.
Endometrial Polyps
- Endometrial polyp(s)
- Submucosal fibroid(s)
- Glandular hyperplasia
41 y/o female with irregular menstrual bleeding.
Endometrial polyps are a common cause of dysfunctional uterine bleeding and can be seen in 30% of cases of dysfunctional uterine bleeding.  This patient had two endometrial polyps that were seen on sonohysterography.  Multiple polyps are seen in aproximately 20% of cases.
