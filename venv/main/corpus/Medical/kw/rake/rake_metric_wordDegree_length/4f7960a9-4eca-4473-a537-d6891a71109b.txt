Normal triple screen.  No leak of fluid detected on examination.
Multiple ultrasound images obtained of the gravid uterus.  The ability to discern anatomy of the fetus is poor despite the mothers fairly small body habitus.  There is an overall appearance of the fetus being crammed into the uterus with very minimal surrounding amniotic fluid.  A transverse image is provided of the lower thorax / upper retroperitoneum in the typical location for visualization of the kidneys.  It is difficult to clearly make out the kidneys, possibly secondary to overall poor sound transmission.  There is clearly no hydronephrosis, ascites or distended bladder seen on the images.
Bilateral Renal Agenesis
Fetal Demise - Not provided with these images but a fetal heart beat with normal heart rate was present.

Renal anomaly / lack of function.

IUGR

Premature rupture of membranes
23 y/o woman with first uncomplicated pregnancy presenting for anatomic screening ultrasound
It can be difficult at times to clearly tell wheter kidneys are present when sound transmission is poor as the kidneys can be relatively isoechoic to surrounding tissues.  Some techniques that help are to increase the delta for imaging and reduce dynamic range to attempt to increase the contrast with adjacent tissues.  Also helpful is using doppler color to demonstrate the presence or absence of a renal artery heading into the region.  In addition, turning sagital or coronal on what is thought to be the kidney will often clear up any confusion about wheter what is being imaged is a psoas muscle or a small kidney.  

In this case, the kidneys were unable to be identified.
