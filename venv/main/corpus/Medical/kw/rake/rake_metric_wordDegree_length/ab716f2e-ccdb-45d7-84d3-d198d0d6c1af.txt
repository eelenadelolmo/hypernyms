Presentation:
Active range of motion of cervical spine with flexion accomplished to 60/60, right and left rotation each to 60/80, left and right lateral bending each to 25/25 and extension to 45/60. 
Cervical distraction and compression testing was unremarkable. 
Active range of motion of the shoulders. 
Muscle strengths of the upper extremities revealed a weakness on the right side with strength at 4/5 for all muscle groups including deltoid, wrist extensors, external rotators of right shoulder, supraspinatus and triceps. 
Diminished grip strength of the right shoulder with both extension (11.8 lb) and flexion (15.6 lb), compare to the left (14.4 lb, 39.5 lb). 
Positive Neer and Hawkins impingement tests and supraspinatus tendon test on the right shoulder, with pain elicited.
Biceps reflex ? on the left and 2/4 on the right.
Triceps reflex 2/4 bilaterally.
Deep palpation revealed tenderness about the right anteromedial shoulder.
Chiropractic manipulative therapy for pain reduction and relief of any cervical neural embarassment. As patient did not demonstrate any positive findings with the Spurling maneuver, cervical MRI was not ordered despite the overlapping symptomatology. Pain management with opiate pain management program by primary care physician. No surgical intervention is indicated at this time as patientâ€™s MRI findings remain controversial for rotator cuff tear vs tendinopathy.
MRI of right shoulder 2/29/2012
Extensive supraspinatus tendinopathy. There is a linear injury at site of attachment of the tendon. Infraspinatus tendinopathy without evidence of a tear. Advanced osteoathrosis of the AC joint which encroaches on the rotator cuff outlet.
rotator cuff tendinopathy vs cervical radiculopathy
Rotator cuff tendinopathy
Partial thickness rotator cuff tear
Cervical radiculopathy
Subacromial bursitis
Acromioclavicular osteoarthritis
Glenoid labrum tear
65 yr old African American male with history of left foot fracture in 2005, right ankle fracture s/p surgical repair in 1995, and DM type II presented with pain in left knee, neck, lower back and left lower extremity after an alleged MVA. He denies any loss of bowel or bladder control.

As patientâ€™s initial presentation consists of pain at multiple sites including neck and shoulder, and that shoulder pain may be produced by different etiologies, possible cervical radiculopathy as well as rotator cuff disorders must both be considered. To rule out a cervical etiology, Spurlingâ€™s maneuver was performed on the patient and turned out to be negative. Positive Neer and Hawkins tests, both of which positive for supraspinatus tendon impingement, localized shoulder as the cause of patientâ€™s complaint along with finding of supraspinatus tendinopathy on his shoulder MRI. However, as patientâ€™s MRI remains controversial for tendinopathy vs tear, no surgical intervention is indicated at this time.
