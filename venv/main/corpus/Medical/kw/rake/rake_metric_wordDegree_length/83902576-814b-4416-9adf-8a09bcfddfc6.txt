CXR 1Nov2005
    FINDINGS:  There is adequate inflation bilaterally.  No mass, effusion or 	
    pneumothorax is visualized.  Tortuosity of the aorta and degenerative changes of	
    the thoracic spine once again noted.  Cardiac silhouette is normal in size and 	
    contour.  No pulmonary vascular congestion. 	
    	
    IMPRESSION: 	
    	
    1.  No acute cardiopulmonary disease. 	
    	
    2.  Senescent changes of the aorta and thoracic spine.

CXR 20Nov2008
FINDINGS: There has been interval development of diffuse interstitial lung 	
    markings bilaterally predominantly upper lobes.  A reticular nodular component 	
    is suspected.  No focal masses are identified.  There is no evidence of pleural 	
    effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild biapical pleural thickening is seen. 	
    Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits and the osseous structures 	
    are unremarkable. 	
    	
    IMPRESSION:  Interval development of interstitial lung markings predominantly 	
    upper lobes in a reticular nodular pattern.  A CT of the chest is recommended 	
    for further evaluation. 

Chest CT 24Nov2008
FINDINGS: There are multiple micronodules visualized predominantly in the upper 	
    lobes and superior segments of the lower lobes.  The nodules have a 	
    predominantly perilymphatic and subpleural distribution.  There is also upper 	
    lobe peribronchovascular fibrosis and thickening.  Mild bronchiolatelectasis is 	
    present in the upper lobes as well.  Subpleural pseudoplaques are also 	
    visualized predominantly in the left upper lobe. 	
    	
    Several subcentimeter prevascular, AP window, paratracheal, precarinal, and 	
    subcarinal lymph nodes are visualized.  None of the lymph nodes appear to be 	
    calcified. 	
    	
    On the expiratory images, there is minimal air trapping in the lung bases 	
    suggestive of some small airways disease. 	
    	
    In the right lower lobe, there is a subpleural area of increased reticular 	
    markings adjacent to marginal osteophytes along the thoracic spine. 	
    	
    Limited evaluation of the hollow and visceral structures of the upper abdomen is	
    unremarkable. 	
    	
    Multilevel discogenic degenerative changes along the thoracic spine with no 	
    suspicious osteoblastic or osteolytic lesions. 	
    	
    IMPRESSION: Multiple perilymphatic and subpleural nodules primarily in an upper 	
    lobe and perihilar distribution with associated thickening of the 	
    bronchovascular bundles.  Differential considerations include sarcoidosis and 	
    silicosis.  A concomitant superimposed granulomatous infection and lymphangitic 	
    carcinomatosis are also possible but less likely given the fact that the 	
    pulmonary findings are predominantly in an upper lobe  and perilymphatic 	
    distribution.  A pulmonary consult and subsequent follow up CT examinations are 	
    recommended after appropriate therapy is initiated. 	

CXR 15Dec2008
The lungs are adequately inflated.  No pneumothorax.  Stable diffusely increased	
    interstitial lung markings primarily in the upper lobes.  No new airspace 	
    disease.  No pleural effusion.  Normal cardiac silhouette.  Stable senescent 	
    changes of the thoracic aorta.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal. 	
    	
    Stable degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.  Soft tissues are without 	
    abnormality. 	
    	
    Impression: Stable increased lung markings in the upper lobes predominantly with	
    reticulonodular pattern suggestive of sarcoidosis, inflammatory granulomatous, 	
    or infectious granulomatous diseases.
Sarcoidosis
68yo M with history of asbestos exposure presents with 10lb weight loss over 2 mo.  No cough.
