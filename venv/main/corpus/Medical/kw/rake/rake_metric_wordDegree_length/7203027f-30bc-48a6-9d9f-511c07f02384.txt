Afebrile; right flank tenderness, no rebound or guarding, soft abdomen; remainder of exam was unremarkable.
This patient was initially worked up for nephrolithiasis and treated with hydration and pain control.  However a CT scan demonstrated no evidence for calculi or obstruction of the collecting system.  A cystic lesion in the right adnexa was identified on CT and pelvic ultrasound was then ordered.

The patient was taken to surgery and a torsed right paraovarian cyst was identified.  The cyst was removed and the fallopian tube detorsed.  The right ovary appeared grossly unremarkable.
ABD Plain Film: moderate amount of stool

CT: No evidence for calculus in the kidneys/ureters and no obstruction of the collecting system.  Right adnexal region demonstrates cystic lesion with small amount of free fluid.

Pelvic Ultrasound: Flow to normal appearing right and left ovaries. Approximately 4.5 cm cystic lesion adjacent to the right ovary.

15 year old girl with acute onset of severe and intense abdominal pain that doubled her over.
Paraovarian cysts account for 10-20% of all adnexal masses and are relatively uncommon in children.  They are more common in women 30 to 40 years of age. They arise from the tissues of the broad ligament, predominantly from mesothelium covering the peritoneum but also from paramesonephric and rarely mesonephric remnants. The paramesonephric duct (Mullerian duct) forms the fallopian tube at about 9 weeks of gestation. Multiple invaginations near the ostium of the tube become the fimbriae. Any secondary invagination that does not connect may form a blind sac and enlarge to form a paraovanan cyst. Commonly these are referred to as hydatid cysts of Morgagni, Wolffian cysts, Kobelt cysts, and cysts of the organ of Rosenmuller. 

They are usually incidentally discovered during surgery and prophylactic excision is performed due to the increased incidence of torsion as well as their propensity to undergo rapid enlargement.

Complications of paraovarian cysts include torsion in 2-16%, hemorrhage, rupture, secondary infection, and neoplasatic transformation in 2.9% (including papillary serous cystadenoma, endometrioid cystadenocarcinoma, serous cystadenocarcinoma, mucinous cystadenocarcinoma).

Torsion of the paraovarian cyst is three times more common in pregnant women likely related to rapid growth spurt. 

Sonographically, these are thin-walled, smoothly marginated, unilocular cysts.  The may rapidly reach a large size. These cysts do not regress over time, so surgical removal is usually indicated immediately.  The key is to differentiate this cyst from a simple exophytic ovarian cyst which is often observed for regression.   

Case studies emphasize the importance of identifying a separate normal ipsilateral ovary. Ovarian edema and cul-de-sac fluid may be seen with torsion of a parovarian cyst.

Clinically it is difficult to distinguish an ovarian cyst from one arising in the paraovarium. Clinical symptoms are usually secondary to displacement of pelvic organs due to expansive growth of the cyst. 

The hallmark presentation is pain (acute sharp pain, intermittent or gradually increasing lower abdomenal pain). Other symptoms include increasing abdominal girth, menstrual irregularities, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting.  Paraovarian cyst usually become symptomatic when they become >5 cm.

This the second most common type of cyst to cause torsion. (Serous cysts are the most common). The adnexa in the young age group is especially mobile, allowing torsion at the mesosalpinx with changes in patient position or intra-abdominal pressure. Adnexal masses/cysts may act as fulcrum to potentiate torsion of the ovary and tube. Torsion of the fallopian tube and ovary together occurs more often than that of either structure alone. The right side is reported to be more commonly involved â€“ due to decreased space on the left side of the lower abdomen and pelvis (sigmoid mesentery).
