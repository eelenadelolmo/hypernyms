Afebrile. Left eye has periorbital swelling with palpable mass on medial canthus. No discharge.
Due to significant swelling around the eye, treatment for this patient included IV and topical antibiotics, probing, drainage and surgical marsupialization under general anesthesia.
A cystic mass  located anteromedial to left globe
Dacryocystocele with dacryocystitis and periorbital cellulitis
•	Dacryocystocele with or without dacryocystitis 
•	Periorbital cellulitis 
•	Orbital cellulitis 
•	Meningocele 
•	Encephalomeningocele 
•	Hemangioma 
•	Dermoid cyst

A 4 month-old boy presents with left eye swelling for about 48hours that started with dark discoloration on left lower lid. No history of trauma.
A dacryocystocele is a grey-blue cystic swelling often filled with mucoid material below the medial canthus.  It is a rare complication of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. It often results from incomplete canalization of the lower part of the nasolacrimal duct at the valve of Hasner (anatomical) and secondary obstruction proximally at the Rosenmuller valve from distension of the sac and compression of the canal system (functional).
     Incidence of imperforate NLD in full-term fetuses is 35-73% with spontaneous resolution in about 85-95% of patients by age 1.  It is more common in females and often presents unilaterally.  Complications include dacryocystitis, cellulitis, astigmatism, narrowing of lid fissure and respiratory difficulty from mass effect.
