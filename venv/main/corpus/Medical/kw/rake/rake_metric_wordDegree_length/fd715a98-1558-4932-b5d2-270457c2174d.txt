This man has a long history of sialolithiasis treated with sialendoscopy in July of 2014. In September of 2014, after his initial surgical aftercare in clinic, purulent discharge and debris was expressed from the duct in clinic.  The patient was informed that the laser was only able to partially destroy it and since there was a remaining nidus for crystallization, the stone would likely regrow and may become obstructive again. At the time, the patient was counseled patient that it would be best to attempt to surgically remove the entire stone before his symptoms recurred. He endorsed a persistence of the mass below his right mandible, but otherwise denied any swelling in his cheek, expression of pus of debris, pain, warmth or fevers. In June of 2015, the patient presented with a firm submandibular mass and clinical exam was consistent with persistence of a sialolith within the right submandibular gland. The patient underwent resection of the right submandibular gland in August of 2015.
Right submandibular 6 mm obstructing sialolith at the anteromedial margin of the salivary gland. Associated dilation of short segment of duct proximal to this sialolith. No significant sialoadenitis.

35 y.o. man presents with firm mass in right submandibular region and reports foul smelling discharge from mouth.  He has some foul-tasting and discolored drainage from his mouth. His right SMG is firm. No swelling of gland recently. Afebrile. No dyspahgia or odynophagia. No voice changes. No paresthesias of face, lips or tongue. PMH significant for OSA, but otherwise non-contributory.
Sialolithiasis is the most common pathology of all major salivary glands. The submandibular gland is most commonly affected, which is believed to be due to the increased viscosity of its secretions 1.  The patient typically presents with recurrent swelling and pain arising from the involved gland, which is temporal and usually in association with meals due to the obstructive flow of saliva.  Consequently, the portion of the duct proximal to the obstruction is at an increased risk for infection (bacterial sialoadenitis). The first line of treatment is conservative management, utilizing the use of heat and NSAIDs.  Salivation triggers such as sour food items may cause spontaneous expulsion of the sialolith by increasing salivation.  However, if sialolithiasis persists, surgery is the ultimate curative treatment, especially if the stone is located within the parenchyma of the salivary gland and/or if the gland has been scarred from previous non-surgical options such as sialolithotripsy 2.
