Obese male.
None
A diverticulum within the second part of the duodenum was incidently discovered during the barium upper GI series.
Duodenal Diverticulum
false (secondary) diverticula secondary to chronic duodenal ulceration.

Ulceration secondary to primary adenocarcinoma or metastasis

Ulceration secondary to Stronglyloidiasis
48 yo obese male present to flouroscopy for preoperative screening for pending gastric reduction procedure.  He report longstanding gastro esophageal reflux without excessive abdominal pain.  He has no history of gastric surgery.
95% of duodenal diverticulum are located in the second part of the duodenum.

The majority are asymptomatic. They can complicate endoscopic examinations and their location should be described to warn an endoscopist. 

They are distinguished from ulcers by gastric folds entering the diverticulum.

Complications include obstruction or delayed emptying, perforation, hemorrhage, extrinsic pressure in common bile duct or pancreatic duct.
