Patient received an EGD which demonstrated a large, fungating mass in the lower third of the esophagus. The mass was partially obstructing and circumferential involving two thirds of the lumen. This mass appeared to extend to the gastric cardia. Multiple biopsies were obtained. 
A malignant esophageal tumor was suspected and patient subsequently received an IV-contrast enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to evaluate for any metastatic disease. A PET scan obtained after the CT test did not show evidence of lymphatic or hematogenous metastases
IV contrast CT of chest, abd, pelvis:
A 6.1x4.5cm mass that extended into the proximal portion of the stomach was noted at the gatroesophageal junction. There does not appear to be any obstruction of fluids as contrast has advanced through the lesion and into the distal bowel. 
There is a 1.9cm rounded lesion near the tail of the pancreas and a 1.0cm enlarged lymph node adjacent to the portal vein that is concerning for metastatic disease and  should be further evaluated by a PET scan. 
There are multiple hypodensities in the liver and left kidney that are too small to characterize but should be further evaluated.

Esophageal cancer is the 10th leading cause of deaths due to cancer in the United States and continues to be the 19th among cancers in incidence. The two main types are squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Although squamous cell constitutes 95% of esophageal cancers worldwide, adenocarcinoma has steadily increased to be the major histological type in the US since the 1970s.

Adenocarcinoma affects white males in the 6th or 7th decade and is most commonly located in the distal esophagus.  Risk factors include gastroesophageal reflux disease and Barrett’s esophagus where there is replacement of normal squamous lining with intestinal-type columnar epithelium.  Interestingly, these histological changes were found in patients without reflux symptoms. In a Swedish population-based study, 40% of patients with cancer did not have symptoms at least weekly.  In comparison, squamous cell cancer of esophagus is located in proximal-mid esophagus, affects black males, and is commonly associated with tobacco and alcohol consumption. 

Common presenting symptoms of esophageal cancer are dysphagia, weight loss, GERD odynophagia, and dyspnea. These symptoms, especially any evidence of mechanical obstruction, should prompt an upper endoscopy where biopsies can be obtained. The primary tumor can then be imaged suing CT and endoscopic ultrasound. CT provides a general overview of the cancer and demonstrates adjacent organ involvement, although esophageal wall layers are not easily distinguished. EUS is gaining popularity due to its strength in visualizing the wall layers. Its drawbacks include operator skill and viewing “hard to reach” tumors. 

Once the diagnosis of the tumor is made, imaging to rule out metastatic disease should be performed. Intravenous-contrast enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis remains the gold standard although sensitivity is dependent on the size of the lesion. MRI and US modalities can be used to further characterize metastatic lesions. Positron Emission Tomography is a new tool that visualizes the higher rate of glucose uptake by malignant tissue versus normal, thus, providing more information about metastatic disease. 

Appropriate imaging allows clinicians to properly stage the tumor, which directly affects the treatment options and prognosis. Well localized tumors can be resected and have the best 5-year survival of 65-85%. More invasive tumors and those with distant metastses are not surgical candidates and are treated with combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy for palliation. The overall 5yr survival of esophageal cancer is 12-15%.
