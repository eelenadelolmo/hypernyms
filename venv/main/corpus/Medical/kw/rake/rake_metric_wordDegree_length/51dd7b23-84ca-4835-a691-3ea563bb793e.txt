â€¢ Blood pressure in right arm 140/90 and in right leg 118/66.  
â€¢ HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, no scleral icterus
â€¢ Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 physiologic splitting, no S3 or S4.  Murmur auscultated at anterior chest which is moderately harsh, low-pitched, grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur that is best heard at the left upper sternal boarder.  From the posterior, the murmur is more distinct and clear at the left parasternal area.
â€¢ Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes, rhonchi, rales
â€¢ Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, normal auscultation
â€¢ Extremities: No clubbing or edema noted

PMH:  Nephrology evaluation heard a systolic murmur.  No murmur had ever been mentioned to the patientâ€™s mother in the past.  She never had any cardiovascular symptoms during feeding as an infant; such as sweating, dyspnea, irritability, cyanosis, frequent pauses, etc.  Her growth and development have been normal.  She is active without cardiovascular symptoms during exercise.
â€¢ Echocadiogram showed possible coarctation of the aorta and a cardiac gated CT was ordered for better demonstration of the anomaly.
The patient will undergo an interventional catheterization procedure for repair
The thoracic aorta is notable for high-grade coarctation with post-stenotic dilatation.  The level of the stenosis is 2.5 cm distal to the take off of an otherwise enlarged left subclavian artery.  Multiple enlarged collateral vessels are identified, including bilateral internal mammary, intercostal, and subphrenic arteries.  The branch vessels are all patent.
Coarctation of the Aorta
â€¢Aortic dissection
â€¢Coarctation of the aorta
â€¢Focal vasculitis
â€¢Extrinsic mass pressing on the aorta
11 y.o. girl with systemic hypertension and a murmur.
â€¢              The typical location for coarctation of the aorta is just distal to the left subclavian artery, which is the location of the patient's lesion in this case.
â€¢              Though not a functional study, this patient is suspected to have a bicuspid aortic valve from this imaging.  Bicuspid aortic valve is frequently associated with coarctation of the aorta (reported incidence of 30 to 40 percent).
â€¢              The stenotic area of the proximal aorta had an area of 0.17 cm^2 while the proximal descending aorta 1 cm below the stenosis had an area of 2.65 cm^2
â€¢	Coarctation of the aorta is a common malformation accounting for six to eight percent of all congenital heart defects. 
â€¢	Girls with Turner syndrome are at increased risk with a prevalence rate of greater than 10 percent. 
â€¢	The classical clinical manifestations are hypertension in the upper extremities, diminished and/or delayed femoral pulses, and low or unattainable arterial blood pressure in the lower extremities. 
â€¢	Clinical presentation varies in different age groups. Neonates may be asymptomatic if there is a PDA or if the coarctation is not severe. Neonates with severe disease may present in heart failure and/or shock. Older infants and children may be asymptomatic or present (especially with exertion) with chest pain, cold extremities, and claudication. Adults will present with hypertension and if the coarctation is severe may have headaches, epistaxis, heart failure or aortic rupture or dissection.
â€¢	Chest radiographic findings vary with age and severity of the coarctation. In infants with heart failure, the chest radiograph usually shows generalized cardiomegaly with increased pulmonary vascular markings due to pulmonary venous congestion. In older children and adults, the heart size may remain normal but other findings include rib notching and the 3 sign (indentation of the aortic wall at the site of coarctation with pre and post-coarctation dilatation). 
â€¢	Two-dimensional and Doppler transthoracic echocardiography is indicated for initial evaluation to establish the diagnosis and detect associated cardiac defects. 
â€¢	MR or CT angiography is indicated to define the location of the obstruction and identify collateral vessels. 
â€¢	Echocardiography or MRI are also useful for post-repair follow-up. CT may be helpful if MRI is contraindicated.
