Texto: 
H.pylori negative; poorly controlled diabetes.
Images from a Tc99m-sulfur colloid gastric emptying study show visually delayed gastric emptying as well as delayed clearance of radiotracer from the stomach when compared to an established nomogram.
Delayed Gastric Emptying, likely secondary to diabetic gastroparesis.
Delayed gastric emptying of acute onset: pain, cold, medications, ileus, viral gastroenteritis, and metabolic derangements such as hyperglycemia and hypokalemia.  

Chronic causes of delayed gastric emptying: gastric outlet obstruction, postvagotomy state, gastric ulcer, chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudoobstruction, gastroesophageal reflux, diabetes mellitus, amyloidosis, and uremia, to name a few
The patient is a 56 year-old diabetic woman with a long-standing history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, now presenting with symptoms of bloating.
