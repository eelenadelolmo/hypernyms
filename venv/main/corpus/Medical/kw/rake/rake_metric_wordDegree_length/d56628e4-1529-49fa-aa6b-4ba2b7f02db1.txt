The patient was intubated and subsequently underwent tracheostomy.  She is currently still in the intensive care unit, day 20.
Diffuse, bilateral, hazy airspace opacities predominately in the mid to low lung zones.  Overall, these findings are nonspecific, but with known history of pulmonary hemorrhage after bronchoscopy or clinical findings of hemoptysis and anemia, these findings are consistent with diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage.
