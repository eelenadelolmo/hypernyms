No abnormal findings
Resection and re-imaging to insure no recurrence or residual tumor
6 cm extra axial left parietal mass with vasogenic edema
Meningioma
â€¢ meninigioma if extra-axial
â€¢ astrocytoma, oligo-dendroglioma if intra-axial
26 y.o. man complains of headache
This extra axial mass demonstrates a large number of arterial feeders, typical for meningioma.

Angiographically, a large stain of contrast is seen with a central focus.  This capillary tumor blush arrives early in the arterial phase and stays late into the venous phase.  Previously coined the "mother-in-law" phenomenon, since it comes early, stays late, and usually is very dense.
