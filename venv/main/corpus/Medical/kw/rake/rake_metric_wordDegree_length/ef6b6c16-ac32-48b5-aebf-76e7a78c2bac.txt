Neurologic exam shows spasticity, very brisk reflexes, and up-going toes.  An MRI examination of the brain was ordered, to include a T2* image sequence.
• Abnormal T2 hypointensity in the globus pallidus
• Abnormal T2 hyperintensity in the center creating an "eye of the tiger" sign appearance
PANK 2 (Hallervorden-Spatz) PKAN (Pantothenate Kinase Associated Neurodegeneration)
• NBIA 1 - PKAN ("Hallervorden-Spatz" w/PANK2)
• NBIA 1 - PKAN ("Hallervorden-Spatz" w/o PANK2)
• NBIA 2 - Ferritin light-chain disease
• INAD- infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy
• Aceruloplasminemia
5 y.o. girl with a history of gait problems presents with progressive dystonia and dysarthria, mild rigidity, and choreoathetosis.  No Hx of seizures, infection, etc.
We made up this history, based on the typical and common features of the PANK2 mutation positive or PKAN neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation - NBIA type 1 disease - formerly known as Hallervorden-Spatz disease.  The specific mutation (PANK2) is strongly linked to the specific MR appearance of the "eye of the tiger".
