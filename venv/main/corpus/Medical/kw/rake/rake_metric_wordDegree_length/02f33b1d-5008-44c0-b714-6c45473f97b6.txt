Amniocentesis was declined by the patient.
At birth (c-section at 34 weeks for premature rupture of membranes) a midline defect was found with malrotated extracorporeal small bowel, large bowel, liver, spleen, and gastrum contained within a partially ruptured membrane.  The umbilical cord inserted into the membrane.  The testes were undescended.  No other congenital defects were detected.
The defect was initially wrapped in a warm saline soaked gauze.  Upon transfer to the NICU the entire defect was placed in a silastic silo with an attempt to return the bowel to the abdominal cavity over the next 7-10 days.
