Routine annual mammogram
Architectural distortion in the right upper outer breast with associated calcifications
Fibrocystic change with adenosis
-Infiltrating carcinoma
-Complex sclerosing lesion (radial scar)
-Fibrocystic change with sclerosing adenosis

-Post-surgical or traumatic scar  (patient had no prior history of surgery or trauma to right breast)
38 y/o woman for screening mammogram.
A free-hand (anteroposterior) needle/wire location was used in this case.  This is a more difficult technique that requires extrapolation of the lesion from a compressed mammogram to the breast in a natural, uncompressed state.   

Some suggest increase risk of complications such as chest wall penetration (pneumothorax) with this technique (versus parallel to chest wall approach).  This approach may also need several adjustments to get the needle/wire within 1 cm of the lesion
