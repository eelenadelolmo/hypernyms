Inability to abduct the arm
MRI demonstrated advanced osteoarthritis with  large humeral head osteophytes . A large  lateral osteophyte causes impingement on  of the infraspinatus tendon  .
MRI also shows an almost full-thickness tear of supraspinatus tendon and impingement of the tendon by the acromioclaviular arthrosis and the coracoid procces.
Impingement of the rotator cuff  , full-thickness tear of supraspinatus tendon
Pain in shoulder
MRI is used to determine the bone abnormalities causing impingement sush us acromial shape, including the lateral tilt of the acromion. 
In addition, MRI can show the presence of rotator cuff  and subacromial bursa abnormalities, degeneration of the acromioclavicular joint, and evidence of glenohumeral instability. Although this anatomic information is essential for evaluation of the patient, it does not provide information about the functional kinematics of the shoulder.
