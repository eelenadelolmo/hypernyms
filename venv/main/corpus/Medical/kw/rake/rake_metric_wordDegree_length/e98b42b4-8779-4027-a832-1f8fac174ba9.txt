Texto: 
The patient was admitted to the hospital, where she initially received serial head CT's to monitor for progression/evolution of her hemorrhage (there was no progression).  She subsequently received an MRI/MRA of the brain (normal MRA), followed by a carotid ultrasound.  The ultrasound revealed atherosclerotic plaque without hemodynamically significant stenosis.

Approximately three weeks after admission the patient was discharged with some persistent weakness and scheduled for outpatient rehabilitation therapy.
• Acute CT (obtained within hours of symptom onset):  Hyperattenuating lesion in right putamen with surrounding hypodensity consistent with edema.  Mass effect on the adjacent lateral ventricle and effacement of the nearby sulci is noted.

• Followup MRI (obtained 6 days after symptom onset):  Right putamen lesion with a rim of T1 bright, T2 dark signal intensity.  Surrounding T2 bright signal consistent with edema.  No enhancement (compare pre- and post-Gd images).
Hypertensive Basal Ganglia Hemorrhage
Hemorrhagic lesion in putamen – differential includes:
• hypertensive hemorrhage
• hemorrhage from a vascular malformation
• hemorrhage from a neoplasm (primary or metastatic)
81 y.o. woman presents to the emergency department with left sided weakness and a systolic blood pressure of 200mm Hg.
The T1-bright, T2-dark rim classifies the stroke in the early subacute phase of hemoglobin breakdown (within 3 to 7 days). This is consistent with the fact that the MRI was obtained 6 days after the ictus.
