Abdominal distention
Therapeutic gastrografin enema.  Infant began passing normal appearing meconium while in the fluoroscopy suite.  No further treatment indicated.
Supine radiograph of the chest and abdomen demonstrates numerous dilated air-filled loops of bowel.
Enema with dilute gastrograffin demonstrates long segment filling defect within the descending and sigmoid colon and rectum and subtle transition zone between this narrower segment and the more proximal colon.
