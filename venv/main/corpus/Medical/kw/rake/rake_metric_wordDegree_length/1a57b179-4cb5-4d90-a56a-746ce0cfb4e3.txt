60 year old man in automobile accident.  The car was found in a creek, overturned, lying on its roof.  The patient was not breathing and the seatbelt was impinging on his neck.  CPR was started and patient was brought to ER.
After a single vehicle event, this man was partially submerged for an unknown period of time. There were no signs of drowning nor aspiration of water. The dramatic findings suggest that the hypoxia lasted for some time before imaging. Hypoperfusion usually has initial effects in the border-zones between vascular territories. Hypoxia/anoxia tends to affect areas of higher metabolism (cortical and deep gray matter). In adult patients, the earliest changes (24 hrs) show increased signal on FLAIR and DWI in the basal ganglia, cortex (occipital and peri-rolandic), and thalami. In the very early cases, CT and T2 changes may be subtle.
