Pre-operative chemotherapy
Multiple nephrogenic rests, variable in size, in bilateral kidneys with characteristic homogeneous, hypodensity after contrast administration.
The predominant mass however involving the upper pole of the left kidney demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement consistent with a Wilm's Tumor.
Also on the third image, there is an enhancing para-aortic mass that likely represents metastatic lymphadenopathy.
Nephroblastomatosis
Nephroblastomatosis
Renal Lymphoma
15 month old boy presented to a clinic in Germany with an abdominal mass.  Ultrasound images reportedly demonstrated a possible left adrenal mass.  Patient and family was then air-evacuated to Walter Reed Army Medical Center for further evaluation.
This case represents the more common type of Nephroblastomatosis, with multifocal nephrogenic rests. Please see Factoid for detailed discussion of this entity.
