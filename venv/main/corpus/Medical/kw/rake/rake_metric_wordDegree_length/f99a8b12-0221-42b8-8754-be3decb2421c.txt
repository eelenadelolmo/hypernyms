Texto: 
No signs/symptoms of trauma or physical deformity on exam.  Auscultation revealed decreaed breath sounds on the right with dullness to percussion.  Labs were all within normal limits.
The exact cause for this case is uncertain (no evidence of TB, prior pleural hemorrhage, no underlying lung disease).
Chest x-ray demonstrated volume loss on the right in association with diffuse pleural thickening.  Similar findings noted on CT, but there is extension of the process into the chest wall as noted by asymmetric chest wall tissues (thicker on right).  No calcification associated with areas of pleural thickening found with either imaging mode.
Unilateral Fibrothorax
- Primary malignancy (mesothelioma)
- Metastatic disease (spread of thymoma or lung adenocarcinoma)
- Hemothorax
- Prior empyema or exudative effusion (esp. asbestos exposure)
- Pleural fibrosis (fibrothorax)
- Multi-loculated pleural effusion/empyema
54 year-old woman with right-sided chest pain
Diffuse pleural thickening is typically the result of underlying / untreated disease.  In particular, unilateral involvement is suggestive of malignancy.  However, biopsy with subsequent histology showed no evidence of metastatic disease or mesothelioma.
