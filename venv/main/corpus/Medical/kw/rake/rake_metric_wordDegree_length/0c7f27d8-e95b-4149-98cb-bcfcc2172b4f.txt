20 y.o. active duty male with subdural hematoma, intubated.
There is volume loss which is essential for the diagnosis of atelectasis.  A consolidative process such as pneumonia maintains its lung volume.  The collapsed lung does not obscure the right heart border and therefore cannot be the right middle lobe.
