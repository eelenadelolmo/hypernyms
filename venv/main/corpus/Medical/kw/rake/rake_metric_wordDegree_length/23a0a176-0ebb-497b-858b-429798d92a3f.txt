Texto: 
Mild wheezes bilaterally in upper lung fields, otherwise unremarkable with normal respirator effort. Sputum, blood cultures were negative. TB testing negative x 2.
2 week follow up with HRCT before then to further evaluate. No further treatment as patient has completed antibiotic course, lesions were determined to be cystic and is asymptomatic.
Residual pneumonic process. LUL w/ multiple cavitations. 
Homogenous mass 3.5cm x 4.0cm along mid left lateral chest wall. 
Single cavitation 4cm in diameter present in RUL. 
No pleural effusion. Normal heart size.
Post inflammatory cystic changes secondary to severe community acquired pneumonia.
Cystic vs. granulomatous lesions.

Cystic: Blebs, Bullae, Congenital cystic lesions, Coccidomycosis, PCP, Hydadid, Traumatic Cysts.

Cavitary: Neoplastic, Staph, GNR, Mycobacteria, Anerobes, Coccy, Histo, PCP, Aspergillosis, Parasites, Immunologic, Emboli, PMF, Bronchiectasis, Congenital Lesions
18 yo 6 weeks s/p acute episode of severe community acquired pneumonia treated with full course of antibiotics. Patient reported improved symptoms at time of study.
2 week follow up with HRCT before then to further evaluate. No further treatment as patient has completed antibiotic course, lesions were determined to be cystic and is asymptomatic.
