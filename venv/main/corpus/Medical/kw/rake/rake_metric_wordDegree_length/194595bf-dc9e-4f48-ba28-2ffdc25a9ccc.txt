Neuro exam: horizontal nystagmus present bilaterally at the extremes of the EOM range.  The patient had symmetric facial motor movement and tongue was midline, with no fasciculations noted.  The patient reported decreased facial sensation on the right side of the face in all three distributions when compared to the left.  The rest of the physical exam was non-contributory.  An audiology screening showed unilateral right-sided hearing loss.
Neurosurgery was performed to remove the tumor. Intraoperative evoked potentials were used to monitor cranial nerves during the procedure. Gross total resection was achieved.  There were no intraoperative complications.   Post-op follow up demonstrated right sided hearing loss that recovered.  Infrequent headaches were also reported.  Additional cranial nerve deficits were observed, including decreased right facial sensation, right facial weakness, left palatal deviation and swallowing difficulty and myopia.  In addition, the patient noted speech delay and voice changes.  Post serial imaging showed a small residual tumor measuring 1.4 cm x 1.4 cm x 1.4 cm.  The patient continues to be followed by Neuro/Onc and has been referred to a genetic counselor to assess for Neurfibromatosis 2.
A large, solid, enhancing mass is present at the right
cerebellopontine angle.  Prior to IV contrast, the mass is slightly lower T1 signal than adjacent brain stem and cerebellum.  After IV contrast, the mass enhances fairly homogeneously with scattered areas of low signal intensity and no enhancement within the mass.  The mass has a dumbbell shape extending into the superior anterior aspect of the right jugular foramen. The right internal jugular vein is compressed but not occluded. The mass does not extend into the porus acusticus.  The mass does not extend as high as the tentorium and does not extend into the foramen magnum.  The overall maximum size estimate is 4.3 cm AP x 3.5 cm transverse x 4.1 cm vertical.  The basilar artery is anterior to the mass with CSF between the mass and basilar artery. The right vertebral artery is anterior to the mass.  No definite dural tail is seen.  Mass effect is present on the right side of the pons, right middle cerebellar peduncle, and right cerebellar hemisphere.  The fourth ventricle is distorted.  On the T2 weighted images, no abnormal signal intensity is present within the adjacent cerebellum or brainstem.  The third and fourth ventricles are normal in  size.  No other area of abnormal enhancement is seen.
Vestibular Schwannoma
nerve sheath tumor, meningioma, ependymoma, Neurofibromatosis type II
A 16-year-old male presented to his primary care physician with a two-month history of sudden, unilateral, right-sided hearing loss that was accompanied by minimal decreased sensation on the right side of his face.  An audiology screening showed unilateral right-sided hearing loss.
