Apgar scores were 7 and 9.
The only significant finding on physical exam was hypoactive bowel sounds. The abdomen was soft and mildly-distended. All other systems were normal on exam. 
From 2/19/2008 (day of life 1)CBC:  WBC 11, Hgb 16, Hct 45.9, plts 144  MCV 120 BMP: NA 129 K 5.8 Cl 97 HCO3 23.5 BUN 8 Cr 0.9 Glucose 123 Ca 8.1
â€¢ Initial portable abdominal film: There is air identified in the stomach and in the proximal portion of the duodenum. There is no air seen distally. Impression: Suspicious for proximal obstruction or malrotation.

â€¢ Upper GI small bowel follow through: The scout film demonstrates air in the stomach and proximal duodenum. There is no organomegaly, mass, or mass effect.   There is prompt flow of contrast material into the stomach. Morphology of the stomach is normal.  There is prompt flow of contrast material out of the stomach and into the proximal portion of the duodenum.  The duodenal c-loop is in normal position. The proximal duodenum is quite distended and despite multiple attempts at positioning I could not pass contrast beyond the third portion of the duodenum.   Impression:  Imaging thus far demonstrates obstruction at the distal end of the duodenum without evidence of malrotation at this time. Interval plain films will be obtained to confirm this suspicion.

â€¢ Interval plain films: Two supine portable films of the abdomen are submitted. The first was performed at midnight. The second was performed at 6:00 a.m. The film performed at midnight demonstrates residual contrast and air in the stomach and proximal duodenum. The duodenum appears to fill to the third portion.   There is no air or contrast distally. The distal end of the duodenum has a bulbous appearance. On the 6:00 a.m. film there is no residual contrast in the stomach or duodenum. There is no air distal in the small bowel or colon.

This is a day 0 newborn baby boy.  Mom is 19yo P1G0 at 36 weeks gestation. The pregnancy was complicated by an antenatal ultrasound that revealed dilated loops of bowel, thickened bowel loop walls and polyhydramnios. The mother had spontaneous rupture of membranes followed by 3 doses of antibiotics and subsequent Cesarean delivery. During delivery it was noted that there was a large amount of amniotic fluid containing flecks of debris.  Additionally, the baby's stomach was suctioned of 250ccâ€™s of bilious amniotic fluid.
Clinical decision making: A 0 day old infant with abdominal distention, bilious emesis, dilated proximal small bowel and stomach on x-ray and an upper GI series with small bowel follow-through that showed no passage of contrast distal to the third portion of the duodenum is a surgical patient no matter the ultimate diagnosis. 
 
Treatment: This patient was taken to the operating room and underwent exploratory laparotomy. Ultimately, 95% of the patientâ€™s jejunum and ileum were resected leaving 2-3cm distal to the ligament of Treitz and 2-3cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. A jejunostomy was created at that time with the remaining proximal small bowel. 

Operative report findings:  The findings for this case were; meconium peritonitis, very large amount of dead bowel, small bowel perforation. After the procedure, the remaining portion of the bowel included 2-3cm distal to the ligament of Treitz and 2-3cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. 

Follow-up:  This patient remained NPO on TPN for 10 days after surgery. Tube feeds were then advanced as tolerated and TPN decreased accordingly. Short gut was diagnosed and GI as well as nutrition were consulted. Additionally, Pulmonology was consulted for possible CF due to the meconium peritonitis. Patient did well postoperatively. G-tube and central line catheter were placed 30 days post op. The jejunostomy was taken down and an ileojejunostomy performed 49 days after the patientâ€™s initial surgery. In the long term this patient will need a bowel transplant.
