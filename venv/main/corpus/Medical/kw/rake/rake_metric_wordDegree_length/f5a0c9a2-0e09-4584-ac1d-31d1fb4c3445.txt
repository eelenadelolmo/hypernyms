Grulich and Pyle bone age calculated at 11y 6/12 months (nl is 12 y 8 months =/- 20 months.   This is between 1 and 2 standard deviations below normal,  
GH Stim test showed GH baseline, peak GH, IGF and IGF binding protein normal for age.
Growth Hormone injections were started and on follow up four months later pt gained 2.2kg and 1.9cm.  Current treatment involves daily growth hormone injections into adulthood.  The benefits of continued injection through adulthood are controversial.
Non-contrast MR imaging of the brain did not show expected high T2 signal posterior pituitary in the sella, but did show high T1 signal in the region of the pituitary stalk.  Post contrast images demonstrated a small enhancing mass in the region of the pituitary stalk.  The anterior pituitary enhanced with contrast and was found in it's normal anatomical position.
Ectopic Posterior Pituitary
Suprasellar masses:
craniopharyngioma, Rathke cleft cyst, hemorrhage, dermoid & lipoma, ectopic posterior pituitary

In conjunction with an abnormal empty sella turcica, bright suprasellar lesion on T1 MR, and clinical history of growth deficiency the diagnosis is ectopic posterior pituitary until proven otherwise.
12y 8m old boy presents with short stature.  Pt was a gestational twin and born at 27 wks. via C-section.  Pregnancy was complicated by incompetent cervix and PPROM.  Pt's birth weight was 1070 gm and Apgars were 6,8 and 0 at 1,5 and 10 minutes respectively.  Pt's neonatal course was complicated requiring ventilator dependency for 1 month, phototherapy for jaundice and tracheostomy for subglottic stenosis.  Since birth pt has been well below the 5th percentile for weight and height but growth has paralleled the growth curve.  Pt's mother is 5'1", father is 5'11” and family hx is unremarkable for short stature.
The pituitary gland is divided into two tightly apposed but structurally distinct lobes located in the sella turcica, a saddle shaped depression in the sphenoid bone.  Each lobe has separate embryological origins but the development and differentiation of the two are dependent on each other for complex cell-to-cell signaling. Development of the pituitary usually starts weeks 4-5 of gestation and by the 20th week of development is mature.

The adenohypophysis is formed from the ectodermal cells of the oropharynx that evaginate upward towards the ventral diencephalon to form Rathke’s pouch.  The pouch eventually pinches off leaving behind a small cleft that structurally separates the two lobes even into adulthood.  The upper portion of the pouch surrounds the neural stalk and forms the pars tuberalis and pars intermedia.  


The neurohypophysis forms from an evagination of ectodermal tissue from the diencephalon.  The walls of the pouch eventually fuse to form the neural stalk, while the upper portion of the pouch becomes the median eminence.  Releasing hormones produced in the hypothalamus are transported by hypothalamic axons that run through the stalk to the anterior pituitary.  The axons also transport oxytocin and vasopressin, hormones stored and released by the neurohypophysis.  


Ectopic Posterior Pituitary:

Ectopic posterior pituitary is a congenital anomaly involving a defect in the normal migration of cells from the neural tube. It is often found in children with growth hormone deficiencies for reasons not well understood.  Radiographic findings of an absent posterior pituitary in the sella turcica and a bright suprasellar lesion on T1W1 are consistent with the diagnosis.  Studies have also shown that children with empty sella often have endocrine dysfunction with growth hormone deficiency being the most common. 


Lipomas and Dermoid cysts do appear bright on T1W1 but appear hypodense when a fat suppression pulse is applied.  

Findings of an empty sella in children warrant an investigations for other conditions.  If the clinical and laboratory picture were one of panhypopituitarism than primary adenohypophysis hypoplasia would be a likely diagnosis.  Diabetes insipidus has also been linked to empty sella and would be suspected in a child with polyuria, polydipsia, and hypernatremia.  Complaints of headaches or vision changes necessitate a workup for increased intracranial pressure.


The most common abnormality with ectopic posterior pituitary is growth hormone deficiency.  Treatment is aimed at replacing the hormone deficiency with growth hormone injections until the patient reaches adult bone age.  Continuing injections past adult bone age is controversial.
