Texto: 
Alert and oriented, with a very hypophonic voice with short one word answers.    5/5 strength in all four extremities. Reflexes brisk in biceps, and knees.  Sensation intact throughout.   Finger to nose intact- end point tremor, mild dysmetria, heel to shin with mild dysmetria. Gait with two person assist was unsteady with short shuffling steps, but after a few steps, he remained unsteady but progressed towards a more normal stride.
 
Labs were significant for:
Ceruloplasmin <6 mg/dL
Copper serum low  34 mcg/dL
24 hr urine copper level 182 mcg/day
A liver biopsy showed mild to moderate fibrosis (stage 2). Copper in the liver biopsy paraffin block was high at 350.9 mcg/g. 

The patient was discharged with glycopyrrolate 1mg TID, as needed for drooling. His Wilson's disease was treated with the copper chelator trientine, starting dose of 250 mg BID, and then increased to 500 mg BID. The patient was readmitted to the hospital 2 months after discharge with worsening mental status and muscle spasms. He also had failure to thrive, with oropharyngeal dysphagia, becoming tube feed dependent. His copper serum was low at 17 mcg/dL, and his ceruloplasmin remained low at <6 mg/dL. His trientine dose was decreased, and a trial of zinc was started. No interventions appeared to be helpful in  the improvement of his mental status, and he passed away.
MRI of the brain with and without contrast:
There is abnormal diffusion restriction with associated T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity involving the bilateral thalami with extension into the midbrain and pons as well as the bilateral putamina in a symmetric manner.  Additional diffusion restriction abnormality with associated T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity involves the cortex of the bilateral frontal lobes, left greater than right.  Low gradient signal is seen in the putamina as well. There is no mass effect associated with this abnormal signal. No other abnormal parenchymal signal is identified. Diffuse parenchymal volume loss is also noted.
Hepatolenticular Degeneration, Wilson's disease
• Wilson's disease
• Leigh disease
• Creutzfeldt Jakob disease
• Carbon monoxide poisoning
• Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
• PKAN/NBIA (Hallervorden-Spatz)
This 21 y.o. man presents with several months of progressive apraxia, sialorrhea, decreased appetite, hesitant gait, and recent urinary incontinence.  Previous history of Asperger’s and bipolar affective disorder.
This is a classic clinical presentation of Wilson's disease that included low cerulosplasmin, dysarthria, ataxia, drooling, and urinary incontinence.  An ocular slit-lamp examination was done on this patient, but it was not revealing of Kayser-Fleischer rings.

The classic MRI findings found in this patient include bilateral, symmetric T2WI hyperintensity of the putamina, 'face of a giant panda' in the midbrain, and 'face of a miniature panda' in the pontine tegmentum.  Cortical white matter changes have been previously reported in this disease process as well, which are seen in the bilateral frontal lobes of this patient.
