Texto: 
Diffuse abdominal distention and tenderness to palpation.  Uptrending direct bilirubin.
Gall bladder nearly filled with ecogenic, non-shadowing sludge, thickening gall bladder wall, and trace pericholecystic fluid.
Gall Bladder Wall Thickening
1) Acalculus cholecystitis
2) AIDS cholangiopathy
3) Biliary outflow obstructio
Past medical history significant for HIV and newly diagnosed Hodgkin's Lymphoma with several days of generalized abdominal pain.
This patient had clinical and laboratory evidence of biliary obstruction and on ultrasound had evidence of superimposed acalculus cholecystitis, although a confirmatory HIDA scan was not obtained.  He had notable lymphadenopathy in the right upper quadrant which could have been contributing to some degree of outflow obstruction.  He also had extensive biliary sludging without evidence of actual stones.
