Labs/PE:  Slight antalgic gait on the right.  Muscle strength 5/5 with 2+ deep tendon reflexes bilaterally.  Pulses normal in dorsal pedis, posterior tibial and femoral arteries.

LDH 574 U/L (313-618)

Alpha fetoprotein (3/1/05) 243.1 ng/mL (0.0 – 15.0)  
Alpha fetoprotein (1/7/05) 46.1 ng/mL (0.0 – 15.0)  
Alpha fetoprotein (12/29/04) 38.7 ng/mL (0.0 – 15.0)  

Initial Pathology (percutaneous biopsy):
Bone and soft tissue reaming, right femur:
Devitalized bone, necrotic and viable hematopoietic bone marrow with no evidence of malignancy

Re-biopsy result:
Metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.
Patient underwent ORIF of the right femur by orthopedic surgery.  Following the surgical procedure, the patient proceeded to undergo prophylactic palliative radiation therapy to the left hip, which was followed by palliative radiation therapy to the right humerus and right postoperative hip/femur.The patient tolerated radiation therapy well with amelioration of his right humerus pain by the completion of therapy and decrease in his right hip pain, as well.
AP radiograph of the hips demontrate a poorly defined lucency of the greater trochanter and intertrochanteric region extending into the femoral neck.


CT demonstrates a lytic lesion in the right femoral neck with thinning of the cortex and destruction of the anterior cortex.

MRI demonstrates a 3 cm circumscribed lesion in the anterior right femoral neck.  Low signal on T1 and moderately high on T2 with moderate enhancement with surrounding edema.  A second lesion is at the base of the lesser trochanter measuring 1.8 cm

FDG PET scan demonstrates  focal areas of increased metabolism in the left and right femoral neck.  Focal area of photopenia in the right lobe of the liver is demonstrated compatible with patient's prior chemoembolization of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Focal increased metabolism in the femoral necks extending into the femoral heads.  SUV value in the right femoral head is 2.29 and in the left femoral head of 3.21.
Hepatocellular carcinoma and bone metastasis.
Metastatic disease
Infection
Primary neoplasm
38-year-old Nigerian male was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in July 2004. Thereafter, heunderwent multiple chemoembolizations of liver metastases for his disease, as well as multiple agent narcotic analgesia for pain control. He noted right hip pain and difficulty ambulating for 4 weeks.  Patient just underwent chemoembolization for a lesion in the left lobe of the liver.
In the setting of hepatocellular carcinoma, a lytic lesion must be presumed to be metastatic in nature.  Furthermore, hepatocellular carcinoma must be excluded in a patient with a lytic bone lesion in a patient with a history of cirrhosis.  Risk factors for bone metastasis in this patient included multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma and rising alpha fetoprotein.
