Treatment:   If pericardial effusion is small (0.5-1.0 cm on CT/MRI), follow with serial echocardiograms. If greater than 1.0-2.0 cm and/or if patient is symptomatic, treatment is pericardiocentesis or pericardial window.
A very large pericardial effusion is seen which does not enhance with contrast, and which is hypodense when compared to adjacent heart.  Additionally, there is a left pleural effusion with area of compressive atelectasis in left lower lobe.
Pericardial Effusion
Of pericardial effusion: None.
Of  cardiac tamponade: Constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy.
Patient is a 19 year-old female, 24 weeks pregnant, with history of systemic lupus erythematosus. Pt now presents with pleuritic chest pain. Pt denies SOB.
Excess pericardial fluid may be present in all forms of pericardial disease, including percarditis secondary to SLE and other collagen vascular diseases.

Pericardial effusion in the setting of pericarditis may be found incidentally, as was in this patient, upon imaging studies in patients complaining of pleuritic chest pain.

If the collection of fluid is rapid, a small amount, (100-200 ml of pericardial fluid), can result in cardiac tamponade. Conversely, if accumulation of fluid is more insipid, larger amounts (up to 1500 ml) can accumulate within the pericardium without tamponade physiology.
