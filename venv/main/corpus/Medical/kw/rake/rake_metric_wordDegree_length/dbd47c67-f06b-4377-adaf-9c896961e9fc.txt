Patients should be offered a maternal-fetal medicine consult for further evaluation (ie amniocentesis) to check for chromosomal abnormalities.
2-vessel cord.  A single artery and a single vein are seen.  Normally, in a 3 vessel cord, 2 arteries can be seen splitting around the bladder.  Here, only one is seen, a strong indicator of a 2-vessel cord.
Two Vessel Umbilical Cord
As described in the discussion, if imaged at the placenta, umbilical artery fusion may mimick a 2-vessel cord.  Therefore, a suspected 2-vessel cord should be imaged at the umbilicus.
21 yo G1P0 presents for routine 2nd trimester fetal anatomy scan.
This patient was informed that approximately 30-60% of 2-vessels cords are associated with other abnormalities.  She was referred back to OB/GYN to be offered an MFM consult.
