Coil embolization achieved hemostasis
Digital subtraction angiographic images reveal use of a Renegade catheter to subselect a branch of the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery, with a small focus of extravasation.  This focus of extravasation is also seen with subselection of a second branch of the pancreaticoduodenal artery.  The final image demonstrates multiple coils, with no evidence of extravasation.
Coil embolization of a duodenal bleed
Differential for duodenal bleeding:

ulcer
neoplasm
pancreatitis
aortoenteric fistula
angiodysplasia
Dieulofoy Lesion
63 yo Caucasian man with fulminant hepatic failure due to Augmentin toxicity and developing renal failure.  He presents with recurrent duodenal bleeds s/p upper endoscopy and failed attempts at injection sclerotherapy and electrocautery, with recurrent hematemesis.
More proximal embolization of the GDA or PDA would have allowed bleeding from collateral branches from the SMA. The operator did an excellent job subselecting the most distal branches possible subserving area of bleeding.
