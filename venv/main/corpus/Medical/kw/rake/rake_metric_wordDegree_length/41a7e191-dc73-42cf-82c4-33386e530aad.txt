prolactin 794 ng/mL
The patient was started on bromocriptine.
MRI: There is a 1.6cm cc x 1.4cm transverse x 1.6cm AP expansile mass in the sella turcica.  The mass demonstrates peripheral enhancement, with a central fluid-fluid level best appreciated on the axial T2 sequence.
Prolactinoma
The radiographic examination, laboratory finding, and history are consistent with prolactinoma.
27 yo woman presents for evaluation of her amenorrhea.  She is currently taking no medication.
This patient bled into her tumor prior to pharmacotherapy, and was fortunate not to experience pituitary apoplexy.
