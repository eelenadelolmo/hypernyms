The gallbladder shows focal, segmental wall thickening with possible fundal mass,  and demonstrates multiple comet-tail artifacts extending for the anterior wall.  There is no cholelithiasis, pericholecystic fluid, or other gall bladder abnormality.
Adenomyomatosis confirmed by ultrasound.
Gallbladder carcinoma, emphasematous cholecystitis.  The differential diagnosis of comet-tail artifacts include cholesterol crystals, inspissated colloid in thyroid cysts, gas bubbles in fluid, catheters, surgical clips, and metal.
52 year-old female with right upper quadrant discomfort.
This patient demonstrates signs of all three forms of adenomyomatosis.  Focal wall thickening with a probable fundal mass as seen in the focal form, possible annular wall thickening as seen in the segmental form, and portions of the gallbladder wall that don’t appear thickened, along with diffuse comet tail artifacts as seen in the diffuse form.
