For large diverticuli, surgical correction may be warranted if the patient’s symptoms suggest or if there is malignant degeneration
On barium swallow exams, there is pooling of contrast within a diverticulum above the cricopharyngeous muscle originating in the midline of the posterior wall of the hypopharynx.  This is best appreciated on the lateral view.
Zenker's diverticulum
Zenker’s diverticulum
Killian Jamieson diverticulum
Pseudo-Zenker’s diverticulum
35 year old male with occasional feeling of lump in throat, mainly after eating.
Because this diverticulum is midline, a Killian-Jamieson diverticulum is ruled out.  Also, because this lesion persists throughout the swallow study and does not disappear after the bolus of swallowed food passes into the stomach, a pseudo-Zenker’s diverticulum is excluded.
