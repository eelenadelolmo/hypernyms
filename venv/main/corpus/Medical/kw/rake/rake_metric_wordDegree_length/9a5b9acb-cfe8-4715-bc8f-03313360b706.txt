The polyp was biopsied and sent for pathologic diagnosis.
Treatment for colorectal carcinoma depends on the staging of the disease.  Treatment options include partial or total colectomy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.  Radiation therapy may be used before surgery to shrink the tumor or after surgery as an adjuvant therapy.  If the cancerous polyp is small, generally laparoscopic surgery is utilized due to the decreased amount of side-effects and healing time as compared to open surgery. Once the cancer is staged, the decision to use chemotherapy is determined by presence of local or distal metastasis. (4)
Virtual colonoscopy can create a three dimensional (3D) anatomic model of the colon using data from volumetrically acquired computed tomography (CT) scan (Fig 1A).  An axial slice from the CT scan shows a 9 mm pedunculated polyp in the sigmoid colon, approximately 60 cm from the anus (Fig. 2A).  A 3D endoluminal view of the colon shows a better depiction of the polyp (Fig. 1B, 2A, 3, 4A).

     The patient was recommended to undergo optical colonoscopy (OC) to confirm the presence of the polyp. The OC confirmed the presence of a 1.5 cm pedunculated polyp, located 50 cm from the anus (Fig. 4B).
Invasive Colonic Adenocarcinoma:
Biopsy of the polyp showed micro-invasive colonic adenocarcinoma, without invasion of the lymphatic, vascular, or perineural space.
• Invasive colonic adenocarcinoma
• Intramucosal colonic adenocarcinoma
• Adenoma (tubular, villous, and tubulovillous)
• Hyperplastic polyp 
• Fibroblastic polyp
• Inflammatory polyp
• Lymphoid polyp

Colon cancer is the third most diagnosed (1) malignant neoplasm and second leading cause of cancer related mortality in the United States. (2)  Despite being so deadly, colorectal carcinoma is also one of the most preventable types of cancer.  It is generally recommended that all men and women over the age of 50 get colon cancer screening every 5 to 10 years. (5)  However, it is noted that only approximately 30% of people eligible to get screened actually get screened. (6) This statistic is important because the latency period for colorectal carcinoma is 10 to 20 years.  The traditional gold standard for colorectal screening has been OC, which is invasive, requires sedation, and a full bowel cleanse the day before. This may be too overwhelming for asymptomatic individuals that should be screened.  One hope is that VC will help make the screening process more convenient without jeopardizing the sensitivity and specificity of the test.

Computed tomography (CT) colonography or VC is a technique that utilizes volumetrically acquired helical CT scan of the abdomen to produce two-dimensional and three dimensional images of the colon. (6)  These images can detect colon polyps of varying sizes.  To get the best image of the colon, carbon dioxide is used to inflate the colon through a flexible rectal tube (about the size of a pencil).

Differential considerations for a polyp in the colon include: hyperplastic polyp, fibroblastic polyp, inflammatory polyp, lymphoid polyp, adenoma (tubular, villous, and tubulovillous), intramucosal colonic adenocarcinoma, and invasive colonic adenocarcinoma.  A hyperplastic polyp is a benign growth of the colonic endothelium.  Adenomas are neoplastic benign growths of the colonic epithelium that are direct precursors to adenocarcinoma.  Tubular adenomas arise from tubular glands of the colon wall and account for a majority of adenomas found in the colon.  Villous adenomas develop from the villous projections and only make up 1% of adenomas found within the colon.  Tubulovillous adenomas are a combination of tubular and villous adenomas and account for 5% to 10% of adenomas discovered.  Intramucosal carcinomas are malignant cells confined to the bowel mucosa.  Invasive carcinomas occur when these malignant cells extend into the submucosa of the colon wall. (3)  

In conclusion, VC is a minimally invasive alternative for colorectal screening that has the potential to greatly increase compliance.  There is a national study in progress being conducted by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) (12) to confirm the positive findings from the earlier Department of Defense (DoD) study. The authors believe that VC will have a large positive impact on public health because early detection of colon cancer should substantially reduce the mortality from colon cancer.
