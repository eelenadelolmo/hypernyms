Progressive respiratory distress/tachypnea/ cyanosis/ wheezing/ decreased breath sounds on left
The appropriate treatment of CLE in newborns with respiratory distress is surgical resection of the affected lobe. Conservative management is reasonable in infants who have no or minimal symptoms.
This case was treated with surgical resection.
Hyperlucent lobe(s)- with oligemia
Increased lobar opacity (rare) in newborn due to retained fetal lung fluid 
Compression atelectasis of adjacent parenchyma 
Contralateral mediastinal shift
Congenital Lobar Emphysema- Radiographic findings
Pneumothorax 
Atelectasis with compensatory hyperinflation 
Pneumatocele 
Cyst 
Diaphragmatic hernia 
Cystic adenomatoid malformation
