Texto: 
right nasal mass, diplopia on confrontational testing
chemotherapy
Mass in right maxillary sinus with erosion through inferior orbital floor/maxillary roof, with extension into infero-medial orbital fat of right orbit.
Secondary Orbital large cell lymphoma, Extraconal masses
aggressive lymphoma
squamous cell carcinoma
adenocarcinoma
primary melanoma
inverting papilloma
several months history of right nasal congestion and increasing diplopia, OD.
this was an aggressive NHL which originated in the right maxillary sinus and (uncharacteristically) eroded through the sinus wall. invading the right extra-conal orbit, with evident mass effect on the right globe.
