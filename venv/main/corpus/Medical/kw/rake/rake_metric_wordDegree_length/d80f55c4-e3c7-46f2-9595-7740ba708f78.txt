Texto: 
hyperechoic mass near upper pole of R kidney on US.
Mass arising from adrenal gland w/ fatty attenuation on CT (H.U. of <-30)
MYELOLIPOMA
myelolipoma
angimyolipoma
rapidly progressing acute renal failure
mass arising from adrenal with fatty attenuation on CT is consistent with myelolipoma (see factoid).  This mass was discovered incidentally during work up for acute renal failure.
