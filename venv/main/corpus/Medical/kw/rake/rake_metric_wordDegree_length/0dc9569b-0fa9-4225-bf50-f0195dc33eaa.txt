Swelling and ecchymosis involving the lateral aspect of the left foot.
Non-weight-bearing cast for 6-8 weeks.
AP, lateral and oblique radiographs of the left foot demonstrate a predominantly transverse (slightly oblique) fracture of the proximal diaphysis of the fifth metatarsal that is approximately 2cm from the peroneal tuberosity.  There is no significant displacement or angulation.  Mineralization is within normal limits without lytic or blastic lesions.
Jones fracture
Fracture of the proximal fifth metatarsal diaphysis (Jones fracture)
36-year-old-male presents to the emergency room with complaint of left foot pain.
It seems that fractures of the base of the fifth MT are ones that serve to paint a bulls-eye on a junior residents chest in case conference.  Jones or avulsion fracture?  What is the significance.  The avulsion fracture is located closer to the base of the 5th metatarsus, is the result of an avulsive force by the peroneus brevus tendon when the foot is inverted and is often more obliquely oriented and may extend into the cuboid-metatarsal joint space.  Be careful that the more longitudinally oriented apophysis isn't being mistaken for this fracture in kids.  The Jones fracture is differentiated by being 1.5-2cm from the base, transversely oriented and more of an impact injury.  Unlike the avulsion injuries which heal more easily, the Jones fracture has a much higher association with delayed union, non-union and re-fracture.
