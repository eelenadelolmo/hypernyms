The patient appeared uncomfortable and in significant pain.  

Laboratory values were significant for a urine analysis which demonstrated a large amount of blood with over 100 RBCs.  The UA also showed greater than 300 protein.  The urine culture was negative for growth.  The patient was afebrile and without an elevated white blood cell count.
Patient is being treated nonsurgically.  He is receiving chemotherapy and will be reevaluated with follow up imaging.
Limited evaluation of the unopacified abdominal viscera demonstrates a right peripelvic cyst.  No hydronephrosis is appreciated.  The right ureter is mildly dilated, and there is mild perinephric fat stranding, right greater than left.  However, no pathologic calcifications are seen within the renal collecting systems or along the course of the bilateral ureters.

The posterior bladder wall has a thickened irregular appearance.  HU measurement was 50 consistent with soft tissue.

This contour irregularity was further evaluated on a contrast study.  This showed an extensively thickened posterior bladder wall which did not demonstrate enhancement.  

The ureterovesicle junction is outlined by contrast on the left.  Contrast was not seen to enter through the right ureterovesicle junction.
Primary Lymphoma of the Bladder
Based on the CT findings, transitional cell carcinoma would have to be excluded.  Invasion from prostate cancer would also be a consideration.  In general, focal bladder wall thickening can be seen in acute or chronic inflammation such as cystitis, focal muscle hypertrophy, squamous cell carcinoma,  leiomyosarcoma, neurofibroma, or hemangioma.
39-year old male presented to the emergency room with the complaint of gross hematuria and left flank pain.  A noncontrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis was requested to rule out stones.
Primary lymphoma of the bladder is rare, and less than 100 cases have been discussed in the literature.  Secondary involvement of the bladder by lymphoma from other sites occurs in approximately 13% of patients.  

Primary lymphoma of the bladder is thought to typically affect elderly females with a history of chronic cystitis.  The female to male ration is >6 to 1 with a median age of presentation of 65 years.  This case is certainly unique given that the patient is a young male without a history of chronic bladder infections.  In addition, the lymphoma caused obstruction of the ureterovesicle junction on the right.

Treatment options include observation, chemotherapy and radiation treatment.  Radical surgery has also been performed.  However, according to the literature this is felt to be unnecessary.
