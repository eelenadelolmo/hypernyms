Diffuse lung crackling on ascultation.
No treatment is required for a mild case of pneumomediastinum. Supportive care and oxygen therapy can be used for more serious cases, and hyperbaric oxygen can hasten resolution in severe cases.
Frontal images of the chest and neck together with a lateral image of the neck demonstrating streaky air lucencies.
Pneumomediastinum
Differential diagnosis for these findings include subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, or linear fat densities.
39 y/o male with sudden onset of chest discomfort following a SCUBA dive.
The presumed cause for this patient's pneumomediastinum was a val salva maneuver while SCUBA diving to equalize middle ear pressures.
