No objective weakness on exam. Neurologically intact.
The patient was placed on antiplatelet therapy with full dose aspirin administered daily.  At 1 week, she had progression of neurologic symptoms but imaging revealed no progression of the dissection or infarct.  She was subsequently treated with coumadin for anti-coagulation.
On the right, there is a long segment vertebral artery dissection spanning approximately from C1-C6.  Brain imaging was did not show any restricted diffusion to suggest secondary ischemia.
Vertebral Artery Dissection
Differential diagnosis based on clinical presentation:

Sub-arachnoid hemorrhage
Tension headache
TIA/Stroke
Arterial dissection
33 year old woman with 2 weeks of posterior headache and neck pain, nausea, and intermittent dizziness.  This has been worsening over the last 2 days. She reports subjective paresthesias of both hands as well as left upper extremity weakness.
This patient is near the average age for vertebral artery dissection, which occurs most typically between 30 and 45 years of age.  

Commonly a history of trauma or external neck manipulation is elicited.  Although the patient did not initially report trauma, she did note significant wretching with her nausea and vomiting (presumed gastroenteritis).  This may have been resulted in enough mechanical force to cause her vertebral artery dissection.
