Texto: 
GCS < 7, posturing, subsequent code, intubated
The patient had a Hunt and Hess scale of 5, World Federation of Neurosurgeons class of 5, and Fisher grade of 4. She subsequently expired.
In a patient with a more favorable clinical status in a nontraumatic SAH a ruptured aneurysm should top the list of primary cause and angiography considered.
Hyperdense material in the ambient, crural, interpenduncular, suprasellar, quadrigeminal, sylvian, superior vermian, and cerebello-pontine angle cisterns. 
Hyperdense material in the interhemispheric fissures, 4th ventricle, third ventricle, and layering in dependant portion of ant horns of lateral ventricles.
Nontraumatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)
 - Trauma
 - Aneurysm
 - Coagulopathy
 - Idiopathic
 - Extension of intraparenchymal hemorrhage
 - AVM
Unknown age female found down at restaurant
Occasionally only subtle effacement of sulci is seen when sulci are filled with small amount of blood.  

Several evaluation scores exist for SAH

Hunt and Hess scale
Grade 1: Asymptomatic; or minimal HA + slight nuchal rigidity. ~ survival 70%.
Grade 2: Mod - severe HA; nuchal rigidity; no neurologic deficit except cranial nerve palsy. ~ survival 60%. 
Grade 3: Drowsy; minimal neurologic deficit. ~ survival 50%. 
Grade 4: Stupor; mod - severe hemiparesis; +/- early decerebrate rigidity & vegetative disturbances. ~ survival 20%. 
Grade 5: Deep coma; decerebrate rigidity; moribund. ~ survival 10%. 

World Federation of Neurosurgeons 
Class 1 - GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) 15 
Class 2 - GCS 13-14 without focal neurological deficit 
Class 3 - GCS 13-14 with focal neurological deficit 
Class 4 - GCS 7-12 with/without focal neurological deficit 
Class 5 - GCS <7 with/without focal neurological deficit

Fisher grade
Grade 1= No hemorrhage evident 
Grade 2= Subarachnoid hemorrhage < 1 mm thick 
Grade 3= Subarachnoid hemorrhage > 1 mm thick 
Grade 4= Subarachnoid hemorrhage of any thickness with intra-ventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or parenchymal extension

Complications of SAH: 

Most important vasospasm induced ischemia.

If proteinaceous breakdown products and rbc's reflux into ventricular system this may result in noncommunicating hydrocephalus, if they obstruct the pacchionian granulations a resulting communicating hydrocephalus can develop.

Communicating: free flow between ventricular system and subarachnoid space – with obstruction of flow from basilar cisterns to arachnoid villi or direct impairment with arachnoid villi themselves. Third ventricle and associated interstitial edema may be less.

Noncommunicating: downstream or distal to obstruction may be normal – as distends ependyma threshold to contain exceeded – periventricular interstitial edema.
