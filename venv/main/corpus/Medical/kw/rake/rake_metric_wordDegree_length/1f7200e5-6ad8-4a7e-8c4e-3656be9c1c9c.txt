Pain, knee effusion and decreased range of motion.
Non weight bearing and immobilization, followed by physical therapy. Surgery may be contemplated if the medial patellofemoral ligament is disrupted.
At the lateral rim of the lateral femoral condyle there is a curvilinear area of decreased signal intensity on both T1 and T2 weighted images, consistent with a subchondral fracture.   The fracture is surrounded by diffuse increased T2 signal consistent with marrow edema in this area.  Additionally there is increased T2 signal abnormality seen in the inferomedial aspect of the patella, consistent with contusion secondary to transient lateral patellar dislocation.  There is abnormal T2 signal seen in the medial patellar retinaculum at its insertion point at the medial condyle.  There is mild buckling on the undersurface of the retinaculum but the proximal portion is still taught, consistent with partial disruption.  There is a significant joint effusion identified. The major components for the medial and lateral collateral ligaments are intact.  The ACL and PCL are intact. The medial meniscus and lateral meniscus are intact.
Traumatic Transient Lateral Patellar Dislocation.
NONE.
20-year-old male who fell and sustained direct trauma to the right knee.
