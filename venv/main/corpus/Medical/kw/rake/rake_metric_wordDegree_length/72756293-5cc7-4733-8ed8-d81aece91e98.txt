Pt initially admitted to ICU for hemodynamic monitoring. Pt continued to have anteriograde anmesia for the next 2-3 weeks. Neurologically, he did not show any signs of worsening neurologic deficits.

He continues to be followed with daily neurologic exams; and, he showed slow improvement over the next 2-3 weeks.
Non contrast head CT: Subdural hemorrhage is noted layering along the right aspect of the tentorium.
Subdural hematoma, tentorium

â€¢ contusion 
â€¢ intraparanchymal hemorrhage
â€¢ Subdural hematoma
