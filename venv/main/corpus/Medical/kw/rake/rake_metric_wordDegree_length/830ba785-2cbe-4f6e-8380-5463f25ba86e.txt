No recent physical exam on record
24Jun2004: biopsy of esophagus – no metaplasia present
25June2005: all values of basic metabolic panel are within normal limits
Patient has had stable postoperative films since 2001. Continue with annual biopsies and CT and plain films twice a year for at least five years.
Chest PA: Descending aorta shadow obscured by retrocardiac opacity. 
Chest Lat: Abnormal soft tissue density in a retrocardiac position obscuring the posterior border of left ventricle.  

CT: Dilated esophagus with air contrast level extending from the thoracic inlet to the diaphragm. Lower images show surgical clips.
Gastric pull through
(Lower Middle Mediastinal Mass)
Esophageal processes: achalasia, esophageal mass (leiomyoma), hiatal hernia, or gastric pull through
Tracheal or Esophageal Duplication Cysts
Aortic Ectasia or Aneurysm
46-year-old Caucasian male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the middle third of the esophagus in 2001. Pt is s/p transhiatal esophagectomy and chemoradiation and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Here for follow-up and screening for recurrence.
Malignant epithelial tumors of the esophagus are almost always primary carcinomas. Worldwide, squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) is the most common type and ranks fifth in mortality rate among tumor sites. Genetic predisposition, dietary habits, environmental exposures, and alcohol and tobacco use have all been implicated as causative factors for the disease. 1

Clinically, patients with esophageal cancer present with dysphagia (90%) and/or odynophagia (50%). By the time they seek treatment upwards of 75% have experienced anorexia and weight loss and report considerably altered diets due to luminal compromise. Generally there are no specific physical findings with SCCA. Patients with symptoms of esophageal cancer are often worked up in the following manner. PA and lateral chest radiographs are obtained in those with chronic cough or abnormal findings on chest auscultation to demonstrate metastases or infiltrates suggestive of aspiration or esophagorespiratory fistula.  Findings may include lateral deviation of the mediastinal contents, widening of the mediastinum, and esophageal air-fluid levels. Contrast esophagography using barium is usually indicated to rule out other disorders with similar presentations such as achalasia. Barium swallows in patients with SCAA can demonstrate high-grade stenosis, complete obstruction, and fistulas. Flexible endoscopy is also generally indicated since it allows direct visualization of the esophagus as well as the opportunity to obtain tissue samples. Obtaining at least six biopsy samples yields a diagnosis with an accuracy approaching 100%. Endoscopy aids in accurate characterization of the tumor’s configuration, length, and localization. It also aids in initial relief of dysphagia because dilation can be performed at the same time. 1

Esophageal cancer is considered a treatable disease, but one that is rarely curable. The overall five-year survival rate in patients that are amenable to surgery ranges from 5-20%. Radiation or chemoradiotherapy alone are considered suboptimal primary treatment modalities because of locally persistent or recurrent disease. Current studies suggest combined modality therapy with preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery is acceptable management for patients with stage II and III cancer. Optimal treatment for patients with earlier stage disease is less clear and surgery alone is considered reasonable. 2
