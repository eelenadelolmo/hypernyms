Decreased breath sounds RUL.  No fever.  Normal WBC.  
No history of smoking (js).
The treatment and followup of AIS (BAC) is quite different from other forms of lung cancer.  http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/498197
• Chest radiographs demonstrate consolidation in the right upper lobe with multiple, bilateral nodules.
• Chest CT demonstrates consolidation of the anterior segment of the RUL without volume loss and multiple pulmonary nodules.
Adenocarcinoma in situ (Bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma)
• Bronchogenic carcinoma with metastases
• Infectious consolidation with miliary spread
• Metastatic disease
54 year old woman with a one month history of bronchitis not responding to treatment.
This patient had no signs of infection, so the opacity (air space) was investigated with  bronchoscopy and biopsy.  This case was originally diagnosed as BAC (Bronchoalveolar Carcinoma) - the the WHO 2004 changed this terminology to Adenocarcinoma in situ or AIS.  See Topic for additional information.
