PA radiograph demonstrates a well marginated oval shaped opacity overlying the right 7th posterior rib interspace, in mid-clavicular line.  This opacity is within the anterior segment of the right upper lobe and represents a mucus-plugged bronchi.  
Also there are linear “tram-track” markings radiating from left hilar region peripherally towards the axilla.  These markings are consistent with tubular markings of bronchiectasis.

Lateral radiograph demonstrates the classic bifurcating “V-shaped” opacity, representing the mucus-plugged bronchus seen within the anterior segment of the right upper lobe (correlate with PA radiograph).

Axial CT image taken 1 year before current exacerbation, at the level of the bronchus intermedius, demonstrates the bronchiectatic segment that is currently filled with a mucus plug on today’s plain radiograph.  Again this is within the anterior segment of the right upper lobe.

Axial CT images taken 1 year before current exacerbation demonstrates the central bronchiectatic segments in the left upper lobe that are responsible for the “tram-track” markings on the current plain radiographs.
Allergic BronchoPulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA)
DDX of Well-defined Pulmonary Nodules
1. Primary Bronchogenic CA
2. Metastasis
3. Lymphoma
4. Granulomatous Infx (TB + Fungus)
5. Rare Sarcoidosis
45 y.o. woman with a history of Allergic Broncho-Pulmonary Aspergillosis presents to her pulmonologist with a recent onset of moderate dyspnea and cough.
Given patient&#39;s history and presenting complaints, physical exam findings, elevated IgE, and characteristic radiographic findings, the diagnosis of mucus plugged bronchial was made.
