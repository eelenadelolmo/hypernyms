No focal tenderness - WBC within normal limits - Afebrile
The consultant surgeons chose to follow the patient with US which was repeated approximately 3 months after the original evaluation.
1. A normal appendix is clearly visualized with contrast and air internally, without adjacent fat stranding or wall thickening. 

2. Encapsulating the right ovary and measuring approximately 2.5 x2.1 cm in greatest diameter is a fat and calcium-containing mass which is consistent with a small teratoma.  Free intra-abdominal fluid is present surrounding both ovaries which is most likely physiological.

3. A right ovarian hyperechoic mass with some posterior shadowing coincides with fat and calcium visualized on the comparison CT.
Ovarian Teratoma
Dermoid Cyst (Cystic Teratoma)
Ovarian Carcinoma
20 year-old woman with right lower quadrant and flank pain.
CT was requested to evaluate for appendicitis, which was not present.  As is often the case, the ovarian teratoma was incidentally noted and unlikely to be a source of symptoms.
