Texto: 
Some pain with palpation of the right ear.  Right ear is slightly more protuberant than the left ear. There is no appreciable erythema. There is some tenderness over her mastoid on the right side. The tympanic membrane is also bulging and dull and there is pain for patient when ear is examined.
Initial treatment with IV antibiotics, Unasyn, followed by ENT consult. ENT recommended mastoidectomy with myringotomy and PE tube insertion.
The right mastoid air cells are opacified, and there are erosions of the bony septae and of the the inner and outer table. There is a small area of low attenuation in the soft tissues adjacent to the outer table measuring about 8 x 5 mm consistent with phlegmon or early abscess, although there is not a well defined enhancing wall. The inner table is eroded adjacent to the sigmoid sinus, however the sigmoid sinus enhances normally without evidence of thrombosis, and there is no intracranial abscess identified. Opacification of the air cells also extends toward the petrous apex. The middle ear is opacified, and there is soft tissue thickening in the external auditory canal. There is mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus and bilateral ethmoid sinuses.
Mastoiditis complicating right middle ear infection.
1. Right Mastoiditis
2. Right Otitis Media
3. Right Otitis Externa
