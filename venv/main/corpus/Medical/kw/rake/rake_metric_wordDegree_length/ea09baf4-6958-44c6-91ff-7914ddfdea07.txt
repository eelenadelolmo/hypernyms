8 y.o. girl presents to Emergency Department with visual problems. The patient could not see the board at school.  No history of headaches, no double vision, no nausea, vomiting, or seizures.
Amazingly large mass lesion, isn't it?  This is a testimony to several things:
1) Slow growth of the lesion (craniopharyngioma)
2) The relatively "soft" nature of the cyst
3) The general "plasticity" of the brain
