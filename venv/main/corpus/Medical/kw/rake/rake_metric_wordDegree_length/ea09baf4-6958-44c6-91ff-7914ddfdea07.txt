• Neurologic exam revealed she has a 4/6/4 with no drift. 
• She has visual field defects
Surgical resection and Radiotherapy
» CT
• Large suprasellar fluid-like lesion with peripheral rim calcification.  The fluid is hyperattenuating compared to CSF
» MR
• Suprasellar "cystic" (homogeneous fluid) mass
• Signal hyperintensity (> CSF) on both T1 and T2 sequences
Craniopharyngioma, Adamantinomatous type
• Craniopharyngioma
• Rathke Cleft Cyst
• Hypothalamic/optic chiasm glioma
• Arachnoid Cyst
• Epidermoid or Dermoid Cyst
• Enteric Cyst
8 y.o. girl presents to Emergency Department with visual problems. The patient could not see the board at school.  No history of headaches, no double vision, no nausea, vomiting, or seizures.
Amazingly large mass lesion, isn't it?  This is a testimony to several things:
1) Slow growth of the lesion (craniopharyngioma)
2) The relatively "soft" nature of the cyst
3) The general "plasticity" of the brain
