Vitals: BP 130/75 P 95 T 99.9oF
Gen: well nourished and developed.  MS: alert and oriented X3. Chest.Lungs:  RRR no M/R/G  CTA bil.  AB: nondistended, TTP with guarding, no palpable masses, BS+.  Ext: no cyanosis clubbing or edema.
Labs:  bHCG negative.  WBC 13.2 H/H 14/40 plt 123  85%neutr.  Amylase/lipase normal
Emergent Laproscopic Appendectomy
CT scan abdomen:  Positive “arrowhead sign” in appendix.  Presence of thickened appendix.  Questionable appendicolith.  Terminal ileum normal and seen with contrast,  Good visualization of ileocecal juntion. Cecum normal size without evidence of edema.
Acute appendicitis
Diff from History: Appendicitis, Ectopic pregnancy, Crohns Dz, Mesenteric adenitis
Diff from viewing CT:  Appendicitis from… lymphoprolifertation, apendicolith, cecal obstruction of proximal opening (cancer)
34 y/o WF w/ abdominal pain for past 30hrs.  Pain started midepigastric and has moved slightly inferior and to the right.  No radiation and no relief with oral meds.  Has had nausea but no vomiting.  Denies fevers, chills, melena, hematachezia, constipation, diarrhea.  Anorexia for 30 hrs. No BM since pain began.  LMP unknown.
In the ED the patient clearly had a diffusely tender abdomen, with evidence of appendicitis.  B-HCG was used to rule out ectopic preg and amylase and lipase were normal.  Likely the patient clinical picture was not overtly obvious for appendicitis (while on paper it seems that way) or else a CT scan should not have been done.  Her CT showed clear evidence of thickening in the appendix with fat stranding.  In addition, there was a positive arrowhead sign, which is indicative of appendicitis.   Finally, the terminal ileum was visible with contrast and showed no evidence of inflammation or changes.  The most likely cause of appendicitis is lymphoproliferation (most common cause of appendicitis) or a fecolith.  The path report is still pending.
