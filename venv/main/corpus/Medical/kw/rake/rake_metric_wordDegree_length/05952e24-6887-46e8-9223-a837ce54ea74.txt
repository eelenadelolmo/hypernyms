PE: 3-4cm nodule in left thyroid gland
TFTs:  FT4: 0.96     TSH<0.08
RAIU: 4hr: 13.9%     24hr 15.2%
Options: 
1) Wait and follow, may involute spontaneously
2) Surgery
3) 30mCi I-131

If the nodule is removed either by surgery or radioactive iodine, patient will now have a "cold" nodule, which does not require a biopsy or follow-up.  Remainder of the normal thyroid issue, depending on the method of treatment may show function again as stimulated by TSH.
Large focal area of increased radiotracer uptake in the left thyroid gland corresponding to the nodule felt on exam. Remainder of the thyroid gland demonstrates no uptake.
Autonomous functioning thyroid nodule.
Autonomous nodule (Plummer's Disease)
Feels a lump in her neck
