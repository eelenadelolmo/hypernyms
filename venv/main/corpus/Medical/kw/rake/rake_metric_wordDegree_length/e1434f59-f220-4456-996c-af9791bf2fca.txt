VITAL SIGNS: Afebrile. Normal vital signs.
GENERAL: Alert, nontoxic. Pale-appearing, but no acute distress.  
HEENT: PERRLA. No obvious abnormalities in extraocular movements with the exception of horizontal nystagmus. >5 beats horizontal nystagmus  noted to right, 2-3 beats noted to the left.  No vertical nystagmus. Unable to visualize optic discs. NECK: Supple without meningismus. 
NEUROLOGIC: Alert. Cranial nerves II-XII intact. Motor strength 5/5 & symmetric throughout. Subtle unsteadiness noted on Romberg as well as very mild dysmetria with finger-to-nose testing on left, but not the right. Able to walk with a tandem gait, but with some difficulty. No gross ataxia.
Treatment: Total gross resection of the right cerebellar mass with ventriculostomy placed right posterior fossa & right posterior fossa craniotomy.

Follow-Up: Patient is doing well without headaches. Follow-Up MRI surveillance to be performed with PCP q 3 months
CT of head without contrast 	
- Right cerebellar tumor, both cystic and solid components. Effacement of the fourth ventricle with moderate hydrocephalus. 	

MR BRAIN W AND W/O CONTRAST, TOTAL SPINE W 
1. Mixed cystic and solid lesion measuring 6.2 x 5.5 x 7.7 cm in the right cerebellum. Lesion causing extensive mass effect with displacement of the fourth ventricle. Also protrudes slightly through the foramen magnum.
Pilocytic Astrocytoma, WHO grade I
1. Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytoma
2. Haemangioblastoma
8 year old female with persistent generalized headache x 3.5 weeks. Occurs at all times of day, but child has also awakened at night from the pain. Minimal relief with Tylenol and Motrin but headaches recur shortly thereafter. No history of headaches, seizures or head trauma. No family history of migraines.  Review of systems positive for decreased activity level. Otherwise, no visual changes, change in speech, gait or behavior.  No fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or decreased appetite.
This case is a very classic representation of pilocytic astrocytoma in its presentation. The patient is in her first decade of life and presents with chronic, persistent headache. Pilocytic astrocytomas most commonly occur in cerebellum, as was seen in this case. The tumor is well-circumscribed with smooth margins and also has what appears to be an associated mural nodule.
