Masses in the anterior mediastinum have a higher likelihood of malignancy compared to masses in other mediastinal compartments. Treatment of anterior mediastinal teratomas is surgical excision because up to 25 percent of cases may progress to malignancy.
PA and lateral chest radiographs: Well-circumscribed lesion in left anterior thorax silhouetting the left hilum on frontal projection. No hilar lymphadenopathy appreciated. Mild interstitial thickening of the perihilar regions.

CT: Large well-circumscribed mass within anterior mediastinum containing solid tissue components as well as fat and calcium. It has mass effect on adjacent structures without evidence of occlusion.
Anterior Mediastinal Teratoma
Teratoma - benign or malignant
Thymoma

Thyroid mass
Mediastinal cyst
Metastatic disease
Seminoma
Embryonal tumor
Lymphadenopathy
22yo female smoker with chronic persistent cough and scattered wheezes.
Germ cell tumors account for approximately 15 percent of all anterior mediastinal tumors in adults and benign teratomas are the most common anterior mediastinal germ cell tumor. They occur with similar frequency in men and women and have increased incidence between 20-40 years of age. In addition to this patient's age and the location of her tumor, the makeup of the tumor is key in making the diagnosis of teratoma. Teratomas contain tissue derived from at least two of the three primitive germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. As such, they may contain fat, hair, teeth, bone, cartilage, smooth muscle, skin, sweat glands, as well as respiratory or intestinal epithelium and pancreatic tissue. This patient's CT showed solid tissue components as well as calcification and fat, which is virtually pathognomonic of a teratoma.
