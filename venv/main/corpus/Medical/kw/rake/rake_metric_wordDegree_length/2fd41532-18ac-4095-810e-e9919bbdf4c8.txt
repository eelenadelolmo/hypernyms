Texto: 
Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and increased pulmonary blood flow.
Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)
Atrial septal defect
Ventricular septal defect
Patent Ductus Arteriosus
Endocardial Cushion Defect
Asymptomatic; murmur heard on routine physical exam.
Note that the aortic arch does not appear enlarged on the frontal view, and the left atrium appeared normal on the lateral view.   A ventricular septal defect (VSD) would be expected to cause left atrial enlargement.  A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) would enlarge the aortic arch.   VSD's are usually found earlier in life and ASD's are more likely to be discovered incidentally later on, as in this case.  Thus the favored diagnosis was atrial septal defect (ASD).
