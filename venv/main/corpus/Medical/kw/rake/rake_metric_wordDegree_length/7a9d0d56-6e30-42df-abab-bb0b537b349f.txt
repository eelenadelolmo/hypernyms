Texto: 
PE: Left hip is held flexed, abducted, externally rotated.
LABS: Normal CRP, ESR, WBC.
NSAIDs may shorten the duration of symptoms. 

Patients with TS usually experience marked improvement within 24-48 hours. Two thirds to three fourths of patients with TS have complete resolution within 2 weeks. The remainder may have less-severe symptoms for several weeks.

The recurrence rate is 4-17%; most recurrences develop within 6 months

If significant symptoms persist for 7-10 days after the initial presentation, consider other diagnoses. 

Advise that all patients with TS have repeat radiographs within 6 months to exclude LCP disease.
Ultrasound of the hips demonstrates a left-sided hip effusion measuring approximately  2.9 cm (CC) x 0.8 cm (TRV), asymmetric when compared to the right hip. The joint fluid demonstrates diffuse low level echoes.
