PE: normal
Labs:TSH of 0.643 uIU/ml
Ultrasound: 1.  LARGE HETEROGENEOUS SOLID/CYSTIC NODULE WITH MULTIPLE INTERNAL SEPTATIONS AND ECHOES LOCATED AT THE LOWER POLE OF THE LEFT THYROID GLAND.  SECOND, SMALLER AND MORE HOMOGENEOUS HYPOECHOIC NODULE IS SEEN MORE POSTERIORLY
WITHIN THE LEFT LOWER POLE.  RECOMMEND FURTHER WORKUP WITH THYROID UPTAKE AND SCAN AND CONSIDERATION OF BIOPSY TO EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF MALIGNANCY


AGENT:   I-131          DOSE:  7.49 uCi
AGENT:   Tc99m          DOSE:  9.91 mCi

PROCEDURE:    24 hours following radiotracer ingestion, the radioactive iodine uptake (24 RAIU) was determined.  Following pertechnetate injection
planar and pinhole images were obtained of the neck from the anterior and anterior oblique projections.  Acquisition time were determined and
scintillation images were reviewed and physical exam was performed to collaborate findings. No previous studies available for review.

FINDINGS:    The 24 hour RAIU was equal to 5.5%, normal is 8 - 30%.

Acquisition times for pinhole images range from 283 seconds to 420 seconds,
(normal is 150 - 200 seconds).

The planar pinhole images showed a normally sized gland with regular contour and the thyroid gland lying within the thyroid bed with generally decreased trapping throughout.  However, there was an area of questionably, slightly increased uptake within the
right lower pole medially which most likely is due to slight rotation of the patient.

Physical exam shows a non-tender noamally-sized thyroid gland with no palpable nodules, and most recent thyroid function tests for this patient were performed on 16APR02 demonstrating a TSH of 0.643 uIU/ml.

IMPRESSION:

1.   LOW 24 HOUR RADIOACTIVE IODINE UPTAKE OF 5.5%.

2.   SCINTIGRAPHIC EXAM WITH NO EVIDENCE OF HOT OR COLD NODULES.
Thyroid nodules of undetermined significance.
-Euthyroidism with multinodular gland
-Significant exogenous iodine intake
Pt found to have thyroid nodules on carotid ultrasound, then was followed up with dedicated thyroid ultrasound.  Patient denies any thyroid-related symptoms
In our asymptomatic patient with a normal (i.e. low-normal) TSH the concern was to differentiate the thyroid nodules seen on the prior ultrasound, in order to determine if the nodules were hyperfunctioning “hot”, hypofunctioning “cold”, or intermediate “warm”.  Thyroid malignancy makes up .1% of all cancers; but up to 4-7% of the population may have palpable nodules on physical exam and up to 40% have nodules seen on ultrasound or other imaging.  If a single cold nodule is found on thyroid scintigraphy, the risk of cancer is 5 to 40%.  Less than 1% of hot nodules are cancerous.  Our patient demonstrated a very low uptake of I131 with a low/normal TSH.  The patient denied taking any medication which might affect thyroid function such as Synthroid, PTU, or Lugol’s solution.  On further questioning, the patient admitted to a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis three weeks previously in which he stated that contrast was injected into his arm.  CT contrast is iodinated and will concentrate in the thyroid gland.  Based on this information, it was concluded that the iodinated contrast blocked uptake of the I131 and resulted in a flawed study.  Had this information been placed in the patient’s history, we would have waited a number of months to perform the scan.

It would have been reasonable to simply perform a fine needle aspiration (FNA) with ultrasound guidance, instead of first performing a scan.
