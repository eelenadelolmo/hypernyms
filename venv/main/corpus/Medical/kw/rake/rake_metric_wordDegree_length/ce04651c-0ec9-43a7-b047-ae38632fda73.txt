Texto: 
Left nasal cavity - Reddish, friable mass seen occupying the floor extending through the choana into the nasopharynx.  Perforation was seen in the anterior portion of the nasal septum (cartilagenous portion). Mass could be seen extending through the perforation in to the right nasal cavity.

Complete hemogram - Within normal limits
Xray chest - Normal
ECG - Normal
Blood urea/ sugar - Normal limits
Mass was excised in toto and sent for HPE.  The patient was started on Dapsone 100mg/ day for 1 year.  This is to prevent recurrence.
CT scan paranasal sinuses showed
1. Perforation in the cartilaginous portion of the septum
2. Presence of mass in the nasopharynx can be clearly seen.
3. The walls of the paranasal sinuses were found to be intact.
Rhinosporidiosis nasal cavity with septal perforation
1. Rhinosporidiosis 
2. Angioma
3. Granuloma
4. Foreign body granuloma
30 y.o. man with bleeding and locked sensation from left nose for 10 years. He has had a goul smelling discharge from left nose for 1 year.  Now he has bleeding from both nares for 6 months.  There is a history of taking bath in freshwater ponds.
Rhinosporidiosis is a common condition seen in the nasal cavity.  This is particularly endemic in parts of south India and Sri Lanka. It is caused by an organism known as Rhinosporidium Seeberi.   This case is posted here because of the concurrent presence of septal perforation.  Septum is highly resistant to perforation by mass lesion.  Even malignant lesions are not known to perforate nasal septum.  In this case rhinosporidiosis has caused perforation of nasal. septum.  This could possibly be explained by chronic perichondritis of septal cartilage due to rhinosporidiosis causing its dissolution.
