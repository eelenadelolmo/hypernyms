PE was noncontributory.  Thyroid was non tender, not enlarged, and no nodules were palpated.
Free T4: 3.16 (nl 0.71-1.85)
TSH: <0.08 (nl 0.49-4.67)
T3: 154 (nl 59-174)
Thyroglobulin antibody: <2.0 (nl)
Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin:92   (nl)
CRP: 0.109 (nl 0-0.7)
The diagnosis of thyroiditis was made by exclusion of other causes.

No treatment was given (expectant management), and the patient will follow up over the next 1-2 months with his endocrinologist.
Heterogeneously decreased uptake of radiotracer throughout both lobes of the thyroid.
4 hour radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU): 1.1%
24 hour RAIU: 0.8%
Subacute Thyroiditis
DDX FOR MARKEDLY DECREASED TRACER UPTAKE:
-factitious/iatrogenic thyroid hormone ingestion
-Increased iodine pool (e.g. recent contrast media study or exogenous iodine)
-anti-thyroid medicine
-acute or subacute thyroiditis
-ectopic thyroid tissue
-struma ovarii
-toxic intrathoracic goiter
63 yo M w/ PMH significant for mitral valve replacement 3 years ago who now complains of 2-3 month h/o 30 pound weight loss, decreased appetite, increased fatigue, and occasional light headedness.  The patient had no h/o recent viral illnesses.
The patient was very concerned about his symptoms, specifically his loss of weight.  He had already been to an oncologist who "ruled out" a malignancy.  There was some discussion with the endocrinologist of initiating steroids, but it was decided that the risks outweighed the benefits.  Therefore, after educating the patient about the nature and expected timecourse of this self-limited illness, the clinical team decided on expectant management.
