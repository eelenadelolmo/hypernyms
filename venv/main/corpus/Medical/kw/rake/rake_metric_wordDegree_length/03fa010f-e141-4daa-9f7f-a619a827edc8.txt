Texto: 
The vital signs are normal and the patient is in no acute distress.  The left knee is mildly swollen, with some tenderness over the lateral knee.  The physical exam is somewhat limited secondary to the patients discomfort.
Orthopedic follow-up with possible repair of the anterior cruciate ligament and menisci if damaged.
The plain film radiographs of the left knee demonstrates an avulsion fracture along the lateral proximal tibia.  There is no significant joint effusion noted on this image.  Coronal T1 and T2 MRI images demonstrate an avulsion fracture of the lateral proximal tibia and a joint effusion.  There is marrow edema present and the anterior cruciate ligament is torn.
Segond Fracture with Asssociated Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tear
Segond Fracture.  When this fracture is identified or suspected, MRI is indicated to evaluate for ACL and menisci injury, which are present in this case.
28 year old male with left knee injury while wakeboarding.
