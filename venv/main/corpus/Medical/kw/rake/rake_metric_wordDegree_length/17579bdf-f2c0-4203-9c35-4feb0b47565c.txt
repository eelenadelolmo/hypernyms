Ultrasound revealed multiple stones in the gallbladder. See summary of image findings.

Surgical findings (laproscopic cholecystectomy):
A very large, distended gallbladder, consistent with acute cholecystitis. Additionally, pathology revealed many 1-2cm sized cholesterol gallstones.
Plain film radiographs failed to demonstrate suspicious soft tissue calcifications, masses, free air or evidence of ileus.

Ultrasound demonstrated thickening of the gall bladder wall without pericholecystic fluid.  There were multiple shadowing mobile calcifications, but a single calcification in the neck of the gall bladder failed to move with changes in position, suggesting that it was impacted.
Acute Symptomatic Cholecystitis
• Acute Cholecystitis
• Chronic Choleyctitis
• Cholangitis
• Gallbladder Mucocele
• Gallbladder Tumor
Patient is an 18-year-old girl, unknown parity, who presents to ER with acute right upper quadrant pain and fever.  She has a family history of gallstones and currently takes oral contraceptives.

This patient presented classically with acute right upper quadrant pain and fever. Additionally, she has the following risk factors: 1) a positive family history of gallstones and 2) currently takes oral contraceptive pills. Like most patients with cholecystitis, her lab values were not helpful in reaching a diagnosis. She did not have an elevated white count and her hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet values were all normal. Her total bilirubin was normal, therefore, it did not indicate an obstruction. She had a normal amylase and a mildly increased lipase at 226 U/L (normal lipase in children over 11 years old is between 10-220 U/L).  

Imaging revealed the diagnosis. Although plain films failed to demonstrate  the radiolucent gallstones, ultrasound demonstrated multiple shadowing mobile calcifications and thickening of the gallbladder wall. No further tests were necessary. The patient receved a  laproscopic cholecystectomy and was improved. 

Acute cholecystitis is relatively rare in children and is usually associated with hematologic abnormalities such as sickle cell or with chronic diseases.  This may be changing however with increased exposure to oral contraceptives and modern high fat diets.
