endoscopic decompression of ureterocele with basket extraction of calculus
A duplicated collecting system is present on the left side. Two ureters can be followed to the level of the mid pelvis. There is apparent fusion of the ureters, although the precise junction is not demonstrated. A single ureter is visualized below this point. The UVJ occurs in a normal position, however a ureterocele is demonstrated at this point. Within this ureterocele a 6mm calculus is present.

53 y/o Caucasian male presents with LUTS, specifically frequency and urgency over the last several months. Patient denies hematuria or dysuria. Patient also reports 30-pack year history of cigarette use.
Duplex renal collecting systems are congenital malformations of embryonic development leading to duplicated ipsilateral ureters. At four weeks gestation the ureteric bud blanches out from the mesonephric duct. The ureteric bud extends out to interact with the metanephric blastema; this interaction catalyzes the bud‚Äôs differentiation into renal calyces, pelvis, and ureter. At the same time the metanephric blastema differentiates into the various functional components of the nephron. The location of the original ureteric bud relative to the metanephric blastema determines the eventual position of the ureteral-vesicular junction. The bud‚Äôs proximal distance from the mesonephric blastema is inversely proportional to its migration across the developing bladder; the more proximal the bud the more medial and caudal its eventual insertion. The bud can also split during migration lead to a bifid ureter or progress to two entirely duplicated collecting systems.
	It has been estimated that duplex collecting systems are present in up to 0.8% of the general population, making it one of the most common congenital malformations. In more recent times the pervasiveness of antenatal ultrasound has lead to an increasing number of duplicated collecting systems diagnosed in utero. Of those patients not diagnosed in utero the great majority are asymptomatic and are only discovered as incidental findings. Ultrasound (US) has been shown to be a specific but nonsensitive study when used in the evaluation of duplex systems in both adult and pediatric patients. In these populations it is possible to demonstrate dilated, dysplastic upper poles and dilated distal ureters via US. Sonography can also be used to evaluate renal parenchymal thickness and bladder anomalies.  At present time excretory urography (EU) remains the gold-standard in evaluation of duplex systems. The contrast-enhanced silhouettes of the duplicated renal anatomy as seen on excretory urograms have lead to several ‚Äúclassic‚Äù uroradiographic signs.  Commonly a nonfunctional upper pole will not appear on EU, but will cause a downward displacement of the lower pole. This displacement has lead some to compare the lower pole to a drooping flower, or ‚Äúdrooping lily‚Äù sign. In some cases, particularly with upper pole dysfunction functional renal scans are indicated. Typically 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) can be used to evaluate the relative function of each renal segment. 
 The relative anatomy of the duplicated system lends to several structural flaws. As described by the Weigert-Meyer rule duplicated ureters tend to insert in a fairly predictable way based on their expected embryonic migration. Upper pole ureters tend to insert into the distal-medial bladder leading to greater rates of obstruction and ureterocele, while lower pole ureters insert more proximal medially resulting in greater incidences of reflux. Clinical manifestations of duplex systems tend to depend on age and sex of the patient. Recurrent UTIs tend to be the most common presentation of duplex systems in general, with more specific manifestations related to age and sex. Pediatric patients can present with failure-to-thrive secondary to reflux-induced renal dysfunction. Female patients may complain of urinary incontinence secondary to an ectopic ureter or bladder outlet obstruction from an associated ureterocele. Male patients remain continent in the presence of an ectopic ureter but can experience episodes of epididymitis. All adult patients can experience urostasis along with stone formation.
	As previously mentioned ureteroceles are commonly associated with duplex systems. Ureteroceles are out-pouchings of the distal ureter resulting from incomplete canalization of the ureteral bud. Ureteroceles confined to the bladder are categorized as intravesicular, while those occurring outside of the bladder are termed ectopic. Similar to the evaluation of duplex systems, today the majority of ureteroceles are diagnosed by antenatal maternal ultrasound. Excretory urography is diagnostic and may demonstrate a characteristic filling defect commonly known as the ‚Äúcobra head‚Äù. Sonography is currently the study of choice in most centers and usually demonstrated a characteristic ‚Äúcysts within a cysts‚Äù appearance.
