Unremarkable.
This lesion was surgically removed.
Sagittal T1 and axial fat suppressed fast spin echo T2-weighted MR images through the neck show a 2 cm well-circumscribed fluid signal intensity mass
arising from the anterolateral soft tissues at the right paramedian region of the neck, at a level just superficial to the anterior apex of the thyroid cartilage.  On the axial image, the infrahyoid strap muscles are noted to "beak" over the edges of this cystic lesion.
Thyroglossal duct cyst
These imaging features are essentially pathognomonic for a thyroglossal duct cyst.
A 32-year-old male with a prior MRI of the C-spine demonstrating an incidentally-noted soft tissue mass in a right strap muscle.
When a thyroglossal duct cyst is present in a location inferior to the level of the hyoid bone, as in this case, the key to diagnosis remains its midline location and its characteristic anatomic relationship to the infrahyoid strap muscles.  In general, the more inferior the location of the cyst, the more likely it is to reside in a paramedian, rather than midline, location.
