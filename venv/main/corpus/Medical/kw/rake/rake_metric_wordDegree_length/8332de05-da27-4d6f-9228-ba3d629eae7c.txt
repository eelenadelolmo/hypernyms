There are multiple foci of increased T2 signal within the vertebral bodies, most prominent at L4-5. Many of these are  associated with T1 hyperintensity and are likely degenerative in nature; however, some are associated with T1 hypointensity and may represent edema. In addition there is a focus of T2 hyperintensity with apparent membrane extending posterior to the L3 vertebral body through the L3-4 interspace and    
down to the L4-5 interspace in the anterior epidural space.  This finding, in  combination with the T2 hyperintensities within the vertebral bodies and loss of associated disk spaces is concerning for an epidural abscess.  The           
anterior fluid collection does produce moderate mass effect on the central canal at these levels

Postcontrast images of the lumbar spine demonstrate thickened and peripheral enhancement of the fluid collection posterior to the lower lumbar vertebral bodies, consistent with epidural abscess.  There is mild enhancement in the adjacent L4-5 disk space and vertebral body suggesting       
some component of diskitis and osteomyelitis along with the epidural abscess, however this findings could also be consistent with chronic degenerative changes.
Lumbar Spine, Epidural Abscess with Osteomyelitis/Discitis

Osteomyelitis/Discitis usually affects at least two vertebrae around an affected disc, destruction greatest at endplates, posterior elements relatively spared.  Decreased on T1, Increased on T2, with contrast enhancement. Disc spared with non-pyogenic infections like TB, fungus. The epidural abscess usually is mostly granulation tissue that extends within the epidural space, as many as 3-4 interspaces.  Very little room to expand axially and can lead to cord compression.   

Neoplastic lesions differ from pyogenic infection in that they involve the vertebral bodies diffusely and irregularly but non-contiguously, sparing the discs, with epidural mass and enhancement limited to the levels of the pathologic vertebrae.  Pedicles most commonly affected. Exception: Disc sparing non-pyogenic infections. Lymphoma is an exception, with a more extensive epidural mass.
