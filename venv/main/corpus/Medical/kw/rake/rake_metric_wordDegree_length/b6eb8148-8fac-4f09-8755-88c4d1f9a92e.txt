Multiple axial CT images obtained at 5mm collimation through the lower abdomen demonstrate a multiloculated pancreatic mass with a central fibrous/calcified center. The Hounsfeld units are approximately 8 for this mass consistent with water density. The previous CT in 1995 demonstrates no change in the size or characteristics of this mass.
Serous Cystadenoma of the Pancreas
1.	Mucinous cystadenoma (having malignant potential)
2.	Pseudocyst
3.	Variants of ductal adenocarcinoma
4.	Cystic islet cell tumor
5.	Lymphangioma
