Texto: 
Eccentric soft tissue thickening bilateral 1st MTP joints, with amorphous soft tissue calcifications.  Joint spaces are well preserved.  Note bilateral erosions with sclerotic margins and spike of bone formation in left first metatarsal head consistent with overhanging edges.
Gout
Rheumatoid arthritis
Psoriatic arthritis
Osteoarthritis
CPPD
Pain and swelling in the bilateral first metatarsophalangeal joints.
Rheumatoid arthritis – unlikely with normal mineralization and joint spaces, overhanging edges, and eccentric soft tissue swelling

Osteoarthritis – not with the erosions

Psoriatic arthritis – Not since there is no joint space loss and no fusiform soft tissue swelling

CPPD  - less likely given lack of chondrocalcinosis, atypical locale, lack of joint space narrowing, and tophi and erosions
