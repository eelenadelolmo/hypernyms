21 year old man with a 2 month history of abdominal pain, weight loss, fevers, and chills.
â€¢Lymphomas are divided into Hodgkinâ€™s and non-Hodgkinâ€™s.
â€¢Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma is characterized by Reed-Sternberg cells, with 4 subtypes.
â€¢In the thorax, nodular sclerosing is the most common subtype with a predilection for the mediastinum.
â€¢Nodular sclerosing accounts for >50% of Hodgkinâ€™s lymphomas.
â€¢Frequency - In the US, 7400 estimated new cases in 2001
â€¢Bimodal distribution - 15-40 years old, >55 years old
â€¢Treatment consists of radiation and/or chemotherapy
â€¢Survival rates, 1yr-93%, 5yr-82%, 10yr-72%, 15yr-63%
