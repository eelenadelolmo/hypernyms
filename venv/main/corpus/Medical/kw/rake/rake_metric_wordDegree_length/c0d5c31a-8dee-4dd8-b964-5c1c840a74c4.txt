Vitals: T 97.9, P 64, BP 110/44, RR 28, Wt 25.9 kg, Ht 124 cm
Gen: Active 6 y/o male in NAD
H/N: EOMI, TM clear b/l, supple neck, no lymphadenopathy  
CV: RRR no m/g/r.
Lungs: Diffuse rales at RML and RLL, however, no accessory muscles of respiration used.
Pt was given another course of azithromycin at a higher dose to better cover Mycoplasma pneumonia: 250 mg po x 5 days.
There is minimal obscuration of the right costophrenic angle which could represent atelectasis or a small pleural effusion. There is also an opacification in the right middle lung lobe that sillhouettes the right heart border.
Right Middle Lobe Pneumonia
Asthma (cough variant)
Foreign Body Aspiration
Pneumonia
Post viral cough
GERD
Bordetella Pertussis
6 y/o otherwise healthy male treated for cough with azithromycin five days prior to current presentation.  Pt has returned to clinic because cough has not remitted. Does not complain of ear pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, wheezing, or SOB, and pt has been afebrile since cough started two weeks prior to current presentation.
This 6 y/o boy had radiologic findings consistent with a right middle lobe pneumonia and was treated empirically for Streptococcus pneumoniae originally, but with persistent symptoms his dose of azithromycin was increased to cover Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
