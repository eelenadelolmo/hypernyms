The junctional parenchymal defect, also known as the interrenuncular junction, is a triangle-shaped hyperechoic defect. This defect is caused by the incomplete fusion of the embryologic upper and lower poles. of the kidney It is located at the anterior aspect at junction of the upper and middle third of the kidney. 

This defect can be seen communicating with the renal sinus at the hilum at the level the renal vessels exit the kidney. 

This defect may be mistaken for a cortical scar or mass. It can be differentiated from these by its typical location, characteristic triangular shape and communication with the renal sinus fat.
