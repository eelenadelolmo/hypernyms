â€¢ PA chest radiograph demonstrates left lung volume loss, silhouetting of the left cardiac border, and Luftsichel sign.

â€¢ Lateral chest radiograph shows anterior displacement of the major fissure and elevation of the left mainstem bronchus.

â€¢ CT of the chest reveals an obstructing mass and resultant LUL collapse.
Left upper lobe collapse caused by an enlarging, obstructing small cell lung carcinoma.
This combination of radiographic findings are consistent with LUL collapse and highly suspicious for an underlying endobronchial mass causing obstruction of the LUL bronchus.
60-year-old woman presents with chest pain and shortness of breath.
This woman had known small cell lung carcinoma.  The radiographic findings described above are diagnostic of left upper lobe collapse.  Such a finding should raise suspicion for an underlying obstructing mass.  In this case, the patient presents with a known diagnosis of small cell lung carcinoma.  Thus CT is not required to confirm collapse or the cause of collapse.
