Vitals within normal limits; No abnormalities on physical exam
Surgical excision with left lower lobectomy was curative.  He had no complications from the surgery and was instructed to follow-up in the clinic to evaluate respiratory compensation from remaining lung tissue.
Axial chest CT with contrast demonstrates a triangular-shaped mass in the left lower lung measuring 4.0cm x 3.1cm x 2.1cm.  There is homogenous contrast enhancement of the mass. The feeding artery to the mass arises from the proximal portion of the abdominal aorta. Venous drainage arising from the mass empties into the left atrium.
Intralobar Pulmonary Sequestration
Pulmonary mass on prenatal US:

-Bronchogenic Cyst
-Congenital Lobar Emphysema (CLE)
A 29 year-old G1P0 mother at 20 weeks gestation presents to the clinic for routine prenatal care. Transabdominal ultrasound was notable for a lesion in the fetal left lung.  Cyst volume ratio was measured to be 0.77 at the time.  Fetal weight, height, and head circumference measured at the time were appropriate for gestational age.  The mother was followed in the prenatal clinic weekly to monitor the pregnancy and the lung mass. The rest of the pregnancy was uncomplicated and resulted in the spontaneous vaginal delivery of a healthy baby boy.
Close followup for 5 days after birth was unremarkable. He remained healthy and up to date on medical appointments and immunizations.  The parents report no respiratory issues during the previous four months. At five months age, he returned to the clinic for follow-up of the lung mass found during prenatal screening.  Chest CT with contrast was ordered at the time to re-evaluate the pulmonary mass.
Pulmonary sequestration (more formally bronchopulmonary sequestration) is a congenital abnormality of the airway.  It is a mass of non-functioning lung tissue that is supplied by its own systemic circulation and its bronchi are not continuous with the normal bronchial tree.[1] The exact embryologic pathogenesis is unknown, but is hypothesized that additional pulmonary tissue develops in an early stage of pulmonary organogenesis prior to separation of systemic and pulmonary circulation.[1]  This best explains the abnormal circulation and variety of anatomic locations that pulmonary sequestration may present itself.
As mentioned above, the defining characteristics of pulmonary sequestration are: 1)no airway connection to the tracheobronchial tree and 2) it receives its blood supply from systemic, rather than pulmonic circulation.  There are two subtypes of pulmonary sequestration: intralobar pulmonary sequestration (IPS) and extralobary pulmonary sequestration (EPS).  [1] IPS is the most common type of sequestration(75%). It is located within an existing lobe of the lung and it lacks its own visceral pleura. EPS is less common (25% of cases), has its own visceral pleura, can be located above or below the diaphragm, and is correlated with the presence of other congenital abnormalities.[1,3] It is interesting to note that either IPS or EPS can present as a hybrid lesion with a congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), in which case the abnormal lung tissue receives its blood supply from systemic circulation, but has an airway that it at least partially continuous with the normal tracheobronchial tree.  
On ultrasounds and chest x-ray, pulmonary sequestration usually appears as a uniformly dense mass within the lungs. CT is the imaging study of choice to visualize the lesion because it provides adequate visualization of the lesion at a reasonable cost.[2]  However, the appearance of pulmonary sequestration is variable on CT.  Systemic blood supply can usually be visualized, but smaller vasculature can be difficult to appreciate on CT.  Pulmonary sequestration will usually appear as a solid homogenous mass on CT, but may show cystic change.[2] Regardless, imaging with CT can be useful in detecting and developing suspicion for the condition. Still, pathologic examination of the segment in question following surgical removal is the only method for establishing a definitive diagnosis.
Prenatal ultrasound is useful to assess the cyst volume ratio (CVR), where the volume of the lung mass is divided by fetal head circumference.  A CVR > 1.6 has over a 75% risk for the development of fetal hydrops. With a CVR<1.6 the risk of developing hydrops is 10%[7]. After birth, about 15% of infants will experience respiratory distress at the time of birth, indicating the need for immediate surgical intervention. The remaining 85% will be asymptomatic until later in life.  If untreated, pulmonary sequestration can result it recurrent infection, or rarely, progression to malignancy or high-output heart failure.  Some argue that curative surgical resection of the lesion between aged 6 months to 1 year is the best management to avoid potential sequelae of the disease, but others argue that risks of cardiothoracic surgery outweigh the benefits due to the low rate of sequelae occurring.
