Physical exam shows limited subtalar motion. Frequently pes planus (flat foot) and peroneal spasm are also present.
1.) Lateral Film: Note the prominent talar beak.

2.) Oblique Film: Note the "blurred" union between the calcaneal and navicular bones. This represents the coalition.
Calcaneonavicular Coalition
Patient is a 15yo African American boy who presents with
vague pain in the foot over the talonavicular joint. The patient has pain after unusual physical activity or minor trauma, and is aggravated with continued activity.
Tarsal coalition is the union of two or more tarsal bones into a single structure. The union can be fibrous (syndesmosis), cartilaginous (synchondrosis), or osseus (synostosis). It can be congenital or acquired. Calcaneonavicular (CN) coalition is one of the most common types of tarsal coalition.
It is important to realize that the only way to properly visualize CN coalition is with an oblique projection of the foot. Tomography is usually not necessary in diagnosing CN coalition, but can be very helpful in other types of tarsal coalition. Talar beaking is non-specific, but does indicate abnormal subtalar motion.
Synostosis is relatively easy to recognize, with the area of coalition usually over 1 cm in length. Syndesmosis and synchondrosis are not as simple. However, the proximity of the two bones with 'blurring' and irregularity at their junction should heighten suspicion. An autosomal dominant transmission of CN coalition has also been shown.
The patient's symptoms usually appear in the 2nd decade of life.
