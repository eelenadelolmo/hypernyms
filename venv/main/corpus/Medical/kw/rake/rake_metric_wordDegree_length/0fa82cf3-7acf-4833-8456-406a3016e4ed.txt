Texto: 
Prolonged cranial traction (3 months) is only method that will reduce lateral mass displacement. Skeletal traction is necessary for a total of 3 months.
CORONAL CT CSPINE: Lateral translocation of right C1 articular pillar relative to C2.
AXIAL CT CSPINE: Breaks in the anterior and posterior ring of C1 with asymmetric right lateral mass displacement and disruption of the transverse atlantal ligaments.
CT HEAD: Diffuse cerebral edema with loss of gray-white matter differentiation, subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage.
Jefferson fracture
15 year old girl was assaulted and struck on the head. She presented in respiratory arrest and expired soon after her arrival to the trauma center. Brainstem injury suspected.
This patient died of her injuries. Hers was an atypical Jefferson fracture.
