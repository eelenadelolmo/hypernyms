Vitals: Temperature: 36.7 째C (98.1 째F) ,Heart Rate: 133, Respirations: 25 Blood Pressure: 62/39 mmHg O2 Sat (%): 93 %] 

Cardiovascular: Normal rate, regular rhythm, S1 normal and S2 normal. 
No murmur heard.Heart sounds louder on right compared to left side of chest 
Pulmonary/Chest: Effort normal. No nasal flaring. No respiratory distress. He has no wheezes. He exhibits no retraction. Breaths sounds decreased on right compared to left, overall decreased throughout
Treatment: Conservative medical management is sufficient in asymptomatic patients. Surgical correction is appropriate if there is evidence of significant left-to-right shunting and pulmonary hypertension. 

Follow up: Continued monitoring of pulmonary hypertension and patency of surgically corrected pulmonary venous circulation.
CT chest with IV contrast:

The IVC and the SVC are normal. The heart 
is displaced into the right hemithorax. The right ventricle is lateral 
and the left ventricle is medial and concordant consistent with 
dextroposition. The arterial supply to the right lung comes directly off of the thoracic aorta and the right pulmonary veins drain via an accessory vein into the abdominal IVC. There may also be some contribution of arterial supply to the lower portion of the right lung from the celiac artery. The right lung is much smaller than the left lung with more aberrant vascular supply but appears only mildly atelectatic. The right mainstem bronchus is smaller in comparison with the left mainstem bronchus.
Scimitar Syndrome (anomalous pulmonary systemic circulation)
Pulmonary sequestration
Congenital Heart Disease
Baby boy born at 35w by SVD to 25y G4P3 mother. Initially did well, started on NG/PO neosure feeds, but at age 2d developed oxygen desaturations and was placed in oxygen hood 30% for several hours before being weaned to RA. Echocardiogram was repeated on day 2 and 3 of life due to prenatal echo unable to visualize all 4 heart chambers well, and was found to have mild RA/RV dilation, PFO, PDA, and no visualization of RPA/RPVs with moderate pulmonary HTN noted.
