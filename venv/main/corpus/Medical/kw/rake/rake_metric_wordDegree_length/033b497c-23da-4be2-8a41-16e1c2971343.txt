Texto: 
General decreased level of consiousness
Sensitivity to light
No focal neurologic deficits
Patient was treated with three sessions of angiography with glueing of the feeding arteries.  The patient was then taken to the OR for surgical resection.
CT: left frontal mass with associated serpiginous areas of decreased density.

MRI: Mass of tangled flow voids with a large central nidus.
Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM)
findings are pathoneumonic
