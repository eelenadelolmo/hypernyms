Texto: 
Due to rupture of the syndesmosis and deltoid ligament, the mortice is unstable.  Plate and screw fixation of the fibula and syndesmotic screws are frequently needed.
- widening of medial clear space (>4mm) indicating deltoid ligament rupture
- widening of syndesmosis(>5mm) indicating rupture
- comminuted oblique fracture of fibula above the syndesmosis.
- fracture through the posterior malleolus
Pronation-external rotation injury of ankle
24 y/o African-American male had someone fall on the lateral aspect of his lower leg while playing football.
Pronation-External Rotation (PER) has 4 stages of severity.  
 
STAGE I:  A short, transverse fracture of the medial malleolus or a tear of the deltoid ligament.
STAGE II:  A tear of the anteroinferior tibiofibular ligament or a small avulsion fracture of the anterior tibia. 
STAGE III:  A tear in the interosseous membrane and a spiral fracture of the fibula above the syndesmosis.  
STAGE IV:  A fracture of the posterior tibia (malleolus).
