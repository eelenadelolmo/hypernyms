Texto: 
Significant symmetric wrist and hand deformity. No recent Rheumatoid Factor (RF) performed. ESR elevations with more acute exacerbations.
Rheumatologic medical management.
Carpo-metacarpal, hindfoot and phalangeal involvement with progressive deformity, ankylosis, joint space narrowing and gracile bones.
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, untreated, presenting as adult.
Juvenile RA
Adult-onset RA
Other inflammatory arthritides (e.g. Ankylosing Spondylitis, Psoriatic arthritis, etc.)
46 y.o. woman with juvenile-onset (early second decade) of arthritis, essentially untreated as child. Slowly progressive arthritic symptoms especially of hands and feet.
This patient had noted slowly progressive symptoms since early adolescence but was never brought for definitive care. Presenting now in her 5th decade, she already has significant involvement of her more distal appendicular skeletal joints and is a treatment dilemma at this late stage. Mainstay of treatment is to halt further progression.
