Texto: 
CT of the pelvis and abdomen with contrast: There are heterogenous masses within each kidney.  The mass on the left side measures 3.3 cm in the anteroposterior diameter.  There is a focal round hypodense area in the posterior aspect of this mass which measures 0.5 cm.  In the right kidney, there is a heterogenous mass that measures approximately 1.9 cm in anteroposterior dimension.  

There is no lymphadenopathy.  

The lung bases are clear.

The liver and spleen are normal in size and homogenous in density.  

The pancreas and adrenals are unremarkable.
Nephroblastomatosis
Renal lymphoma, renal abscess, leukemia, autosomal polycystic kidney disease
3 year old girl with multiple congenital anomalies falling into the spectrum of the CHARGE syndrome.  Bilateral renal masses were discovered as an incidental CT finding at age 12 months.
