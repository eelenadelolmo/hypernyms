Tachycardia with diminished breath sounds in the bilateral bases.
Supportive/diuretic care may be suitable for mild cases to ensure that cardiac filling is not impaired. Serious cases may require surgical stripping of the pericardium to allow for adequate filling.
A PA and lateral chest radiograph and an axial CT image through the thorax demonstrate calcification of the pericardium and bilateral pleural effusions.
Constrictive pericarditis, calcified pericardium
Although there are many causes for pleural effusions, this finding in conjunction with a calcified pericardium is highly suggestive of constrictive pericarditis.
58 year old male complaining of shortness of breath and racing heartbeat.
This patient had a benign course and did not require surgery to remove the calcified pericardium.
