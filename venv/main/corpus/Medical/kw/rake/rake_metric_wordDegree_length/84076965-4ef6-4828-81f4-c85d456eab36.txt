Treatment begins with splinting the distal interphalangeal joint in full extension for 4-5 weeks.  Surgical fixation reserved for open fractures or fractures with volar subluxation of the distal phalynx.
Dorsal lip fractures of the third and fourth distal phalanges.  The fractures are minimally displaced and extend intraarticular.  There is no volar subluxation of the distal phalanges.  The DIP joint rests in an abnormally flexed position.
Mallet Finger
