Follow up imaging is recommended in one year to demonstrate stability and lack of growth.
â€¢ There is a well circumscribed oval mass measuring 1.2 cm x 0.8 cm within the region of the pineal gland.  This follows CSF fluid signal on all sequences except for the FLAIR.
â€¢ There is a thin (<2mm) rim of peripheral enhancement after contrast
Pineal, cysts
â€¢ Pineal cyst
â€¢ Pineocytoma
21 y.l. man with a new onset of psychotic disorder.
The increased signal on FLAIR sequences likely represents some proteinaceous material in the fluid.  This patient's psychotic symptoms are unrelated to the presence of the cyst.
