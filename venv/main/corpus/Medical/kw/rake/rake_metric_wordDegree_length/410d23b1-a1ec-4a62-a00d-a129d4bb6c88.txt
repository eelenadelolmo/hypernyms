Asymptomatic; obtained screening CXR for employment; she grew up in Cappadocia (in country of Turkey) in volcanic mountainous regions.
In the Turkish region of Cappadocia, there is a very high rate of malignant mesothelioma.  Exposure to Erionite, an asbestos-like mineral found in Turkish volcanic soil, is a common cause.  The pleural plaques in Erionite exposure have the classic appearance shown in this case.
