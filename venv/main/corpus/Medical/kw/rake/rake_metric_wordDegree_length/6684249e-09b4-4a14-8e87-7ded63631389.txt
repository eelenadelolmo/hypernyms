• CT- low density changes right frontal and parietal lobes
    no evidence of hemorrhage or calcifications

• CTA- dilated vessels without mass effect indicative of a large, high flow shunt lesion

• MRI-  Confirms AVM.  Also reveals diffusion and ADC findings consistent with acute right MCA infarct.
AVM with acute right MCA infarction
• Vascular Malformation - AVM
• Cerefral Infarction
• Brain Neoplasm
46 year old woman with unremarkable medical history presents with acute onset of left-sided hemiparesis, facial palsy, and blurred vision.
It is interesting that the initial unenhanced CT scan was interpreted as acute infarction only.  Due to the lack of calcification or hemorrhage, AVM was not suspected prior to the CTA and followup MRI imaging.
