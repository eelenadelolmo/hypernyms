                                                        Labs: BUN 22 mg/dL (NML 9-20 mg/dL)
Unknown
Bilateral kidneys show normal upper and mid-pole contour.  The lower poles bilaterally are not well defined.  Transverse views show connecting renal parenchyma (isthmus) with associated isthmus vascular flow.  Also the renal cortex bilaterally is increased in echogenicity.  There is no evidence of mass or hydronephrosis.
Horseshoe kidney
Horseshoe kidney, crossed fused renal ectopia, malrotated or ectopic kidneys, gibbous deformity of the spine (resulting in altered renal axis)
20 day-old male with known history of congenital heart disease that was noted to have an elevated BUN
Horseshoe kidney is in a group of congenital kidney anomalies called fusion anomalies.  The fusion occurs at the lower poles in 90% of the cases, while 10% are fused at the upper pole.  This anomaly is found in approximately 1/500-100 people.  It is thought that the abnormal fusion likely occurs when the kidneys are still in the pelvis and the renal capsule is not fully developed.  During the kidneys ascent these fused kidneys are trapped by the inferior mesenteric artery as the isthmus is unable to pass.  The kidneys ascend to their normal positions between the fourth and ninth weeks of gestation.  Complications include: ureteropelvic junction obstruction, recurrent UTI (urine stasis and vesicoureteric reflux), recurrent stone formation, and increased risk of trauma (due to kidney positioning). Horseshoe kidney may occur as an isolated anomaly or associated with other anomalies.  Associated anomalies may include: ureteral duplication, hypospadias, undescended testis, ectopic ureter, anorectal malformations, GI malrotation, Meckel’s diverticulum, neural tube defects, clubfoot, congenital hip dislocation, and ventricular septal defect.  Chromosomal abnormalities have also been associated with horseshoe kidney.  Horseshoe kidney is often evaluated with intravenous urography, CT, and/or ultrasound. MRI and scintigraphy may also be useful.
