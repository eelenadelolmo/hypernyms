Texto: 
Focal tenderness over focal area of soft tissue swelling on left side of head.

No abnormal labwork.
No treatment.

Conservative plain film follow-up imaging at 3, 6, and 12 months.
Plain films of the skull demonstrate a lytic lesion over the left frontoparietal with beveled edges.  

Axial CT of the head demonstrates an expanding lytic lesion within the diploic space associated with destruction of both the outer and inner table of the skull.

3D-RECON of the Cranium done with thin section axial CT demonstrates the classic "hole-within-a-hole" appearance the results from uneven erosion of the inner and outer tables of the skull.

14 Year old girl presents to the pediatric clinic with painful lump in her head with no significant history of trauma.
This was a classic presentation of a skull based Langerhans cell histiocytosis.  The family chose a conservative follow-up approach as an alternative to an invasive procedure.
