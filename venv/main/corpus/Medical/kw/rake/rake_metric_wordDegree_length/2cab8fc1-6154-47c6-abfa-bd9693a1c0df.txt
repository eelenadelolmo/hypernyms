Texto: 
Neurological examination revealed lower extremity weakness, especially in the left leg.
The patient has undergone a total removal of the tumor. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course and the preoperative neurological deficits progressively improved.
Non contrast-T1-weighted and T2- weighted images reveal an extramedullary (partially intradural) mass  lesion isointense to the spinal cord at the T3 level. Post-contrast T1 -weighted images show uniform and strong enhancement of the mass lesion.
The  findings are more consistent with meningioma.
Thoracic spine meningioma (psammomatous)
Intradural-extramedullary masses:
meningioma 
neural sheath tumors (primarily Schwannomas, comprise 25-29% of spinal tumors) 
drop metastases from intracranial tumors 
metastases from non-CNS tumors (bronchogenic, breast, lymphoma, melanoma) 
hemangioblastoma 
lipoma 
dermoid 
ependymoma
39 year old woman presented with a five month history of back pain and worsening lower extremity numbness,  left side more so than right. The patient was referred to our department for Lumbar MRI scan which revealed mild degenerative disc changes with a disc protrusion at L5-S1 level mildy abutting the left proximal S1 nerve root.

Patient's symptoms were not sufficiently explained by the imaging findings of the Lumbar MRI scan , according to the radiologist supervising the exam. Thus, the radiologist decided to move forward with diagnostic work up by evaluating the thoracic spine.
Thoracic spine meningioma was the main cause of the patient's symptoms, although the small disc protrusion at L5/S1 level  could contribute to a minor degree to the clinical picture.
This case signifies the importance of correlation by the radiologist between the imaging findings and the intensity of the symptoms , so as to play an active role in the solution of the clinical problem.
