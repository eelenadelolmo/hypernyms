Normal neurological exam
Main blood supply for this tumor was a branch from the middle meningeal artery, which was endovascularly embolized with polyvinyl alcohol particles (PVA) at the time the angiogram was performed. The tumor was then resected surgically.
On MRI, there is a 6 cm extra-axial mass arising from the greater wing of the right sphenoid bone. There is hyperostosis at the attachment point of the mass to the sphenoid bone and multiple vascular flow-voids
course into the mass from the position of attachment. There is a small dural tail at the point of attachment of the mass. The mass is predominantly isointense to brain cortex on all pulse sequences and enhances densely. Mass produces significant mass-effect on adjacent right frontal lobe, right insula, right temporal lobe, and anterior right parietal lobe. An area of T2 signal is seen medial to the tumor&#39;s margins may indicate pial involvement.

On the cerebral angiogram, there is a very large hypervascular extra-axial mass that is supplied predominantly by multiple dural branches arising from the frontal branch of the right middle meningeal artery off the right ECA. However, a small area of tumor blush is demonstrated on the angiogram of the right ICA. This is because the tumor has acquired additional blood supply from MCA branches which are pial arteries and additional venous drainage to cortical (pial) veins by invading the pia. Delayed angiogram images also demonstrate classic "mother-in-law" effect of contrast coming early and staying late.
Meningioma with pial invasion
Dural Based Mass:

 • Hemangiopericytoma
 • Dural metastasis (in a woman, breast cancer)
 • Sarcoid and other granulomatous disease

Meningiomas are the most common extra-axial neoplasm in the brain. Patients are most commonly middle-aged and female more often than male. 90% are supratentorial and occur most often along the parasagittal dura, convexities, sphenoid wing and cerebellopontine angle. 

On CT, the majority are slightly hyperdense. On MRI, they are most often isointense on T1 and T2 sequences, but may be slightly hypointense on T1 or slightly hyperintense on T2. Vascular flow voids can be present within or around these masses. Up to 70% of cases have a dural tail seen at the edges of the lesion. Meningiomas also uniformly enhance after contrast administration. Associated edema in the adjacent brain can be seen. Changes in adjacent bone can be seen, including hyperostosis or osteolysis. 

Angiography is rarely performed for diagnosis of meningioma, but rather is peformed as part of a preoperative endovascular embolization procedure. At angiography, a tumor blush is seen. Classically meningiomas enhance early in the arterial phase of the angiogram and enhancement remains in the late venous phase. Often the middle meningeal artery is enlarged, particularly if the tumor is located along a convexity or the sphenoid wings. Preoperative endovascular embolization can be performed to decrease intraoperative blood loss. 

Meningiomas are usually WHO grade I tumors. However other subtypes include atypical meningiomas (2.4% of meningiomas) which are WHO grade II, and malignant meningiomas (rare) which are WHO grade III.
