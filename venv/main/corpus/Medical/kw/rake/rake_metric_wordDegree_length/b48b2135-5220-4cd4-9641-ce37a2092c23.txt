1) Axial T1 Flair, post contrast, demonstrates a fusiform enhancing mass extending into the dorsal midbrain and interpenduncular cistern measuring 10 x 16 x 6 mm
2) Sagittal T1 Flair, post contrast, demonstrating a mass measuring 10 x 16 x 6 mm near the right third cranial nerve
3) Two month follow up, Axial T1 IDEAL 3 mm, tumor now measuring 27 x 22 x 20
4) Two month follow up, Sagittal T1 Flair with contrast, tumor now measuring 27 x 22 x 20

Patient is a 21-month-old female, with no significant medical history, referred by her primary care physician for worsening right eye redness and droopy eyelid.  Two weeks prior to presentation, the patient’s mother brought her to the primary care physician, after she had noticed tearing of the right eye and drooping of the right eyelid.  She was treated for conjunctivitis, but then returned ten days later due to worsening of the redness and tearing.  The patient was then referred to the ophthalmologist, who noted a right CN III palsy.
