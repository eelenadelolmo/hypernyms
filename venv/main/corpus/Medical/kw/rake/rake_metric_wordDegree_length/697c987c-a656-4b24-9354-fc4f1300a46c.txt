Well-appearing young woman.  No laboratory data.
Patient was referred to the GI service for upper endoscopy to further evaluate her symptoms and to correlate with the radiographic findings.
The two lateral flouroscopic images obtained during a barium swallow examination demonstrate a dilated esophagus with an air-barium level, which progressively increased as the patient continued to drink barium.  Also seen is a smooth tapered narrowing at the lower esophageal sphincter, termed a "bird's beak" appearance.  Real-time flouroscopy demonstrated a lack of esophageal peristalsis with failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax.

Scleroderma with acquired esophageal stricture.

27-year old active duty female with several month history of reflux symptoms.  Patient has no past medical history other than current complaint of GERD.  Patient has been treated for the last 6-months with a proton pump inhibitor with little relief of her symptoms.  Patient states that she occasional regurgitates undigested food.  Her symproms are worse at night, but she denies eating for at least two-hours prior to lying down.
Real-time flouroscopy demonstrated a lack of primary peristalsis throughout the barium swallow examination.  The lower esophageal sphincter also failed to relax until the pressure of the column of barium theoretically exceeded the pressure of the LES.  A barium pill was also administered during the exam, which failed to pass for several hours.  The pill finally passed after having the patient drink copious amounts of water.
