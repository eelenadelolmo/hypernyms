Tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen with positive pregnancy test.
Treatment for ectopic pregnancy requires termination of the pregnancy by either surgical removal or medical treatment with an agent such as methrotrexate. Follow up is accomplished by obtaining HcG levels to ensure that they are decreasing as well as by repeat ultrasonographic examination.
Ultrasonographic images of the uterus and adnexa demonstrating the lack of a intrauterine gestational sac and the presence of a tubular structure in the right adnexa.
Ectopic pregnancy.
