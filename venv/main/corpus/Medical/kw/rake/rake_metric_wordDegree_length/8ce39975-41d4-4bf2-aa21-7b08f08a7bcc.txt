Given the initial blood pressures, proteinuria, and LVH, the patient was started on Captopril at 1-month of age. His blood pressure continued to increase over the next month and his medication regimen was escalated accordingly to include Captopril, Aldactazide, and Inderal. From the age of 2 months to 7-months he was continued on his 3 medication regimen. 

Angiography was completed at 7-months of age. It was noted at the time of admission for the procedure that his blood pressure had declined significantly and his Aldactazide and Inderal were discontinued upon discharge. 

At present, the patient is 9-months old and continues to have well-controlled blood pressures on the Captopril alone. His LVH is resolving, and he no longer has proteinuria. The DMSA scan showed no uptake in the right kidney suggesting auto-infarction.
1. Renal Ultrasound at 26 days-old:
Both kidneys were 5.3cm in length. There was no evidence of a renal mass on either kidney. Pelvocaliceal systems and ureters were normal without hydronephrosis or hydroureter. The abdominal aorta, IVC, and iliac arteries appeared normal. The bladder was normal.

2. 2D- Echocardiogram at 26 days-old:
Mild, concentric LVH but otherwise normal.

3. Digital Subtraction Angiogram (Aortogram) at the age of 7 months:
The abdominal aorta has a normal appearance. A single left renal artery is present at the L1-L2 level. The left main renal artery has a smooth appearance without beading or narrowing. The segmental, subsegmental, and arcuate arteries appear normal on the left. A small fetal lobule is present at the lower pole of the left kidney. Left renal vein flow is demonstrated to the IVC. There appears to be compensatory hypertrophy of the left kidney.

A single right renal artery is demonstrated from the aorta. The proximal right renal artery is quite narrow, with an additional focal narrowing present 1cm distal to the origin of the right renal artery. Mild poststenotic dilatation of the distal right renal artery is present. Delayed contrast flow is demonstrated through a small right kidney. The right subsegmental arteries are tortuous and irregular in appearance throughout the small right kidney.

4. Renal Ultrasound at 8-months-old (post-angiogram):
The right kidney is small and measures 4.3cm in length compared to the left kidney which measures 6.9 cm in length. On the previous ultrasound, both kidneys measured 5.3cm in length. The collecting systems and ureters are normal bilaterally. Renal cortical echogenicity is normal bilaterally. No renal masses are seen. The parenchyma of the right kidney is thinned compared to the previous exam.

5. DMSO Renography at 8.5 months-old:
Nuclear medicine renography shows no uptake in the right kidney.
Congenital renal artery stenosis of the right kidney of uncertain etiology.
1. Fibromuscular dysplasia of the right renal artery
2. Congenital renal artery stenosis
3. Congenital right renal hypoplasia
A 26 day-old, Caucasian male with a history of GERD is admitted for failure to thrive. On admission history and physical exam he was noted to have hypertension.

Birth History: On admission, he was a 26 day-old, Caucasian male. Mom was G3 P3 and her pregnancy was complicated by preterm labor at 5 months, with the remainder of the pregnancy being uncomplicated. She was on bed rest for the last month of the pregnancy, but was able to carry the baby to term and had an uncomplicated SVD at 40 weeks. Mom received routine prenatal care throughout the pregnancy including 2 ultrasounds that were normal. She denied any history of smoking, drugs, or medications during her pregnancy. The patient was a full term infant with a birth weight of 7lbs 1 oz. He was discharged from the hospital on day #2 of life at the same weight. 

He was 6lbs 9 oz at his one-week check-up and had developed issues with vomiting/GERD. As a result, his formula was changed and he was started on Zantac. However, the vomiting persisted, his continued to lose weight and was noted to tire with feeding- so he was admitted at 26 days-old for evaluation of failure to thrive.

PMH:
1. GERD
2. Failure to thrive

Surgical Hx: None.

Family Hx: 
Dad: Childhood murmur that resolved
Mom: Healthy
Maternal Grandfather: HTN diagnosed as an adult
There is no FH of renal disease, dialysis requirement, HTN in childhood, congenital heart disease, or genetic diseases.
The patient has 1 and 3 year-old siblings that are healthy.

Medications:
- Zantac on admission.

Allergies: NKDA
This patient’s presentation, age, and initial lab evaluation all suggested secondary hypertension- most likely reno-vascular in nature. Statistically, fibromuscular dysplasia would be the most likely etiology, but the precise etiology in this patient is unknown at this time.

This case illustrates the importance of addressing elevated blood pressures in the pediatric population as most hypertension in the pediatric population is secondary hypertension, and therefore, potentially treatable
