None. Incidental finding in this case.
Lateral ankle radiograph demonstrates a well defined round low density lesion with thin sclerotic border in the neck of the calcaneus.  Centrally is a region of ossification.
MRI without contrast shows a round fat signal intensity mass (high signal T1 and low signal on T2 fat-suppressed) in the neck of the calcaneus with a central region partially ossified with a small fluid component.
Intraosseous Lipoma
None
41 y/o male with increasing left ankle pain for several months and significant weight loss from biking and walking.
