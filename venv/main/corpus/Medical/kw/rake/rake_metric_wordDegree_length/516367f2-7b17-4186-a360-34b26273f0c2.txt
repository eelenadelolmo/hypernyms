Texto: 
No focal neurological deficit.  No abnormal labs.
Surgical excision.
â€¢ CT:  Hyperdense round area adjacent to posterior falx on right.  On bone window settings, some calcifications are seen within the mass.  
â€¢ MR:  Avid enhancement of extraxial mass.  On T2 images there is a CSF cleft sign, suggesting extraxial location aas well as compression of sulci.  A dural tail is also seen.
â€¢ MRV:  No venous or sinus occlusion.
Meningioma
â€¢ Meningioma
â€¢ Dural sarcoid
â€¢ Dural metastasis
â€¢ Hemangiopericytoma

Being extra-axial, with avid enhancement, including a dural tail and associated calcification - Meningioma is most likely.
52 year-old woman with headaches and some dizziness.
