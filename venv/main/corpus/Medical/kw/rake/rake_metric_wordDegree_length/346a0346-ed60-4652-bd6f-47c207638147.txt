Meningioma, WHO grade 2 (Chordoid)
63 yo RHD woman who presented for evaluation of cerebral tumor.  History started around 1 year ago with generalized &#39;slowing&#39;.  She frequently complained of &#39;not feeling well&#39; several times per week this past year which progressively worsened.  Her son noted personality changes over the past 4-5 months where she would not be motivated to move, interact with others.  She often said &#39;can we do it later&#39;.  Approx 2 months ago, she was found sitting in her care, at work, which was thought to be for several hours.  She was confused and disoriented.
