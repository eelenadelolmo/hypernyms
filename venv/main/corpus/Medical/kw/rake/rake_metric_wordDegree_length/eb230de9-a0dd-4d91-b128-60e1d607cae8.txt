Physical examination reveals a healthy appearing male in no distress. AOX3. 
Head: Normocephalic, atraumatic. 
Eyes: Pupils are equally round, reactive to light. Extraocular muscles are intact. 
Ears: External auditory canals are clear bilaterally. Tympanic membranes are intact. 
Nasal cavity: patent and clear on an anterior rhinoscopy. Oral cavity: Oropharynx reveals a large mass in the right peritonsillar region. This mass is pushing the uvula across the midline to the left. The tongue appears midline and is mobile to both sides symmetrically. There are no oral cavity or oropharyngeal masses. 
Neck: There is a tip of a mass palpated in level 2 on the right. There are no other neck masses palpated. The shoulder shrug reveals intact cranial nerve XI.
Surgical removal of mass.
There is a very large mass lesion within the right parapharyngeal region, extending to the skull base and down to the level of the oropharynx. This mass is well circumscribed, and displaces muscle anteriorly and vascular structures posteriorly.

21-year-old Hmong male presented to the ER with a 3 to 4 month history of right oropharyngeal swelling and pain.
21-year-old Hmong male who presented with a 3 to 4 month history of right oropharyngeal swelling and pain. He has been on and off antibiotics for the past 3 months with suspected tonsillitis infections, yet his condition has progressed. His swelling continued and he was seen in the Emergency Room where an incision and drainage of this area was attempted. This incision and drainage did not yield any exudate so a CT scan and subsequent MRI scan were obtained and are suspicious for tumor. He denies any excessive sweating at night. No fevers, no other constitutional symptoms. He has been able to tolerate a diet without any difficulty except for the fact that he does have some discomfort in the back of his throat. The quality of his voice has not changed and it has been strong. He has had no facial weakness or facial numbness. FNA biopsy demonstrated pleomorphic adenoma and subsequent surgical intervention removed the mass.
