Texto: 
Irregularly shaped head with prominant l frontal calvarium.
Pt. undergoing pre-op evaluation for surgical correction.
See Captions.

Saggital suture is displaced laterally and obliquely angled.  The labdoid suture is displaced left posteriorly.  The right coronal suture is fused.
There is a white matter cleft in the right frontal lobe c/w schizencephaly.
Unilateral Coronal Synostosis
Helical CT with 3-D reconstructions.
Cranial Synostosis - isolated
Cranial Synostosis - syndromic
Moulding.
5 y/o former 24 wk prematue infant with 5 mo NICU with multiple medical problems including history of IVH, CP, MR, congenital cardiac defects including PDA and ASD, and 47 XXY.  Patient's twin was stillborn. Patient presents with recent history of siezures and a progressively oddly shaped head.
This patient has multiple medical and genetic problems, but his cranial deformity is likely an isolated abnormality perhaps from prematurity and/or function of being a twin.  Craniosynostosis is not noted in the literature as being associated with XXY genotypes.
