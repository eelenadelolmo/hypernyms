Physical Exam and Laboratory: 
Pertinent Physical Findings:  Abdomen--distended, non-tender, ascites present, no organomegaly detected.  Exam otherwise benign.
Lab Findings:  Chem7â€”141/5.0/105/31/12/0.6/112; CBCâ€”8.7/11.0/34.0/181; Coag PT 12.8/PTT 27.8; 
LFTsâ€”AlkPhos 1052/AST 233/ ALT 91/ Tbili 2.7 
Tumor markers: CA 27-29 1371 (normal 0-37), CA 15-3 1464 (normal 0-31), CA 125 196 (normal 0-34), AFP normal
Histology of Breast Bx: Infiltrating Ductal CA T3N2M2
Histology of Liver Bx:  Adenocarcinoma; Special stains include cytokeratin 7: positive, cytokeratin 20: negative, progesterone/estrogen: positive, CEA: focally positive, Thyroid transcription factor 1: negative.
Treatment and Follow-up: 
Plan to have pt follow-up with pulmonology for assessment of lung function and work-up of lung nodules.  Also, pt to have colonoscopy.  Consult general surgery placed for evaluation of left breast mass. This patient insisted that she be discharged after the diagnostic imaging took place to attend an important family event.  Thus, she was discharged on hospital day six, with the aforementioned follow-up appointments made.
Image Findings: 
1.	PET scanâ€”2 hypermetabolic foci in Left breast; Focal hypermetabolic uptake in inferior Right liver lobe and Left liver lobe with diffuse/heterogeneous uptake in Right lobe; diffuse bone uptake in axial/appendicular skeleton that is nonspecific:  malignant vs liver failure.
2.	MRCP/MRI abdomenâ€”liver cirrhosis and portal HTN leading to splenomegaly and ascites; no pancreatic ductal dilatation; liver lesions are peripheral with capsular retraction
3.	CT chestâ€”too numerous to count non-calcified nodules in lungs; Left breast lesion and axillary lymph node
4.	Breast U/S (image not available for MedPix) used for core Bxâ€”1.2cm lesion in Left upper outer breast; BIRADS category 5
Diagnosis:  64 y.o. female with recurrent breast cancer with metastasis to lymph nodes and lungs.  Liver mass biopsy reveals adenocarcinoma, with histology consistent with breast tissue.
Differential Diagnosis for these findings in this case:
1.	Liver lesions and ascites:  Periportal fibrosis, cirrhosis leading to HCC, regenerating nodules, inflammation, neoplastic infiltration in interstitium
2.	Lung nodules:  metastasis, infectious, granulomatous, TB, mycobacterial
3.	Breast lesions:  primary lesion, metastasis
History (can include gestational age, or age in days, weeks, months):
64 y.o. WF with hx of Breast CA (1996), s/p lumpectomy and XRT, admitted for workup of fatigue, 15-20 lb weight loss in 8 months, and increased abdominal girth in the setting of imaging studies, which show ascites (with peritoneal fluid negative for malignant cells), liver lesions, and multiple lung masses.  Prior workup demonstrated elevated LFTs, Elevated CEA, CA 19-9, CA 125, and negative viral hepatitis panels.
Discussion (include references): 
The lung nodules are likely adenocarcinoma, which is the most common type of lung cancer in most recently reported series, and is the most frequent histologic type in women and nonsmokers of either sex.   This patient has a 40 pack year hx of smoking.  Metastasis is the most common neoplasm in an adult liver, and the liver is the second most common site for metastatic spread, after the lymph nodes.  The patient also has recurrent breast cancer.  Infiltrating ductal carcinoma is the most common type of invasive breast cancer, accounting for 70 to 80 percent of invasive lesions.   The final pathology report indicates that the liver mass is adenocarcinoma, with the special stains being consistent with breast tissue.  The TTF1 stain is 70-80% specific for lung metastasis, and it is negative in this case.  The recurrent breast cancer stage is T3N2M2 with metastasis to the liver and presumably lung.
