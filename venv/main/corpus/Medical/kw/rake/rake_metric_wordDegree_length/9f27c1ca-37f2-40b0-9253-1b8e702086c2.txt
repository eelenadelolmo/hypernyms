Both wrists demonstrate narrowed radioscaphoid joint space, widening of the scapholunate joint space with degenerative changes and debris, and proximal migration of the capitate, consistent with scapholunate advanced collapse.  The bilateral osteoarthritis of the radioscaphoid joints and faint calcification at the region of the triangular fibrocartilage at the left wrist are all characteristic of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease.
scapholunate advanced collapse
scapholunate advanced collapse
74 year-old man with bilateral wrist pain.
SLAC (scapholunate advanced collapse) wrist deformity occurs in the setting of chronic scapholunate ligamentous disruption. Trauma, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease and rheumatoid arthritis are common causes of scapholunate ligament disruption.
