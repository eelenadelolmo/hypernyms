Regular prophylactic antibiotics and regular f/u with pediatric urology
U/S:
-R kidney: demonstrating normal echogenicity and measuring 9.5cm (upper limit of normal for patient age.) There is no evidence of hydronephrosis
-L kidney: elongated measuring 11.5cm. There is evidence of mild hyperechogenecity of the renal cortex.

VCUG: Grade II reflux on the right. Grade IV reflux on the left with mild tortuosity of the ureter. Additionally, there are compound calyces of the superior and inferior poles of the left collecting system. Normal urethra without evidence of posterior urethral valves (PUV).
Vesicoureteral Reflux
Previously healthy 4yo male with a recent history of decreased appetite and approximately 5lb weight loss x 2.5wks, intermittent vomiting and diarrhea x 2wks, and dysuria x 2d presents with fever to 104, mild tachycardia, and CVAT L>R. Initial lab work-up reveals increased WBC and the presence of urine nitrites and leukocyte esterase.
Definition: Vesioureteral Reflux (VUR) describes a process in which there is retrograde passage of urine from the bladder into the upper urinary tract. VUR can be divided into two categories - primary and secondary. Primary VUR is caused by a congenital anomaly of the ureterovesical junction (UVJ) such as a shortened intravesical ureter or an ectopic ureteral opening in the bladder trigone. Secondary VUR is caused by increased intravesical pressure most likely caused by obstruction. Obstruction could be anatomic (such as in posterior urethral valves) or functional (such as voiding or bladder abnormalities) 

Epidemiology: VUR is found in 1% of newborns and is the most common urologic anomaly found in newborns. VUR is also present in 30-45% in young children presenting with a febrile UTI. Factors that increase the risk for VUR are race (Caucasian: African American = 3:1), gender (F:M = 2:1), and age (increased risk for younger children and infants) 

Diagnosis: The definitive diagnosis can only be made by demonstrating reflux of urine from the bladder to the collecting system via VCUG or radionuclide cystogram. 

Clinical: VUR is characteristically discovered during evaluation for childhood UTI. Appox 50% of the cases are bilateral at time of discovery. 
The International Reflux Study Group has established a standardized grading system to describe the severity of VUR based on VCUG results. 

Grade I: Ureteral involvement w/o dilation 
Grade II: Ureteral and collecting system involvement w/o dilation 
Grade III. Mild ureteral and collecting system dilation w/ mild 
calyceal blunting 
Grade IV: Grossly dilated ureter and collecting system w/ 
moderate calyceal blunting. 
Grade V: Massively dilated and tortuous ureter and collecting 
system. Papillary impression no longer visible in 
most calyces. 

Despite a high grade of reflux, 60% of grades III-V reflux will spontaneously resolve by age 4. 

Treatment: Initial medical treatment consists of long-term prophylactic antibiotic therapy to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections and reduce the incidence of long-term complications secondary to repeated infections and longstanding reflux. 
Surgical treatment should be considered when there are repeated infections despite prophylactic antibiotics, presence of a ureterocele, presence of urinary tract obstruction, or if reflux does not resolve past the age of 4-5yo. Currently, there are two surgical options - open surgical reimplantation of the ureters into the bladder or endoscopic injection of copolymer beneath the UVJ mucosa. 

Long-term complications include chronic pyelonephritis and renal scarring secondary to recurrent infections, hypertension, proteinuria, decreased renal function, and ESRD.
