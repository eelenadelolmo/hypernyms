Double-contrast UGI reveals a small outpouching from the mid-esophagus.  This outpouching is noted to be smoothly marginated when present, to fill with air or contrast, then subsequently collapse.
Traction Esophageal Diverticulum
Esophageal diverticulum - traction vs. pulsion
57 yo Asian woman with the occasional feeling of food getting caught in esophagus.  Symptoms are intermittent and do not depend on the type of food.  She denies weight gain or weight loss or pain.
Witnessing the expansion and contraction of the diverticulum confirms traction as the subtype.
