Texto: 
Significant for absent breath sounds at right base.
Tube thoracostomy with chemical pleurodesis.  Consider lung transplantation.
CXR:  Dilated, cystic air spaces.   Large pneumothorax at base of left lung.

HRCT:  Diffuse, small, thin-walled cysts throughout both lung fields.  Pneumothorax at anterior right lung base.
Spontaneous pneumothorax secondary to pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis
Pneumothorax from other causes, especially bullous disease, atypical infection, trauma.
41 year old caucasian woman presents with worsening dyspnea and chest pain.
Pulmonary LAM is a rare lung disease affecting women of reproductive age.  The main feature of the disease is proliferation of pulmonary interstitial smooth muscle cells.  Patients typically present with dyspnea, and may also have cough and chest pain.  Median survival is 8 to 10 years from diagnosis although patients may benefit from hormonal therapy, oophorectomy, and lung transplantation.  Complications of LAM include spontaneous pneumothorax, chylothorax, chyloperitoneum, chyluria, renal angiomyolipomas, hemoptysis, and meningioma.
