There is chondrocalcinosis present within the triangular fibrocartilage, hyaline cartilage of the distal radius, and in the lunotriquetral ligament.  There are degenerative changes in the trapezioscaphoid and, to a lesser degree, radiocarpal joint. Some degenerative change is also noted in the third CMC joint as well. No erosions are seen.

Hemachomatosis
History of gout with severe wrist pain for 1 week
This patient has a history of gout which may have been a clinical diagnosis.  However, in light of the findings of chondrocalcinosis and degenerative changes of joints that are uncommon sites for OA but typical for pyrophosphate arthropathy, this patient most likely has CPPD arthropathy with pseudogout. While CPPD has an association with concommitant hemochromatosis or hyperparathyroidism, either of which may produce a similar arthropathy, there is no clinical indication to support their presence.
