Apneic with poor tone and poor color at birth.
Decreased peak flow and positive end expiratory pressure settings on the ventilator allowed the pulmonary interstitial emphysema to resolve without complications.  Patients with Respiratory Distress Syndrome often need high oxygen concentrations delivered at high pressures for long periods of time.  In some children, this treatment damages the lung parenchyma and results in a condition known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
Image 1:  The earliest radiograph after birth demonstrates low lung volumes with a hazy granular pattern and air bronchograms.  A faint increase in radiolucency is seen over the left lung.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal in shape and caliber.  An OG tube is seen terminating in the esophagus.

Image 2: The chest radiograph on the third day of life shows an endotracheal tube present with an OG tube terminating in the stomach.  Linear and cystic lucencies are seen within the left lung that extend all the way to the periphery.  These bubbles of interstitial air are classic findings in pulmonary interstitial pneumonia.
 
Image 3: The chest radiograph on the fourth day of life demonstrates resolution of the interstitial air but continued hazy granular opacities within both lungs associated with air bronchograms and decreased lung volumes.  The endotracheal tube has been removed, and the OG tube has been advanced into the stomach.
Pulmonary Interstitial Emphysema (PIE)
Pneumonia
Lymphangiectasia
Retained fetal fluid
Meconium Aspiration
Pulmonary edema (think about a patent ductus arteriosus, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, and transposition of the great vessels as possible causes of edema)
This case involves a 3 day old male who was born at 31 weeks and 4 days gestation, by spontaneous vaginal delivery.  The patient required positive pressure ventilation at birth and was immediately transferred to the NICU where he required intubation and mechanical ventilation.
This patient developed pulmonary interstitial emphysema as a result of being intubated and requiring positive pressure-assisted ventilation.  As a result of lung immaturity, there was a lack of surfactant.  The lack of surfactant caused the alveoli of the lungs to remain collapsed.  The granular pattern in the X-rays represents generalized alveolar collapse with various distended alveolar ducts and terminal bronchioles which are seen as air bronchograms.

As time went on, the terminal bronchioles and alveolar ducts became more over distended and were seen as small bubbles on the X-ray.  With simple RDS, these bubbles disappear on expiration; however, in pulmonary interstitial emphysema the bubbles of air persist.  The emphysema develops as a consequence of the stiff, noncompliant lungs.

Pulmonary interstitial emphysema occurred in this child after he was intubated.  In many RDS patients, the assisted ventilation improves oxygenation; however, in some the elevated pressures result in air leakage from the terminal bronchioles and alveolar ducts into the interstitium and lymphatics.  This leakage of air results in linear (sometimes serpentine) and cystic bubbles extending to the periphery of the lung. 

Complications from pulmonary interstitial emphysema include pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium (may lead to cardiac tamponade), pneumothorax, and air embolism.  These complications can be fatal which illustrates the importance of identifying pulmonary interstitial emphysema early and the need to correct it as soon as possible.
