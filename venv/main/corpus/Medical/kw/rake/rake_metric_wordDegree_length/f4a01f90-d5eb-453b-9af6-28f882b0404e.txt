Afebrile and normotensive.  No tachycardia or tachypnea.  White blood cell count within normal limits.
Symptomatic treatment.
The PA and lateral chest radiograph of the chest demonstrates clear lungs without focal consolidation, mass, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours and pulmonary vasculature are within normal limits.  There are central vertebral body endplate depressions (concavities) throughout the thoracic spine resulting in an “H-shape” or “Lincoln-log” appearance of the vertebral bodies on the lateral view.
