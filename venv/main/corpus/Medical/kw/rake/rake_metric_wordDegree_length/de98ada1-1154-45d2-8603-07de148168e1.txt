The patient first underwent EGD for biopsy and then underwent surgical resection of the mass.  The patient expired approximately nine months after detection of the cancer.
Axial CT images through the lower thorax and upper abdomen following the administration of oral and IV contrast material demonstrate a segment of significant circumferential wall thickening and lumenal narrowing involving the distal third of the esophagus and the proximal aspect of the stomach. There is associated lymphadenopathy.

PET/CT fusion images in axial, sagital and coronal planes deomstrate focal increased FDG-18 metabolism in the region of wall thickening identified on the CT scan with a maximum SUV of 11.6.
Adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction
Adenocarcinoma in a Barrett esophagus
Gastric Adenocarcinoma with extension into the distal esophagus
Metastatic disease
