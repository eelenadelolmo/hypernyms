Texto: 
bilateral papilledema, left greater than right
Multiple axial MR images demonstrate enlarged optic nerves bilaterally, with stranding of intraconal fat, with avid enhancement of the optic nerves and the surrounding intraconal fat bilaterally on the post-contrast T1-weighted images with fat-suppression, without fusiform enlargement of the nerves or tram-track-like enhancement seen in optic glioma or optic nerve meningioma, respectively.  

MR images of the brain (not shown) demonstrated no other abnormalities.
optic neuritis
optic neuritis, bilateral:
- multiple sclerosis (initial presentation)
- acute disseminated encephalomyelitis
- orbital pseudotumor
49 y.o. white man who had an acute onset of bilateral decreased visual acuity.
For this particular patient, his male gender, the fact that the MRI of the brain yielded no other lesions typical for MS, and the bilateral nature of the optic neuritis, all suggest ADEM (or Devic Disease, NMO) as possible etiology for his disease.
