PHYSICAL EXAM:	Physical examination revealed a healthy appearing female in no apparent distress. Examination of the lower legs revealed large, discrete, irregularly shaped yellow to erythematous plaques on the anterior and medial aspect of both lower legs. The plaques were markedly indurated and covered with numerous prominent telangiectasias. There was a small area of necrosis with focal ulceration on the inferior aspect of the lesion on the left leg. There was no palpable regional lymphadenopathy.
An incisional biopsy was performed revealing numerous microcystic spaces in the deep dermis and subcutaneous fat with foreign body granulomatous reaction, foamy histiocytic infiltration, stromal hyalinization, and microcalcification with overlying ulceration consistent with silicone granulomata.

The patient subsequently underwent excision of the entire lesion on the left lower leg with placement of a myocutaneous free-flap composed of latissimus dorsi and split-thickness skin grafts. She tolerated the procedure well and is recovering nicely.
SILICONE GRANULOMA (1997 Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, Case#6) presented by: LCDR William F. Smith, MC, USNR
The patient underwent silicone injections of both lower legs in the early 1960's. Approximately twenty years later she noted progressive scaling and erythema in the injected area, and subsequently developed firm, slowly enlarging plaques on the anterior and medial aspect of both lower legs. She also reported pain of the left lower extremity with ambulation. PMHX: Significant for hypertension, for which she takes Zestril 20 mg per day. She has smoked 1-2 ppd of cigarettes for greater than 30 years.
