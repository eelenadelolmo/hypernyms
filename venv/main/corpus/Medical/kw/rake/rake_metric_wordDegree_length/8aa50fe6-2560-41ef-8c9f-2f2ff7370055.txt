Normal scrotal examination
No treatment necessary.
Some institutions might follow-up initially after a few months and then discontinue if no change is demonstrated.
Multiple simple-appearing cystic lesions within the testicles near the region of the medistinum testis.
Intratesticular Cysts (based on imaging characteristics)
Intratesticular cysts
Ectasia of the rete testis
Cystic malignancy
   Teratoma
   Mixed germ cell tumor
Testicular cysts noted on previous ultrasound.
Some believe that intratesticular cysts may belong to the same pathophysiologic continuum as ectasia of the rete testis.
