Due to the slow-growing nature of these tumors, the relative lack of neurologic symptoms and the age of the patient, close follow up with serial CT or MRI looking for interval size change would likely represent the most appropriate management for this patient. (MRI produces exquisite detail of the spinal cord. Most tumors are isointense or slightly hypointense compared to the normal cord signal. Contrast-enhanced MRI is very sensitive for tumors and may disclose minute lesions). This patient should be followed by neurology on a routine basis.  Any new onset in local or radiating pain, progressive weakness in the arms or legs, loss of balance and impaired bowel or bladder function should initiate a complete neurologic workup. Examination may reveal a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs. Lower motor signs may be at the level of the lesion and may aid in localization.  Other signs upon physical examination may include spine tenderness, stiffening of gait, trophic changes of extremities or sensory loss.  If the patient becomes symptomatic the benefits of surgical removal of the tumor(s) should be weighed against the intrinsic risk of surgery in this patient. Absolute contraindications to surgical intervention include uncorrected coagulopathy and systemic infection. Relative contraindications to surgical intervention include complete neurologic deficit over 24 hours and short life expectancy (which should be considered in this patient).  Additionally, although tumors that give rise to symptoms or those that become malignant are generally excised, if the tumor is on a vital nerve, excision may be impossible . Radiation therapy prior to surgery may be of benefit. 
No laboratory tests are specific or sensitive to tumors arising from the spinal cord. Genetic testing may benefit patientâ€™s children.
CXR-  Normal aeration of the lungs. Multiple sub cm nodular opacities throughout the lungs which correspond to pleural-based nodules on CT.  There is a 3.7 x 3.0 cm right paraspinal mass adjacent to the T3-4 vertebral body.  No focal airspace consolidation,  pneumothorax or effusion.  The cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vessels are within normal limits. The aorta is ecstatic, with atherosclerotic calcification. Hiatal hernia noted. Senescent changes are noted in the thoracolumbar spine and bilateral AC joints. 

CT Chest W/O Contrast-  Significant amount of calcification involving the coronary vessels, aorta, and splenic artery. The heart, great vessels, esophagus, large airways and other mediastinal structures are otherwise unremarkable.  Small mediastinal lymph nodes are seen which are thought to be within normal limits.  Of note, there are multiple sub-clinical axillary nodes present  along with a single 1.2cm right axillary lymph node which is at the upper limits of normal.  There is a  2.4 x 3.4 cm soft tissue density mass-like lesion seen in the right paraspinous space with apparent extension into the T3-4 intervertebral neural foramina. There is also a 1cm soft tissue nodule seen at the T11-12 paraspinous space on the right side (not seen in the CT slice provided).
Neurofibroma, likely neurofibromatosis type I.
Neurofibroma vs. Schwannoma vs. Meningioma vs. Sarcoma (bone, cartilage, muscle) vs. Glioma (Ependymoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma) vs. vertebral/spinal cord metastases of  Breast, Lung Cancer or recurrent lymphoma (MALToma).
80 year old female with history of low grade lymphoma (ocular MALToma) and meningioma admitted for Left inguinal hernia repair. Found to have abnormal mass on CXR during  pre-op evaluation.
Spinal tumors can be divided into extradural, intradural extramedullary, and intradural intramedullary. (each subset is briefly described below). The location of the soft tissue mass-like lesion in this patient is representative of an intradural-extramedullary tumor (ie. neurofibroma, meningioma or schwannoma).
