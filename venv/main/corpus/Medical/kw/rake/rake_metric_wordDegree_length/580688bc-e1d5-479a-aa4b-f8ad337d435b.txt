Patient will be referred for surgical removal.
Immediate Tc 99m â€“sestamibi image reveals focal hyperintensity in the right inferior region of the thyroid bed.  No thyroid uptake is seen in the expected anatomic location of the thyroid gland.  Remaining soft tissue uptake is normal.  Delayed images (not shown) revealed same "hot spot" in lower right neck and decreased uptake in the surrounding soft tissue as expected for a delayed image.
Parathyroid adenoma in setting of small lingual thyroid
-Parathyroid adenoma and absence of thyroid tissue (e.g. post-surgical/treatment, congenital)
-Single focus of thyroid tissue
-Parathyroid tissue and ectopic thyroid tissue (not visualized)
66 year old female with primary hyperparathyroidism.
Upon further discussion with the patient, she revealed that she has a lingual thyroid and has been taking Synthroid for years.  Furthermore, she was told that she has no thyroid tissue in her neck.
