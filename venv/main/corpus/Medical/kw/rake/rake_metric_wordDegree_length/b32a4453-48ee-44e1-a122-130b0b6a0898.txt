The sagittal T1W image show the absence of the normal posterior pituitary bright spot within the sella turcica.  The sella and the anterior pituitary are small.  An area of high signal is seen within a truncated pituitary stalk representing an ectopic posterior pituitary gland.   The abnormal location of the posterior pituitary is also seen on the T1W coronal image.

Following the administration of intravenous gadolinium, there is normal enhancement of the gland and stalk.
