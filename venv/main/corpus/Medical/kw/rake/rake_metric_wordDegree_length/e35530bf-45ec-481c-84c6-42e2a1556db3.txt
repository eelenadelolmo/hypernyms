Surgical resection of lesion for seizure control and prevention of symptomatic hemorrhage.
Complex lesion with cystic and solid components in the left frontal lobe.  Complex pattern of high and low signal intensity suggest either melanin or blood products within the lesion.  Little or no mass effect nor edema suggest a long standing process.  No large vascular structures are present on MRA.
Cerebral Cavernous Malformation ("hemangioma")
Vascular malformation - AVM
Neoplasm - Astrocytoma
Neoplasm - Glioblastoma
Metastatic lesion (e.g. colon cancer)
Hemorrhagic metastatic lesion
Primary or Metastatic melanoma
