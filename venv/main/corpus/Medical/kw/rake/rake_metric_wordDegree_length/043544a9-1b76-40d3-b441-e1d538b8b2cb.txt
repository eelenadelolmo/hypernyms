Surgical resection.
Dural based mass in anterior-medial portion of middle cranial fossa on the right.  Roughly hemispheric in shape with a broad dural base and enhancement of the adjacent dura and cavernous sinus.  There very extensive vasogenic edema.
Meningioma, WHO Grade 1
<li>Meningioma
<li>Atypical meningioma
<li>Anaplastic meningioma
<li>Hemangiopericytoma
This is a 67yo white man with Hx of HTN, CM, and MI X 3
reports of right-sided weakness, facial droop, dizziness leading to a fall.  He reports no loss of consciousness, no post-ictal period. No loss of bowel or bladder function.

The patient reports some generalized weakness over the last month as well as headaches.
This case demonstrates an unusually large amount of intraaxial vasogenic edema and the patient is male.  Both of these factors may suggest an aggressive diagnosis such as hemangiopericytoma, anaplastic, or atypical meningioma.  However, as was seen in this case, even typical WHO Grade 1 meningiomas may have surprisingly large amounts of edema.
