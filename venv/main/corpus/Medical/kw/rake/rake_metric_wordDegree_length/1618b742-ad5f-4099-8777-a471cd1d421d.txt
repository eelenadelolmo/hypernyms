His Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was 15 when initially evaluated.  Exam notable for multiple facial abrasions and contusions.  There were no focal neurologic deficits.
The patient was placed in a cervical spine orthos and scheduled for follow-up imaging in six weeks.
Minimally displaced fracture of the Right lateral mass of the Atlas (first cervical vertabra).
Atlas fracture

20 y/o male ejected from a vehicle during a rollover crash.  The patient reports a brief loss of consciousness.
Given the stability of the fracture and the lack of neurologic findings, conservative management was appropriate.
