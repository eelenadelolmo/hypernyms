VS:  BP 100/70, pulse 80, RR 16, afebrile
General: cachexia
Heart: sinus tachycardia
Lungs: bilateral crackles
Abdomen: scaphoid, non tender
Neurological: Oriented to name, year, and month but not place date or time.

Laboratory tests revealed the patient to be mildly anemic and to have a abnormally low white cell count
Transfered back to the institution where the patient usually receives his medical care.
AP chest radiograph demonstrates a bilateral fine homogeneous pattern of mildly increased interstitial density though which the bronchial markings of the lungs are still well identified. 

Axial CT shows widespread mildly variant ground glass interstitial opacities bilaterally with a lower lung field predilection and thickening of inter-alveolar septae.  This constellation of findings is sometimes referred to as the "crazy paving sign."

40 year old man presents with chronic mild cough, weight loss, progressive fatigue, and mild confusion.
By interviewing patient family members and by contacting the patient's doctor, an extensive redundant work up was avoided.  In retrospect, even the CT scan was unnecessary to make the diagnosis.  It is important in include an attempt to obtain outside medical records whenever obtaining a history and physical.  This is a case in point of this too often neglected basic clinical principle.
