Texto: 
Very dense bones which are especially noticable over the lower spine on the lateral exam or when comparing the right and left humeral heads.
  There are surgical clips in the left axilla and absent left breast shadow.
Metastatic Breast Cancer with diffuse osteoblastic metastases to bone.
General differential of diffuse osteosclerosis:
Flourosis
Renal osteodystrophy
osteopetrosis
Osteoblastic metastasis (Breast and Prostate most commonly but may be seen with cancers arising from the Brain, Bowel, or bladder or with lymphoma).  The diffuse involvement would favor Breast Cancer in a female or Prostate cancer in a male.
Prior history of Breast cancer
