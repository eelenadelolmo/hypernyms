Patient was alert and oriented.  Physical exam was significant for 4/5 strength in Right UE and 2/5 strength in Right LE.  No other neurologic deficits were noted.  HIV test was negative. TEE demonstrated no vegetations.  Coagulation panel was within normal limits.  Extensive laboratory work up failed to identify any abnormalities.
Patient was treated with whole brain XRT, but could not tolerate the side effects.  He was discharged to home for palliative care.
Patient has multiple ring-enhancing lesions with increased T2 signal within the deep cerebral white matter involving both hemispheres.  Three of the lesions are centered on the periventricular area.  A fourth lesion is present on the superior portion of the corpus collosum and a fifth cystic lesion in the posterior parieto-occiptial area.  No deviation of the midline is appreciated.
Brain biopsy confirmed patient has glioblastoma multiforme.
Lymphoma, Glioblastoma multiforme, tumefactive multiple sclerosis, toxoplasmosis, neurocystercercosis, cryptococcus
Patient presented with right-sided weakness and tonic-clonic activity in his right upper and lower extremity.
Glioblastome multiforme (GBM) is the most common type of primary brain tumor in adult patients.  It has an equal distribution among men and women with a peak incidence in the fifth decade of life.  It is the most aggressive type of astrocytoma and has a poor prognosis.  The average survival after diagnosis is eight months.

Some patients (like this one) have multicentric GBM which is an uncommon and often more aggressive form of this disease, occurring in less than 1 - 15% of patients with GBM.  It is characterized in this patient by its presence in both cerebral hemispheres.

The two most common presenting symptoms are headache and seizure.  Hemiparesis was the most common neurologic deficit at presentation occurring in up to 83% of patients.  This patient denied headaches, but did have seizures and hemiparesis.  The imaging finding of ring-enhancing lesions is not specific enough to be diagnostic.  Ultimately, a biopsy of the lesions was required for definitive diagnosis.CT or MRI can be used to image patients with suspected brain lesions.  However, MRI is more sensitive and CT can miss lesions in the posterior fossa.  In a small study looking at imaging in patients with multifocal glioblastoma multiforme, it was found that the lesions were always hypointense or isodense on CT and hyperintense on T-2 weighted MRI.  Ring-like enhancement was also a common finding.
