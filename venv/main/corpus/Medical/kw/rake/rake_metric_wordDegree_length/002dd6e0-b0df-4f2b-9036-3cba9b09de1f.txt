Texto: 
No palpable thyroid nodules.  Currently taking thyroid replacement therapy under endocrinology care and is euthyroid.
Closely monitor thyroid function.   Patients are at risk for developing thyroid lymphoma.  Monitor for other autoimmune disorders. Screen Family members.
Enlarged, hypoechoic, and heterogenous grainy with multiple tiny 1 - 6 mm nodules.  Late stage may appear fibrotic.  The thryoid gland most often has normal sonographic blood flow.
Hashimoto's Thyroiditis
-Graves disease if subclinical.  Thyroid blood flow may be helpful in differentiating disease spectrum.  
-Riedels thryoiditis if fibrosis is predominant pattern but Hashimotos is confined to gland.
-Primary thyroid lymphoma. Closely associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis
-DeQuervain thyroiditis is subacute viral induced thryoiditis with sonographically edematous and hypoechoic thyroid gland.
Mom with history of autoimmune thyroiditis.  Patient complains of fatigue.
The young male's mother has history of thyroiditis.  His enlarged gland and clinical hypothyroidism increased the probabilty of his autoimmune thyroiditis.
