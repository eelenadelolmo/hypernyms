Surgical treatment of soft tissue changes such as fasciotomy, capsulotomy, tendon lengthening, and excision of fibrous tissue.  Osteotomies, excision of hypersostotic bone, and amputation are also performed on these patients, although recurrence is common
characteristic lesion demonstrates a wavy hyperostosis resembling &#8220;dripping wax&#8221; appearance down the shaft of the ulna.
Melorheostosis
Differential diagnosis includes other sclerosing dysplasias, such as osteopoikilosis and osteopathia striata; osteoma; parosteal sarcoma; sessile osteochondroma; periosteal osteoblastoma; and ossified parosteal lipoma.
man with Rt hand and wrist pain increasing recently. Radiographic evaluation was requested to rule out degenerative arthritis.
