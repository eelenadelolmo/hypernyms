This man has a seizure history beginning with episode of loss of consciousness with incontinence at age 14, and subsequently right sided upper extremity seizures and speech arrest episodes. Diagnosis was epilepsy, treatment was dilantin without good control. After several years patient stopped taking dilantin and had a generalized tonic clonic seizure with right eye deviation. CT showed a calcified right parietal nodule and the diagnosis of cysticercosis was made. Patient was referred to another hospital for further study and treatment, where praziquantel and dexamethasone were given with definite but fluctuating clinical improvement. At this hospital, patient was also noted to have new onset right elbow and forearm pain and swelling.
(1) Plain film of right elbow shows multiple oval calcifications in the soft tissues, oriented longitudinally, consistent with cysticercosis. Noted also is anterior displacement of the anterior fat pad of the distal humerus, consistent with effusion. 

(2) MRI of forearm shows a hyperintense signal
localized within the digitorum superficialis muscle with a central hypointense structure, possibly calcium. These findings suggest an inflamed cysticercosis cyst. Absence of ring enhancement suggests that abscess is not present. 

(3)MRI of brain shows multiple focal lesions; the small hypointense focus on the convexity of the right parietal lobe corresponds to the calcification seen on first CT. There are two ring enhancing lesions, one in the high convexity of the left parietal lobe and the other- in the medial aspect of the right parietal lobe. These lesions were present but non-enhancing in an MRI done several months previously. There are also two nodular densities in the right occipital pole which do not enhance but which have a zone of edema evident in the T2 images, unchanged from previous images. And there are two small non enhancing lesions in the cerebellum which did enhance in the previous MRI.
Cysticercosis (Brain, Skeletal Muscle)
34 yo southeast asian (Indian subcontinent) man with seizure history beginning at age 14.  Also noted to have new onset right elbow and forearm pain and swelling.
The disease is caused by the pig tapeworm Taenia solium. Larval cysts form in skeletal muscle and brain of people who ingest ova or proglottids via the anal- oral route. Larval cysts more usually form in the muscle of pigs and people thus usually ingest larva, and grow tapeworms, via the improperly cooked pork route. Symptoms are most frequently referable to CNS disease, and include seizures, headache, and hydrocephalus. 

Diagnosis is made in the context of exposure history, plausible signs and symptoms, and brain images showing solid nodular or cystic lesions; CSF analysis is non-diagnostic. Plain films showing calcification in skeletal muscle, and plain skull films showing intracranial calcium, are highly suggestive but rarely seen. 

Treatment is praziquantel with concomitant steroid to control the inflammatory response to dying larva.  Response is not good if the cysts have been present for many years as in this patient, and in continued anti-seizure medication is part of long term management.
