One point to consider in the evaluation of these patients is the timing of the contrast enchanced soft tissue neck CT.  The patients are frequently imaged emergently in the Emergency Room due to concern for abscess.  CT is very accurate at making this distenction, but the initial CT rarely changes clinical management.  Phlegmon and abscess are managed clinically with antibiotics for 24-48 hours before drainage is considered in most cases.  If the patient is clinically stable, CT can be postponed until the patient has received a trial of IV antibiotics.   This will decreased the amount of CT's actually required.
Retropharyngeal Inflammation
6 year old male who presents with a four days history of sore throat and fever as high as 103. The patient was seen at an outlying urgent care four days ago and had a negative rapid strep test. At that time he was started on axomicillin. He continued to have fevers and sore throat. He was then seen at an outside ED and his antibiotics were changed to ceftin and prednisone was added. Recently he has had marked decreased PO intake over the course of a day and evening of admission he had drooling and difficulty breathing. Mother also endorses decreased urine output. No sick contacts.
