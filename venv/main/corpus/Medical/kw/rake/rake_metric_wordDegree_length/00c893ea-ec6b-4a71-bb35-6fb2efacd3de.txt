Examination: 2x2 cm ulcerated plaque with a heaped-up border.
Course: The lesion was excised.  Further evaluation by theHematology/Oncology service revealed masses in the body and tail of the pancreas with metastatic disease to the liver and right hip. He underwent chemotherapy but died approximately seven months after diagnosis.
Histopathology: The biopsy shows a focally ulcerated and crusted epidermis with an underlying dermal infiltrate of atypical appearing epithelioid cells forming glandular structures. Scattered neutrophils and mucin are also identified. The neoplastic cells are cytokeratin-7 positive, cytokeratin-20 negative, TTF negative, and PSA negative.
