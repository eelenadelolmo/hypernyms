FINDINGS
&#61548; Scintigraphic evaluation of the thyroid with 24hr radioactive iodine uptake and pertechnetate study show decreased RAIU of 0.6% and no appreciable trapping of pertechnetate.
Subacute Thyroiditis
&#61548; Other causes of this finding include use of thyroid replacement meds, recent IV contrast, and Struma Ovarii
(i.e. ectopic production of thyroid hormone)
CLINICAL SCENARIO
&#61548; 39 y/o female with clinical and biochemical hyperthyroidism.
&#61548; Sx&#8217;s include increased appetite, nervousness, sweating.  No neck pain.  The patient noticed sx&#8217;s over last few weeks.  She had a viral illness approximately 4-6 weeks ago.
PROCEDURE
&#61548; Radiotracers:
&#8211; I131: T1/2 = 8 days, B- decay, Principal photon energy: 364 KeV, Produced in a reactor.

&#8211; Pertechnetate: T1/2 = 6hr, Decay by isomeric transition, Principal photon energy: 140 KeV, Produced in a generator.

&#61548; 5 uCi of I131 is administered PO.
&#61548; Should concentrate in gland and the functional status can be determined.
&#61548; 24 hrs later, concentration in thyroid gland is determined using a single crystal counting probe and compared to an identical &#8220;standard&#8221; dose in a neck phantom.
&#61548; Correction for background activity is made and the following equation is used to determin % thyroid uptake:
&#61548; % uptake=Counts in neck-Counts in thigh  X 100
             Divided by Counts in Standard

&#61548; To obtain thyroid gland morphology, 2-5 mCi of Tc Pertechnetate is administered IV.
&#61548; 20 min later the gland is imaged with a scintillation camera with pinhole collimator.
&#61548; Anterior, and left and right anterior oblique images are acquired.
