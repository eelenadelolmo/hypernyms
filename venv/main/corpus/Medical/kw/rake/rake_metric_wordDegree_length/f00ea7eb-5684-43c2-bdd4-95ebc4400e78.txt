No significant findings.
Continued on glucocorticoid therapy and testosterone for his associated hypogonadism.
Ultrasound of the left testis demonstrates a lobulated, hyperechoic mass.

44 year old male with Addison's Disease on glucocorticoid and testosterone therapy s/p R orchiectomy.
This patient had typical clinical findings of Addison's disease prior to initiation of glucocorticoid treatment and thus had elevated levels of ACTH to stimulate development of the adrenal rest tumors.  He initially underwent right orchiectomy prior to his diagnosis because the lesions were intially believed to be lymphoma.  Classically, adrenal rest tumors appear as multiple round, hypoechoic nodules near the hilus and are usually bilateral.  However with this patient, his residual adrenal rest tissue appears hyperechoic on ultrasound.  This is believed to be secondary to the tissue undergoing extensive fibrosis, and it may be associated with acoustic shadowing.  This patient's adrenal rest tumor did not show significant change despite glucocorticoid therapy.  Serial sonography is recommended to document stability and regression in tumor size during therapy, and because there is a very rare chance of malignant degeneration.
