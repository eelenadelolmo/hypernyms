Same as above.
Initially, the PA and lateral view of the chest gives the impression of a right upper lobe mass.  Careful evaluatin demonstrates a partial margin that is well circumscribed with the remainder of the margin seen to blend in with the surrounding tissues, a finding common of chest wall masses.  Close inspection also demonstrates an enlongated configuration with periperal rim of calcific density, following the rib in expansion but maintaining the cortical margin.  This mass is lucent, expansile of the anterior right second rib lesion and without periostitis. Overall, the appearance is that of a non-aggressive lesion.  Hazy, ground-glass internal matrix is present.

CT would be helpful to further confirm the findings identified on the plain radiographs.
Fibrous Dysplasia
The appearance is that of a fibrous lesion.  This is a common location for Fibrous Dysplasia.  Depending on the age of the patient and whether the matrix was recognized, you could also consider:

Plasmacytoma
Metastatic focus
Enchondroma
Osteo- or chondrosarcoma
33 year old woman with painless, firm, right upper chest mass of insidious onset and growth.
Given the lack of agressive features and the matrix identified within the lesion, as well as the relatively long segment of involvement of the rib, the appropriate diagnosis should be possible.
