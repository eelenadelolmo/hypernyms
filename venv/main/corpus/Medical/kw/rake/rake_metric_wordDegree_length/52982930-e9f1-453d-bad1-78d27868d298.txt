Hx not provided
Sialolithiasis is an accumulation of hardened deposits in the salivary ducts. The most common site of occurrence is in the submandibular  (Warthon’) duct  which accounts for about 80% of all salivary duct stones.1  The large majority of cases occur in patients over 30 years of age with rare occurrences in children. The exact etiology of stone formation in the salivary ducts remains uncertain however it is believed to be the result from trauma, inflammation of the ductal epithelium or other processes which slow the movement of saliva down the salivary ducts resulting in stagnation. Patients typically present complaining of neck swelling and colicky pain, though this patient denied pain. Diagnosis is achieved through direct palpation of the stone and imaging which should include CT with contrast or ultrasound. Sialolithiasis often leads to Sialoadenitis, which is inflammation of salivary gland, caused by granulomatous processes or more typically in the case of Sialolithiasis infection caused by bacterial migration up the obstructed duct.  Staphylococcus, Streptococcus viridans and S. pneumoniae are usually implicated in the infection. 2   Treatment is with broad spectrum antibiotics, sialogogues (sour candy to promote salivation), massage, manual removal of stones near the orifice. 1(p1239),2(p935)  Failure of these treatments should prompt consideration of surgical intervention, which is not considered first line treatment due to the high incidence of post-operative stricture formation and resulting predisposition for chronic Sialoadenitis.1(p1240
