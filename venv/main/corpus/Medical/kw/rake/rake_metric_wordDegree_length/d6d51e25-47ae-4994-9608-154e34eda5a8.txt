The only laboratory abnormalities were mildly elevated liver function tests.
The patient is being treated conservatively. She is doing well.
The CT scan demonstrates inflammatory changes of the sigmoid colon consistent with diverticulitis.  There are also two abnormal collections of air.  The bladder (non-instrumented)has air inside.  Another pocket of air between the bladder and abnormal sigmoid colon is seen.
The retrograde cystogram demonstrates an abnormal collection of contrast adjacent to the bladder.  Later images show contrast extravasating retrograde up the descending colon, proving a fistula between the sigmoid and bladder.
Sigmoid diverticulits with enterovesicular fistula
Enterovesicular fistula due to Diverticulitis
Adenocarcinoma of the colon with fistula
68 year old female with hx of breast CA in the past has mild diffuse abdominal pain.  No history of abnormal stools.  No prior abdominal/pelvic surgery or instrumentation.  Patient had been started on antibiotics three days earlier as an outpatient for presumed cystitis based on an abnormal UA.
This case demonstrates a known common complication of diverticulitis - fistula formation.  In this case, the diagnosis was confirmed by using a retrograde cystogram.  Other options to confirm the diagnosis include a barium enema.  The Bourne test, another confirmatory and more sensitive test, starts with a barium enema.  A catheterized urine specimen is drawn and centrifuged down, followed by a radiograpy compared to a control. Even a small amount of barium will be seen in this method, indicating a fistula.
