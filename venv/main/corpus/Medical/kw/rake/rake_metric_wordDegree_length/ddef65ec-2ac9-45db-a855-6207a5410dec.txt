none contributory
Surgical pinning, right sided only
two images of the pelvis show right sided subtle SCFE, post-traumatic in nature.
Traumatic SCFE (Salter Harris Type 1 Fracture for the Femoral Head)
congenital hip dysplasia
Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease
1 week history of right sided hip pain and limp.  All starting after report of being struck by a car.
In contrast to SCFE due to unknown etiology or obesity, this case was interesting in the fact that an acute traumatic episode caused the SCFE.  This makes this a Type 1 Salter Harris Fracture.
