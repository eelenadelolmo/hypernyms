Recommend orthopaedic consultation treatments vary from casting to surgical.
Complete osseous bridging of the talus-calcaneus at the middle subtalar joint.  Prominent osseous beaking of the anterior process of talus with degenerative changes of navicular.  Small calcaneal enthesophyte. Suggestion of pes planus.
Talocalcaneal Tarsal Coalition
None
37 year old female with chronic ankle pain observe for any abnormalities or DGN changes.
Talocalcaneal Tarsal Coalition

The coalition can be fibrous, cartilaginous, or osseous and reflect either an acquired anomaly secondary to trauma, infection, articular disorders, or surgery, or a congenital fusion.  Congenital cause is unknown with failure of segmentation of primitive mesenchyme and differentiation being the leading theory.  Familial association suggesting a genetic basis.  Isolated partial coalitions are classified based upon structures affected: calcaneonavicular, talocalcaneal, talonavicular, and clacaneocuboid. Talocalcaneal and calcaneonavicular coalitions being the most common.  

Talocalcaneal coalition as in this case occurs most often at the middle facet between the talus and sustentaculum tali.  More common in males and bilateral in 20-25%.  

A Harris-Beath view and lateral radiographs obtained to evaluate.  

Secondary radiographic signs:
Talar beaking: dorsal subluxation of navicular due to subtalar rigidity causing production of a beak at the dorsal surface with a similar excrescence on the navicular.  
Broadening of lateral process of talus related to valgus angulation of the calcaneus.  
Narrowing of the posterior facet subtalar joint 
Concave undersurface of the talar neck and asymmetry of the talocalcaneonavicular joint.
Failure of visualization of the middle subtalar joint
Continuous C-Sign formed by medial outline of the dome of the talus and the posteroinferior outline of the sustentaculum tali.
Ball and socket ankle joint decreased subtalar motion with concavity of the talus
