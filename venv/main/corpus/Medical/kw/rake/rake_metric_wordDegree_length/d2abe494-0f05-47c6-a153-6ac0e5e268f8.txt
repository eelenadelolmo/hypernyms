As the patient was asymptomatic, no treatment was indicated.
Non-enhanced virtual colonoscopy images demonstrate a soft tissue density mass within the right lower lobe.

Intravenous contrast enhanced CT of the chest demonstrates a well-defined mass within the right lower lobe with an arterial supply arising from the abdominal aorta.  Lung window images demonstrate no air-filled bronchi within the mass.

3D reconstructed image from the Vitrea workstation demonstrates the mass within the right lower lobe adjacent to the right hemi-diaphragm.
