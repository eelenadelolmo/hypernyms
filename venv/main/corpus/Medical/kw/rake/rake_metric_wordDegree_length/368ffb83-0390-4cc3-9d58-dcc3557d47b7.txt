Texto: 
No visual field defect.  No endocrine abnormality.
Biopsy with no significant resection attempted.  No radiation or chemotherapy.
CT  shows a heterogenosu suprasellar mass with ring type calcification.
MRI - T1-weighted shows the lesion as hyperintense.  With gadolinium contrast administration there is homogeneous enhancement.  
There is no significant compression of either the optic chiasm or the pituitary gland.
Craniopharyngioma
Aneurysm (giant, calcified)
Craniopharyngioma
Epidermoid or Dermoid cyst
Meningioma
Osteochondroma
