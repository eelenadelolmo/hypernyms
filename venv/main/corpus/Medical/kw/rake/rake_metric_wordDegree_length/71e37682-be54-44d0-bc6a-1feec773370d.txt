The bilateral collections were surgically evacuated.
Non-contrast CT of the brain demonstrates bilateral frontal subdural hemorrhages of varying chronicity.  The right collection contains some prominent areas of high density, consistent with acute on-chronic hemorrhage. The left collection also contains a small amount of high density that may also represent acute blood.  Overall, these collections are roughly symmetric in size and cause no midline shift.  There is no hydrocephaplus; the ventricular systems are smaller than expected for age, perhaps secondary to
compression by the extraaxial fluid collections.
Acute on chronic bilateral subdural hematomas.
Acute on chronic bilateral subdural hematomas.
Recent onset gait disturbance and history of 2 falls in the past 6 weeks.
