Pulses:  Diminished right radial pulse.  Prominent right digital pulse. Provocative hyperemia reflex.  Following cuff occlusion, absent right upper extremity pulse.  Cold water provocative test produced mottling left hand.  Delayed capillary refill bilaterally, right worse than left hand. DP pulse normal.  PT pulse is not palpable bilaterally.  F, B, P pulse normal.

The patient was educated about his medical condition.

He was encouraged to wear long gloves and socks all winter long

He was told to consider the use of a small space heater during his job driving a shuttle bus as necessary.

Medical therapy with ASA, Plavix, proton pump inhibitor, and procardia.
Initial arteriogram of right hand demonstrated global severe arterial spasm.

After diagnostic and therapeutic injection of nitroglycerin, the spasm completely resolved.

Reflex sympathetic dystrophy
Diseases with Raynaudâ€™s component
Hyperthenar hammer syndrome
Neurological modalities such as shingles or peripheral mononeuropathies
Patient complains that during the winter months when the weather gets cold, his hands and feet get cold.  On the day o exam, in November, patient is wearing a thick sock and long underwear.  Two days prior to admission, patient noticed slight pain and weakness in right thumb.  The next morning, he felt pain, pins, and needles in his right hand.  On the day of admission, he had paresis of his fingers and numbness in his hand.  Later in the day, he developed pain in the distal forearm.
PMH: s/p malaria and flu as a child
SH:  Denies tobacco use
Because of the patient's slightly heightened creatinine, he was hydrated with a D5W/Bicarbonate solution.  The IV fluids were warmed to avoid recurence of his symptoms.
