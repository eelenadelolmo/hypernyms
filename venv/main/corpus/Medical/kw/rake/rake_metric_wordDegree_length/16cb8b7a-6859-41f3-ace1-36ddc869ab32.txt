Chest exam: Diffuse decreased breath sounds with associated diffuse wheezing.  
Labs: Elevated hepatic enzymes.
Patient listed for liver transplant
Abdominal CT demonstrates a nodular hepatic contour.  CXR reveals hyperinflated lungs.  Chest CT reveals basilar-predominant hyperlucent lungs with significant oligemia.  Nuclear Medicine V/Q scans demonstrate patchy pulmonary perfusion and basilar-predominant air trapping on Xenon washout imaging.
Alpha 1-antitrypsin (serum trypsin inhibitor) deficiency
Swyer-James (post-viral) syndrome
Toxic inhalation (toxic liver injury)
Genetic syndrome (A1AT deficiency)
Pulmonary/hepatic venoocclusive disease
44-yo female with progressive shortness of breath and RUQ abdominal pain.  She denies smoking, alcohol use, and has no history to suggest pneumoconiosis or other explanation for progressive shortness of breath
