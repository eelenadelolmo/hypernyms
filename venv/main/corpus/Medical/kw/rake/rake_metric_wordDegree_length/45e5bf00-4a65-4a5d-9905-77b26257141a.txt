The child was afebrile with stable vital signs, and was non-septic in appearance .   Abnormal findings of physical exam revealed mild grunting with respirations with otherwise clear lung sounds; the abdomen was mildly distended (girth 14 inches), with rare bowel sounds which were high-pitched in the RLQ, soft to palpation with a palpable loop of bowel in the epigastrium; she had a patent anus. The child was otherwise normal
KUB/AP and Left Cross Table Lateral:

     There is an enteric tube that follows the course of the esophagus and has its tip overlying the body of the stomach on the lateral view. On the KUB, the enteric tube is coiled such that the tip overlies the lower esophagus.
     On the KUB, the stomach is situated normally, but is markedly distended. Approximately 7 air-filled loops of moderately distended small bowel are visible in the LLQ/LUQ. There is no free air visualized within the peritoneum. The bowel mucosa is not appreciably thickened. No stool is visualized within the bowel; there is no evidence of "soap bubbles" and no submucosal air is visualized. Bowel loops are conspicuously absent from the RLQ; however there are several small flecks of calcification in the RLQ just cephalad and lateral to the right iliac crest on the KUB. No large bowel or rectal air is noted.
     The soft tissues of the abdomen and pelvis, and the osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable.

Patient is a six-hour-old 3870 gram white female born at 40+ weeks EGA to a 38 year-old G2P1-2 caucasian female via a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery.  Later that same day the child was noted to have several episodes of bilious emesis.  Suctioning of the gastric contents at this time revealed 25-30cc of feculent-green material. She was then transferred to another hospital for evaluation by a pediatric surgeon. Child has no family history of cystic fibrosis
Complete or partial obstruction of the small bowel or colon are not uncommon in the neonate, and a variety of causative lesions are possible, including atresias, meconium ileus, colonic aganglionosis, volvulus, necrotizing interocolitis, intussusception, and incarcerated hernias, just to name a few.
     Vomiting, abdominal distension, and failure to pass meconium are all symptoms highly suggestive of obstruction. Vomiting of bile suggests the lesion is distal to the ampulla of Vater. Abdominal distension may be present soon after birth, reaching a peak at 24 hours. Failure to pass meconium within 24 hours is highly suggestive of colonic obstruction, as even those with obstruction as low as the ileum will pass meconium. Normally, air fills the stomach immediately after birth secondary to air-swallowing; air typically fills the small bowel within 12 hours, and the colon within 24 hours.
     Our patient's lesion can be localized to the distal small bowel, somewhere near the jejunoileal junction. Although the films were taken shortly after birth, not necessarily giving enough time for air to totally fill the small bowel, the distension of the bowel that is filled suggests that air has filled as far distally as allowable by the obstruction. As the duodenum is short, one would not expect to see 7 loops of bowel from a duodenal obstruction. Likewise, if the ileum were patent one would expect to see more than 7 loops of bowel, and at least some of these loops should be present in the RLQ. The absence of ANY air distal to the obstruction makes stenosis unlikely.  The lesion most likely represents a TOTAL obstruction of the distal jejunum/proximal ileum (the operative report indicated mid-ileal atresia with 15 cm of markedly dilated proximal ileum).

     Atresias account for a third of all intestinal obstructions in the newborn, occurring in approximately 1 in 1500 live births. The greatest proportion of atresias are jejunoileal (55%), followed by duodenal (30%) and colonic. The suspected etiology of isolated jejunoileal atresia is vascular compromise early in gestation, whereas duodenal atresia is thought to be due to failure of the gut 10 recanalize in the 8-10th weeks of gestation.
Signs and symptoms of jejunoileal atresa include maternal polyhydramnios, bilious emesis, abdominal distension (which may not be apparent until the 2rd or 3rd day of life), failure to pass meconium, and jaundice. On a plain film, dilated loops of bowel with no gas in the rectum are seen. Contrast enema may not reach the obstruction, but the appearance of a microcolon in the normal anatomic position makes other lesions, such as malrotation, colonic atresia, and agangliosis unlikely. Multiple air fluid levels are usually present, and allow differentiation from meconium ileus; however, in some cases, gas mixed with meconium can be seen in the distended small bowel loops, giving the so-called "soap-bubble" appearance typically associated with meconium ileus. It is not possible to differentiate distal small bowel obstruction from colonic obstruction on the basis of plain films alone; generally contrast studies are necessary. Intramural calcifications can be seen in infants with small bowel atresia; these calcifications can be either clumpy or linear. The clumpy calcifications are thought to represent calcification within necrotic bowel, but explaining the linear calcifications is more problematic.
Another reason that meconium ileus was unlikely in our patient is that in 90% of cases, meconium ileus is associated with cystic fibrosis...an inherited disease almost exclusively of white males. Colonic aganglionosis (Hirschprung's Disease) usually affects only the distal colon, and therefore presents with dilated large AND small bowel. Total colonic aganglionosis CAN present as a small bowel obstruction...but this entity is VERY rare.
Correction of ileal atresia is surgical, typically a resection of necrotic, distended bowel followed by a primary anastomosis. It is typically performed in the 1st or 2nd day of life. The mortality of this procedure is typically less than 10%. A possible long term consequence of this procedure is vitamin B12 deficiency.
