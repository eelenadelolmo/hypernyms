Texto: 
fluctuant, ill-defined soft tissue swelling over scalp, mostly on R side and posterior head
Resolution expected in 2-3 weeks, as is typical for subgaleal hemorrhage.  Blood transfusions and volume replacement as needed to maintain intravascular volume.
CT: Hyperdense collection of blood seen deep to galeal aponeurosis, crosses suture lines, extends to nape of neck.
Subgaleal Hemorrhage
Subgaleal Hemorrhage
Cephalohematoma
Caput succedaneum
newborn girl on day of life #1 with coagulopathy, delivered via C-section with large scalp hematoma.
The subgaleal hematoma is differentiated from a cephalohematoma because it crosses calvarium suture lines and extends into the nape of the neck.  A cephalohematoma is essentially a subperiosteal hematoma on the outer table of the skull.  A caput succedaneum is scalp edema, not hemorrhage.
