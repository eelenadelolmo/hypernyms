Pertinent physical exam findings included:
Â» splenomegaly to 1 cm below the costal margin
Â» mild tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant
Â» 1-2 cm firm immobile nodule left midclavicular costovertebral margin
Â» midline tenderness to T12 and L1
Â» decreased range of motion in flexion secondary to pain.

The patient was placed on amphotericin B and fluconazole and was discharged from the hospital. However, he returned to the hospital one month later with worsening back pain. Imaging demonstrated progressive disease. He was placed on multiple antifungal therapies with no success. The patient was then placed on interferon gamma and posaconazole with noted improvement.
The frontal and lateral views of the thoracic spine demonstrate a mixed lucent/sclerotic appearance of the T12 vertebral body and the left pedicle. 

A sagittal view MRI with gadolinium of the thoracic spine and lumbar spine demonstrates enhancing lesions multiple vertebrae, including T12.  Soft tissue enhancement is also present from T9-L2 paraspinal muscles. 

A sagittal nonconstrast CT obtained several weeks later demonstrates worsening expansile lytic lesions to T10, T11, and T12.

MRI of the thoracic spine was obtained five months after the patient began treatment.  Interval worsening present at multiple levels, including multiple compression deformities and enhancing mass with cortical disruption and contiguous anterior soft tissue mass lifting the anterior longitudinal ligament.  Involvment of the posterior elements is present with narrowing of multiple neural foramina and spinal cord compression.
Disseminated Coccidioidomycosis
--Osteomyelitis, including mycobacterial and fungal.
--Metastatic disease
--Multiple myeloma
The patient is a 23 year old man who presented with four weeks of persistent mid back pain. He received pain medications with minimal relief. His pain gradually worsened over three months to involve his left leg and hip. The patient had associated fevers, weight loss, night sweats, fatigue, and intermittent abdominal pain.
Coccidioidomyocosis is a common fungal infection in the southwestern United States. It usually leads to a self limited pulmonary infection. However, in less than 5% of cases, the infection can disseminate to the soft tissue, meninges, and bone. Those who are most susceptible to dissemination include the immunocompromised, pregnant women, and certain ethnic groups, such as Latinos, Filipinos, and African Americans. The most common antifunals used to treat disseminated coccidioidomycosis includes amphotericin B and the azoles. The patient was initially placed on amphotericin B and fluconazole, but his disease progressed. He was placed on itraconazole and posaconazole with no improvement. He was then placed on interferon gamma because it was believed that his immune system was unable to recognize Coccidiodes. He was also placed on posaconazole, after which he improved. He was discharged from the hospital. He will require lifelong antifungal therapy.
