Texto: 
Physical exam notable for atrophy of the soft tissues of the hands, ulnar deviation of the proximal phalanges with respect to the metacarpals, and surgical scars about the forearms, wrists and hands.
Patient is new to this facility.  Treatment is pharmacological at this time.  The patient is taking oxycontin, prednisone, and methotrexate.
Multiple views of the hands demonstrate severe erosive changes at the MCP joints, ulnar subluxation of the proximal phalanges on the metacarpals, uniform and symmetric joint space loss of all MCP and PIP joints, erosive changes and collapse of virtually all of the carpals, diffuse muscular atrophy and osteopenia, and orthopedic surgical fixation devices spanning the wrist and metacarpal area bilaterally.  The distal ulna on the left has been resected.  The distal ulna on the right has a fracture of the prosthetic distal portion.  Lucency of the radius prosthesis and prosthesis in the right 3rd metacarpal likely indicates loosening, although infection could give this appearance.  A boutonniere deformity of the left index finger is seen.  Subluxation at the right DIP is also noted.
Central erosions with some proliferation of bone are seen at the 5th DIP joints bilaterally and the right 3rd DIP as well.  These changes are consistent with concomitant erosive osteoarthritis.
