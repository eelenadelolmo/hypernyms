The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent a pericardial window procedure the following day with excellent results.  There was and immediate and dramatic reduction in the size of the effusion (and cardiac silhouette).  The remainder of his hospital stay was uneventful.
The follow-up appointment film demonstrates a small right pleural effusion, with otherwise clear lungs.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged and demonstrates a 'hilar overlay' sign with borders extending beyond the hilum bilaterally.  Midline sternal wires are intact c/w a history of CABG.
