Wide excision with placement of proximal humeral prostheses.
AP left shoulder: 2001 ‚Äì  an ill-defined sclerotic density is present within the humeral head adjacent to the articular surface.  A subtle ring of lucency can be seen around the centralThere is no evidence of sclerotic margin, periostitis, soft tissue mass. 
	
	AP shoulder: 2002 ‚Äì There has been interval increase in the amount of amorphous calcific density within the lesion.  

	CT shoulder ‚Äì a round lesion is noted within the humeral head.  This lesion has a central area of dense calcification surrounded by a area of ‚Äúfluffy‚Äù calcification.  An area of lucency then surrounds this.  There is no clear violation of the overlying cortex.
	
	MR ‚Äì Coronal/Axial TI ‚Äì A well-defined low signal abnormality is noted in the subchondral bone of the humeral head.  A central punctuate area of signal void is present representing the dense calcification seen on CT. There is no significant surrounding edema or joint effusion. The overlying cortex is intact.

	MR ‚Äì Coronal/Axial T2 ‚Äì The lesion demonstrates high signal with central area of low signal representing dense calcification.
Clear Cell Chondrosarcoma
Differential Considerations:
	Bone lesions which may have this appearance in this location include:
	-chondroblastoma
	-clear cell chondrosarcoma
	-osteoblastoma	
	-sclerotic metastasis
	-brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism ‚Äì in healing phase due to calcification
