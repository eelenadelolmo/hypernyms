‚Ä¢Pain in lower back that has progressed from a ‚Äú2‚Äù (out of a 10 point pain scale) in  March 2010 to a ‚Äú7‚Äù in May 2011
‚Ä¢Tightness in lower back with forward flexion
‚Ä¢Straight leg raise on the right is accomplished to 55? with pain in the lower back, right buttock, and right posterior thigh extending to the medial thigh. 
‚Ä¢Posterior to anterior compression over the spine produced pain over the right sacral region at S3 and bilaterally at S4
‚Ä¢Hypersensitivity was noted over the right sacral region
This patient decided to pursue conservative management and continues chiropractic care 1x-2x per week to attenuate her symptoms.  It is possible that she may seek other therapy, non-surgical or even surgical approaches, if her symptoms do not abate.
‚Ä¢Sagittal T1 and T2 MR images of the lumbosacral spine show a 2 cm diameter low and high signal cyst posterior to S1, respectively.

‚Ä¢Myelogram: 1 large right-sided sacral cystic dilation
Tarlov cyst, may have become symptomatic post-pregnancy
‚Ä¢MRI helps to rule out common causes of low back pain: disc herniation, vertebral fracture, spondylosis, spondylolisthesis

Post-MRI differential:
‚Ä¢Tarlov Cyst
‚Ä¢Arachnoid cyst
‚Ä¢Neurofibroma
‚Ä¢Dural ectasia
‚Ä¢Meningocele
The patient is a 29 year old female who presents for a chiropractic evaluation following a MVA in 2/2010, who complains of neck and low back pain. After the initial accident, physical therapy, and initial chiropractic treatment, she notes a major improvement in her neck and low back pain. 

In April 2011, the patient delivers a healthy baby girl. 3 months later, she presents for a chiropractic evaluation due to significantly worsened low back pain, right posterior thigh, right buttock pain, and tightness in the inguinal area that has developed over the last 2 months.

The patient in this case developed right sided symptoms consistent with the location of the 2cm cyst. These included low back pain and pain in the S1 dermatome that also extended to lower sacral regions. These and other symptoms have been described in patients with Tarlov cysts, especially when the diameter exceeds 1.5cm. It is possible that the aggravating factors of trauma and pregnancy, which the patient experienced, are associated with a symptomatic cyst. 

It should be noted that this patient may suffer from low back pain for other reasons, which should also be considered including an underlying disorder, muscle strain or spasm, or trauma not visualized by the imaging.

To manage her symptoms, the patient may choose to seek additional nonsurgical or surgical approaches in the future. No consensus exists for the best treatment approach for a Tarlov cyst.
