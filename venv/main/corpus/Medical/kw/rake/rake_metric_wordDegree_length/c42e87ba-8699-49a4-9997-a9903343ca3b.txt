The patient is alert and oriented x 4 and in no acute distress on presentation, however his voice is notably hoarse. His head is atraumatic and his oral mucosa is moist. Neck is atraumatic with trachea midline and no apparent JVD. Subcutaneous emphysema is palpated along the anterior chest wall without any evidence of bony deformity or signs of trauma. Lungs are clear and equal bilaterally in all fields. Cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen is soft, non-distended, and mildly tender to palpation over the epigastrum without peritoneal signs. Bowel sounds are normoactive. His extremities exhibit no peripheral edema or signs of trauma.

Labs: WBC 13.9, Hgb 13.7, Hct 40.6, Plt 230, Na 139, K 3.7, Cl 99, CO2 26, BUN 14, Cr 0.7, Glu 77, Ca 9.4, Mg 2.1, PO4 3.0
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis, which demonstrated extensive pneumomediastinum, retroperitoneal free air, and subcutaneous emphysema without evidence of esophageal perforation or deformity of the large airways. The absence of any historical, exam or radiological findings suggestive of another cause for pneumomediastinum makes a spontaneous etiology most likely.

Out of an abundance of caution, he was admitted to the cardiothoracic service for further evaluation (r/o perforation) and monitoring. 

He was made NPO and started on antibiotic therapy as well as an IV pain control regimen. A CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis was obtained and ruled out esophageal perforation. After he remained afebrile for 24 hours, his diet was advanced and well tolerated with resolution of his odynophagia. At this point it was determined that no surgical intervention would be necessary. 

His WBC normalized and subcutaneous emphysema improved by day 3, at which time he was discharged with a 7-day course of antibiotics. He was scheduled for follow-up with cardiothoracic surgery at 1 week post discharge.
Chest X-Ray: Lung fields are clear. There is mediastinal air present. Pleural margins show a small apical pneumothorax on the left and a trace apical pneumothorax on the right. Diffuse subcutaneous emphysema along anterior chest and both sides, as well as in the soft tissues of the neck. There is also intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal free air.

This 18 year-old male U.S. Marine Corps recruit presented to the ED with "bubbles under his skin" and a sudden change in his voice. Over the last few hours, he reports an acute decrease in exercise tolerance and he now becomes short of breath with minimal exertion. He first appreciated the bubbles, which are primarily along his upper chest and the base of his neck, after he suddenly felt pain in the area while bending forward. Additionally, he endorses pain with swallowing as well as epigastric pain. He denies any trauma, recent illness, nausea, vomiting, or shortness of breath at rest. Of note, he does report that he has been "screaming a lot" during his training.

The patient has no past medical or surgical history, takes no medications and has no allergies. He does not consume alcohol, use tobacco or illicit drugs. He currently is in the first week of USMC recruit training and lives in the barracks.
Spontaneous pneumomediastinum, or the presence of gas in the mediastinal spaces not associated with trauma or iatrogenic cause, is an uncommon entity. It is generally associated with underlying lung diseases, such as asthma or cystic fibrosis, making its occurrence in a young, healthy Marine recruit quite unusual. After imaging ruled out any obvious esophageal or tracheobronchial deformities, it was hypothesized that the origin of the free air was small airway rupture secondary to extreme vocal strain. 

Interestingly, this patient is not the first Marine in which this phenomenon has been documented. In their 2012 article in the Journal of Military Medicine, Singla, Potocko et al report an instance of spontaneous pneumomediastinum in a Marine Corps drill instructor. This raises the question of how many other motivated Marines (or their Sailor, Soldier and Airman counterparts) have experienced spontaneous pneumomediastinum without being recognized or seeking care. http://publications.amsus.org/doi/pdf/10.7205/MILMED-D-12-00243
