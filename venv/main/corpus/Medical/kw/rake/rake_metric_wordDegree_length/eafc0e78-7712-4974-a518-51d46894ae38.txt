After the injection of Tc-99m-HDP, flow and blood pool images were obtained, followed by delayed planar images.  In addition, tomographic (SPECT) images and non-contrast enhanced CT images were obtained using a gamma camera/CT fusion camera system.  Images demonstrate increased blood flow and pool within the left maxilla.  Markedly increased focal radiotracer uptake is visualized within the left maxilla, with a ground glass appearance on fusion and CT images, consistent with fibrous dysplasia.  CT images also demonstrate narrowing of the bony nasal lacrimal canal, and acquired hypoplasia of the left maxillary sinus.
Fibrous dysplasia
Fibrous dysplasia
18-year-old female with diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia of the left maxilla, post two debulking procedures.
If scintigraphic images alone were available for this case, the differential would be huge, as virtually any medical condition that causes osteoblastic activity and regional blood flow to bone will demonstrate markedly increased skeletal tracer activity as described above.  Bone dysplasias associated with increased skeletal tracer include fibrous dysplasia, osteogenesis imperfecta, osteoporosis, progressive diaphyseal dysplasia, hereditary multiple diaphyseal sclerosis, and melorheostosis.  Given the classic ground glass appearance of fibrous dysplasia for this lesion, however, the differential is quickly narrowed.

Although bone imaging of fibrous dysplasia with skeletal tracers reveals a high percentage of lesions with increased uptake, care must be taken in the diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia with bone imaging alone.  Not only is the differential broad, but in a study of fibrous dysplasia by Machida et al., four of 29 cystic lesions, and two of 30 lesions with the appearance of ground glass showed no increase in radiotracer uptake.  Lesions commonly demonstrate increased perfusion, in addition to focal uptake.

Bone scintigraphy is very sensitive in the detection of osteoblastic lesions, and is felt to be particularly useful in the evaluation of oromaxillofacial lesions for the formulation of treatment plans.
