+tnderness to palpation over McBurney&#39;s point.
Increased WBC count
Fever to 102 F
Treatment is surgical.
Ultrasound demonstrates a dilated, blind-ended tubular structure with surrounding fluid.
CT confirms a massively dilated appendix with surrounding inflammatory changes.
Acute Appendicitis in Cystic Fibrosis Patient
Prior to imaging, the most important diagnostic consideration is to rule out appendicitis.  Additional entities which patients with Cystic Fibrosis are predisposed  to include intussusception, Crohn Disease, fibrosing colonopahty and bowel wall edema secondary to hypoproteinemia.
10 y.o. girl with known cystic fibrosis presents with acute onset of right lower quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis.
Although the pulmonary manifestations of Cystic Fibrosis are prominent, significant morbidity secondary to gastrointestinal disease is also seen.  Concerning bowel, CF patients are at a higher risk for the development of meconium ileus, meconium ileus equivelent, intussusception, GERD, Crohn Disease, fibrosing colonopahty and bowel wall edema (from hyproteinemia).
With respect to  appendicitis, however, the incidence is actually lower in patients with CF.  This is important to remember when imaging a patient with CF for appendicitis as the appendix may be dilated to 6mm without obstruction or inflammation.
