MRI of the brain with contrast demonstrates a 2-cm left posterior frontal parasagittal meningioma.  
The lesion demonstrates diffuse enhancement and no significant surrounding edema.

• Lymphoma
• Metastatic carcinoma
• Inflammatory lesions (ex: sarcoidosis & Wegener's granulomatosis)
• Meningioma
• Infections (ex: TB)
