The physical exam was non-contributory, as were the labs prior to the study.  Once the mass was discovered, it was then noted to be palpable.
The mass was resected.  The patient is beginning treatment at this time.
There is a large, well circumscribed mass emanating from the left kidney.  A "claw sign" is noted, indicating a renal origin.  There is no capsular breakthrough or vascular invasion.  Lymph nodes are seen centrally in the mesentery.
