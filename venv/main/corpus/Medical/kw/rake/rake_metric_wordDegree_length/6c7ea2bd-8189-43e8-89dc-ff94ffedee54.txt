The bladder, ureters, and uterus were excised due to spread of disease.  Several lymph nodes were also positive at surgical excision.
Ultrasound of the bladder reveals a lobulated echogenic mass adherent to the bladder wall - with significant internal blood flow on color Doppler.  

CT images demonstrate a lobulated, irregular mass of the posterior bladder wall with associated hydronephrosis and hydroureter.  

Additionally, there is tumor extension posteriorly through the bladder wall and into the adjecent uterus.

36 y.o. woman with gross hematuria
This case illustrates the classic findings for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.  These lesions are commonly discovered due to hematuria.  As in this case, ultrasound commonly demonstrates a bladder mass with internal blood flow, and associated obstructive hydronephrosis.  These US findings were confirmed on CT imaging.
