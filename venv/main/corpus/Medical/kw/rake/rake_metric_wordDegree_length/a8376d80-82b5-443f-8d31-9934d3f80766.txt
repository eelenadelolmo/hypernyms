Extra-axial cystic mass in the posterior fossa, posterior to the right cerebellum and demonstrates low T1, high T2/FLAIR signal, with restricted diffusion on the DWI images and no significant enhancement on the postgadolinium images.  

Additionally, incidentally noted is a mega cisterna magna.
Epidermoid Brain Tumor
Arachnoid cyst

Epidermoids are classically T1 hypointense, T2 hyperintense, FLAIR hyperintense, and demonstrate restricted diffusion on DWI. No enhancement on the postgadolinium images.  They can be differentiated from an arachnoid cyst, which follow CSF signal intensity on all sequences (as opposed to the restricted diffusion and FLAIR hyperintensity seen with epidermoids).  Additionally, arachnoid cysts may demonstrate scalloping of the underlying bone.
