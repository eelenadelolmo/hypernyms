Urine cytology: Suspicious for malignant cells of glandular differentiation, likely urothelial.  Most likely origin a high grade carcinoma.

UA, Basic Metabolic Panel otherwise unremarkable.
Thickened right posterior bladder wall with calcifications and several polypoid filling defects.
Bladder Cancer
Transitional cell carcinoma, SCC, cystitis (infectious and non-infectious, schistosomiasis, tuberculous), metastatic or invasive cancer, foreign-body associated encrustation
Recently developed gross hematuria in an otherwise asymptomatic individual.
The constellation of findings, including gross hematuria in a person with a calcified bladder mass with no history of other neoplasms, TB, or a travel history to suggest schistosomiasis, makes TCC the likely culprit.
