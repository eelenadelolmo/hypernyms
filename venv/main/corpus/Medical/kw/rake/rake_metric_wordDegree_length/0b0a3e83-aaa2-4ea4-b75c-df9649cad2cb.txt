Chemotherapy followed by surgical resection of posterior ribs 7,8,9.  She is currently in remission.
• Chest Radiographs:
There is a large left-sided pleural based mass with erosion of the eighth posterior lateral rib adjacent to the mass.

• Chest CT w/ contrast:
There is a well defined heterogenous right posterolateral pleural based mass causing modest compressive atelectasis of adjacent lung parenchyma.

• Whole body bone scan using Technetium 99m two days later:
Increased tracer uptake within right posterior lateral eighth rib.  No evidence of distant metastasis.
Ewing Sarcoma
• Neurofibroma or Schwannoma
• Ewing’s Sarcoma (Askin tumor)
• Solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura
• Hemangiopericytoma
• Metastasis (Metastatic neuroblastoma in children)
• Plasmacytoma (unlikely at this age)
• Desmoid tumor
12 year old girl presents to the ER with a complex history including frequent episodes of RUQ pain and vomiting. A previous abdominal CT (outside hospital) showed an ovarian cyst, possible gallstone, and a lung mass - described as pneumonia versus tumor. She was treated for pneumonia at that time, and her pain improved.  Repeat CT scan was not performed.  Around the same time, patient was referred by her school for scoliosis screening.  The thoracic mass was present on these scoliosis films but was not noted on the report.
This patient presented with an incidental finding of a soft tissue tumor surrounding the posterior eighth rib consistent with Ewing's Sarcoma.  There was no evidence of distant metastasis.  The patient was treated with chemotherapy and surgical resection and is currently in remission.
