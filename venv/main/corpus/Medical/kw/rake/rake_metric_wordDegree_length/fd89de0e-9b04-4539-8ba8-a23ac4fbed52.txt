No exam findings given - Referral from primary care.
Patient will be referred to an Orthopedic surgeon for specialty evaluation and determination for usefulness of an ACL reconstruction.
Plain films generally unremarkable, with 'deep lateral sulcus' sign on the lateral projection.  On the sagittal T1 MR, there is complete disruption of the ACL with a posterior 'pseudomass' composed of bunched portions of the ligament.  Axial PD MR confirms discontinuity of ACL fibers and posterior bunching of the ligament.  On coronal T1 and T2 images, there are 'kissing contusions' of the lateral femoral condyle and lateral tibial plateau.  Disruption of the ACL is again confirmed.
Lateral Femoral Notch Sign
1. Complete ACL tear
2. Partial ACL tear
22 y/o male with pain after basketball injury.
This case demonstrates the usefulness of plain films as the 'deep lateral sulcus' was not originally identified.  Review of the patient's film jacket yielded this plain film series which was performed approximately 1 month prior to the knee MRI.
