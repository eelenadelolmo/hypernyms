Texto: 
Results of treatment of esophageal cancer are disappointing. A large percentage of patients are inoperable at presentation. Chemotherapy is essentially not effective. Radiation therapy has been used successfully for palliation and occasionally is curative. Cancer of the lower one-third of the esophagus leads itself most readily to surgical resection. Prior to tumor resection, intra-operative evaluation is made for involvement of celiac and periaortic nodes as well as for liver metastasis. If these structures are involved, no resection is attempted. If resection is attempted, the extent of the resection may physically prevent re-anastamosis necessitating the use of a colon transplant.

Cancer of the Gastro-esophageal junction
39 y.o. white male with progressive dysphagia, first to
solids, then to liquids
Pathology: Cancer of the gastro-esophageal junction can be either a primary esophageal cancer invading into the fundus of the stomach or a primary gastric carcinoma originating in the fundus and extending into the lower esophagus.
Cancer of the esophagus is most commonly squamous cell carcinoma. Distribution tends to be middle>lower>upper third of the esophagus. Males tend to develop it four times as frequently as females; however, the upper esophagus is involved ten times as frequently in females (thought to be due to Plummer-Vinson syndrome). The second most common are adenocarcinomas which tend to be in the lower esophagus. They very rarely arise from esophageal submucosal glands. Rather, they tend to be an invading gastric adenocarcinoma or an adenocarcinoma arising from the columnar cells of a Barrett's esophagus.
Cancer of the stomach is typically an adenocarcinoma. They most commonly (50%) occur in the antrum of the stomach but 10% do tend to arise in the fundus. The incidence rate is slightly higher for males than females.

Risk Factors: The overall incidence rate in the US for esophageal cancer and for gastric cancer are similar (10/100,000). The rates tend to be much higher in Japan and China. Aside from Barrett's esophagus, esophageal cancer is associated with tobacco use (smoked and chewed), poor dentition, and alcohol abuse. The etiology of gastric cancer is more mysterious but is thought to be an
environmental or dietary factor. In addition, achlorhydria, pernicious anemia, and atrophic gastritis have been shown to be risks for gastric cancer.

Clinical presentation: Tumors of the esophago-gastric junction most commonly present with dysphagia which may be accompanied with a sensation of substernal fulness. There may or may not be pain. Dysphagia is typically with solid food first but later involve soft food and liquids. If the lumen should become obstructed, the- patient becomes unable to swallow his own saliva leading to constant drooling. Weight loss commonly occurs in later stages of the disease leading to severe emaciation.
