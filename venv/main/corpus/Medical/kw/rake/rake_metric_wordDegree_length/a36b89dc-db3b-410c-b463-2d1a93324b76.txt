Texto: 
Prompt perfusion to both kidneys.  Symmetrical uptake bilaterally.  A smaller appearing left kidney, with the suggestion of a photopenic region at its superior aspect.  Spontaneous exretion of radiotracer bilaterally.  Findings not inconsistent with a functionally anephric upper moeity of a duplicated left kidney/collecting system.
