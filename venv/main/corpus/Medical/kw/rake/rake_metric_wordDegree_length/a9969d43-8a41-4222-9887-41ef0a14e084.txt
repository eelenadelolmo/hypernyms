Mental status change with abnormal laboratory values.
Treatment of Osmotic myelinolysis is to centered on the slow correction of the offending hyponatremia.
T1WI shows a low signal area centered in the pons without enhancement on post Gd T1WI sequence.  T2WI shows increased sigal in the centered in the pons.  Diffusion weighted sequence also shows high signal in the pons.
Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) (osmotic myelinolysis)
Pontine glioma, Ischemia/Infarct, Multiple Sclerosis, Radiation change, Osmotic myelinolysis
32 year old who presented to the emergency department with a history of alcohol abuse.  The following day the patient was noted to be obtunded.
Osmotic myelinolysis is commonly found in patients with a concomitant history of alcoholism, malnourishment or chronically debilitation.  Pathologically it is characterized by myelin loss with relative neuronal sparing.  The central pons is the most common site of involvement (90%) but can also be seen affecting the basal ganglia, thalami, and sub-cortical white matter.  If a NECT were available it would show a noon-specific hypodense region to normal scan of the affected region.  The MRI changes are secondary to increased water content, with enhancement patterns varying.  Signal abnormalities involving the Pons can have a wide ranging differential including: Infarct, glioma, MS, encephalitis, and radiation changes.  If concomitant abnormality is seen in the Basal Ganglia then the differential narrows to hypoxia, Wilsonâ€™s Disease and Leighâ€™s Disease.  A combination of radiologic findings and clinical history is usually helpful in narrowing the diagnosis.
