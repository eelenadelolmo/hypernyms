• Acute bilateral Cerebellar infarcts.
• Acute right pontine infarct.
• Acute right temporal-occipital lobe infarcts.
• Acute bilateral thalamic infarction (Artery of Percheron) infarcts
• Chronic infarct right basal ganglia.
• Wallerian degeneration right cerebral peduncle.
Basilar artery thrombosis, bilateral cerebellar and cerebral infarcts
• Basilar/PCA territory infarcts
• Artery of Percheron thrombosis
70 year old woman presents to ER with altered mental status.  History of extensive right MCA infarct 16 months earlier.
Acute bilateral (medial) thalamic infarction may be caused by thrombosis of the  Artery of Percheron.  Percheron described three arterial variants: bilateral medial branches of P1 with perforating vessels; a single or dominant unilateral P1 branch supplying both thalami with perforating vessels; and, an arching artery connecting the two P1s, with an arcade of perforating vessels.
