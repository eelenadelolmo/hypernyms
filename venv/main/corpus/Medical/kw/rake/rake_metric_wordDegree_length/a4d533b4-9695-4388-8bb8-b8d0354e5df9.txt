Acute Abdomen, no vaginal bleeding. CBC: H/H 11.9/34.2, WBC 15.6; Lipase, Chemistry, and Liver Function panels normal
While multiple options are available for complicated ectopic pregnancy, rupture is an indication for emergent surgery. This patient was treated operatively with salpingectomy.
The uterus is visualized and is normal in size, shape and echogenicity with a 2.2 mm endometrial stripe. There is no sac or fluid collection within the uterus. No adnexal ring or definite fetal pole is identified. Hyperemia is evident in the wall of the fallopian tube by Doppler US. There is a large amount of hypoechoic material outside of the uterus consistent with a large amount of blood in the pelvis and cul-de-sac. There is hypoechoic material suggestive of blood between the right kidney and the posterior liver (Morrisonâ€™s pouch), as well as above the liver.

Ruptured Ectopic Pregnancy
23 y/o female with known pregnancy who presented to the Emergency Department with complaint of severe abdominal pain
This patient also was imaged via an acute abdomen series, with no abnormal findings. Also visualized ultrasonographically was a hypoechoic fluid collection between the right kidney and the posterior liver (Morrison's Pouch).
