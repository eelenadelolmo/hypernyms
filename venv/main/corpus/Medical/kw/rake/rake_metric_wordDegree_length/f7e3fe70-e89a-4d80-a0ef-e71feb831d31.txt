Abdomen tender to palpation in both lower quadrants. No palpable masses appreciated.
On her transvaginal US, bilateral dermoid cysts was suspected as well as a larger mass. Subsequent CT confirmed bilateral dermoid/teratoma cysts as well as a large fibroid causing displacement of the right ovary. 

In cases where the dermoids are <6cm, they can be followed with serial imaging. However, if symptomatic, the treatment is bilateral simple cystectomy.
CT Report:
Ovaries are somewhat prominent in size bilaterally. Contains well circumscribed areas of fat density as well as faint areas of increased density suggestive of teratoma. The right ovary projects at midline superiorly on the pelvic CT apparently displaced by pedunculated uterine fibroid.  On review it is noted that the right ovary has calcium/bone within it and might be better understood as a mature Teratoma.  Whereas, the left ovary does not demonstrate the finding of calcium/bone in the same manner and might better be described as a dermoid cyst.
Mature Cystic Teratoma
The adnexa refers to the anatomical region adjacent to the uterus containing the fallopian tube and the uterus and includes the ligaments, vessels and soft tissue surrounding these structures. A variety of pathology can arise here. The differential for an adnexal mass includes:
? Physiologic/Functional cysts such as a non-ruptured follicle causing follicular cysts)
? Leiomyoma (fibroids) though typically arising from the uterus can also be found in the broad ligament
? Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
? Pelvic inflammatory disease causing pyosalpinx, hydrosalpinx, abcesses, past scarring (“clubbing” of the fimbriae)
? Benign Ovarian Neoplasms: serous and mucinous cystadenoma, endometrioma, mature teratoma
? Malignant Ovarian neoplasms
? Metastatic carcinoma such as Krukenberg
? Neoplasms arising from other structures such as the broad ligament and fallopian tube
31 yo G1P1 woman, had US done for locating an IUD. Pt states she has had pain in her abdomen, buttocks and lower back on and off for 2 months. The pain is sore and cramping in nature. 2/10 at rest, 6/10 when exacerbated with touch or sneezing. The pain does not radiate. It is worse in the morning. She also noticed increase in menstrual flow. Pt attributed these symptoms to her IUD, and decided to change types. The IUD was unable to be found visually on physical examination in the office, which led to the US. Subsequent CT was done to confirm US findings. 

Of note, approximately 6 months prior to these images, the patient was hospitalized for acute bleeding and a rash. She was diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenia. She was transfused and stabalized, and discharged after a 5 day stay. She has subsequently followed up with hematology and rheumatology, and was given a course of prednisone and hydrochloroquine. Her repeat serial CBCs have been stable and she has remained asymptomatic.

Mature cystic teratomas are commonly asymptomatic and are only found on incidental imaging. In this patient,  it is likely her abdominal pain is due to the mass effect of the large fibroid displacing her ovaries and other pelvic structures. Any pain due to the stretching of the ligaments would be exacerbated by jerky movements sudden increase in pressure such as sneezing. The patient has decided to undergo attempted laparoscopic resection.

Approximately 6 months prior to the patient&#39;s incidental finding of her mature teratoma, she was urgently hospitalized for an acute onset of bleeding and rash. She initially presented with epistaxis and also a rash after scratching her arm. The rash was described as flat round dots and very dark.  The rash spread to involve her lips, fingertip and back of mouth. As her rash got worse, she went to the ER where her CBC showed a platelet count of 6,000. Subsequent work up was negative and she was diagnosed with Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP).  ITP is a condition where there is immunologic destruction of platetes, due to the formation of IgG to various antigens, such as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Pt was transfused and after three days her platelets were elevated to 114,000. She has since been given a course of steroids and hydrochloroquine. Subsequent hematology and rheumatology followup has not suggested any chronic disease contributing to her episode of ITP. Subsequent CBCs have been stable, and the patient remains asymptomatic.

Although ITP has never been associated with Mature Cystic Teratomas specifically, there have been case reports of paraneoplastic ITP associated with ovarian cancer, and other malignancies such as Breast, and Lung [1]. It has been suggested that malignancy associated ITP is not an uncommon occurrence and a separate classification of this "secondary ITP" should be considered. Because malignant transformation is unlikely in classic mature cystic teratomas, and lack of research in this area, it is not clear that in this patient her ITP is of an analogous paraneoplastic etiology. 

However, there have been two reported autoimmune paraneoplastic syndromes associated with mature cystic teratomas: Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA), and Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis [2-3]. AIHA is similar to ITP in that, the mechanism involves IgG (or IgM, IgA) formation vs RBC antigens such as Rh factor. Interestingly, in the reported cases of AIHA, a portion of patients were refractory to steroid treatment. Only the resection of the cysts led to symptom resolution, thus supporting a causal relationship. Proposed theories of the pathophysiology include the creation of antibodies or the modification of red blood cells by the teratoma itself. 

Therefore, because mature teratomas have been associated with AIHA, and ITP is of a similar pathophysiologic process, I suggest that it is not unreasonable to consider this patient&#39;s mature teratoma a possible etiology of her episode of ITP. Further research to elucidate the relationship between ITP and neoplasms may be of clinical benefit to patients, in terms of treatment and neoplasm detection.
