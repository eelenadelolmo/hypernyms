Tachycardia
Elevated D dimer test
Otherwise normal physical exam findings and BMP
Surgical resection was performed because of malignant potential of neoplasm.
On CT imaging an incidental 3.6cm mass was seen in the tail of the pancreas.  Follow up contrast enhanced CT demonstrated a macrocystic mass in the tail of the pancreas with a coarse calcification.  No pancreatic ductal dilation was seen.
Pancreatic Mucinous Cystic Neoplasm (Mucinous Cystadenoma)
1. Mucinous cystic neoplasm (macrocystic cystadenoma)
2. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm
3. Pseudocyst
4. Adenocarcinoma
5. Oligocystic variant of a microcystic serous cystadenoma
A 57 yo F with recent gastric bypass surgery developed shortness of breath and tachycardia several days after surgery.
During the patient's gastric bypass surgery the surgeon noted that the pancreas "looked funny".  Her pancreatic neoplasm was then later incidentally discovered on CT scan.
