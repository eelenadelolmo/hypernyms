Texto: 
Right cheek erythema and fullness.
Management: 

–Surveillance- annual skin check, jaw panoramic, brain MR (until 8), periodic TTE, avoid ionizing radiation

–Treat specific complication: eg. Odontogenic keratocysts- wide excision v. marsupialization  and enucleation 

–Avoid radiation tx in medulloblastoma- induces 100s of basal cells
Sinus plain film: complete opacification of right maxillary sinus

Sinus CT: right maxillary sinus expansive fluid containing mass and thinning of the boundaries of the sinus; impacted teeth in the maxillary sinus; bilateral mandibular cysts

MR of the face: Multiple T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense mandibular cysts and expansile maxillary mucocele
Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome; Gorlin-Goltz Syndrome
Multiple Odontogenic cysts is pathognomonic for basal cell nevus sydrome
8 year old girl with right malar swelling and pain.
Discussion

•Rare, AD inherited mutation in PTCH1 gene- tumor suppressor gene of sonic hedge hog pathway

•Multiple nevoid basal cell cancers, meduloblastomas, odontogenic keratocysts, cardiac and ovarian fibromas-age of onset differs

•Physical Exam: Craniofacial abnormalities (mild hypertelorism, macrocephaly), bifid ribs, palmar-plantar pitting, cleft lip/palat, polydactyly, cataracts and glaucoma

•Calcified cerebral falx, bridging of sella 

•Odontogenic Keratocysts- neoplastic, locally destructive, aggressive, recur

•Clinical diagnosis supported by high level of expression of PTCH 1 on keratocysts
