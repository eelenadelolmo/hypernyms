Texto: 
-Acral hypertonicity was appreciated on physical exam.  Symmetrical reflexes (brachial, patellar and achilles reflexes examined).  Decreased motor function globally.  Sensory appeared to be intact grossly.

-BMP, CBC, ESR, and CRP were all WNL.
-Original cranial CT was followed with MRI of spine and brain; pentobarb, fentanyl, and versed used for sedation during procedure
-Decadron administered for cerebral swelling
-Diamox was used to decrease CSF production
-Resp/Cardio/ID were consulted for further evaluation
-Type and Screen before the surgical intervention
-Zinacef for prophylaxis before neurosurgery 
-Surgery: Craniotomy and GTR of mass, JP drain placed in subgleal space (intraop)

Mass excised surgically; neoplasm was characterized by fronds of delicate vascular stroma, surrounded by a single layer of uniform cuboidal cells post H&E staining.  Mitotic figures were rare.   No indications of malignant transformation.
CT head w/o contrast: Shows large, lobulated, enhancing tumor in the atrium of the right ventricle with marked pan-hydrocephalus.    Mass measures 3cm x 2.5cm x 2.1cm

Nasal sinuses, mastoid air cells clear.

13-month old  girl with progressive loss of neurological function and increased irritability.  

Patient began to subtly regress developmentally, finally coming to the parentâ€™s attentions as she began to lose the ability to walk upright on her own.  As it progressed, parents state that she eventually started to lose the ability to crawl properly.  After the initial balance dysfunction, parents started to notice other losses of motor function, particularly her inability to feed herself.  As motor function declined and patient became lethargic, her irritability increased as well.  Family history was unremarkable for similar occurrences in other children or other neurological pathologies.  Past medical history was also unremarkable, previously being a healthy 13-month old, on tract with her growth and development.  She was not currently, or previously administered medications.  Patient immunization records were up to date.  ROS was negative with exceptions of findings previously mentioned.
- The insidious regression of developmental milestones noticed by the patient&#39;s caretakers, coincided with the chief complaint often seen in this age group.

- While often times there can be localized signs, our patient&#39;s neurologic dysfunction was characterized by more globalized loss.  However, these physical signs are to be expected with pan-hydrocephalus which was observed on imaging.

- Many of the classic, heralding physical signs such as nausea, vomiting, increased head circumference, and bulging fontanelles were either not present or masked by normal infancy behavior.

- Along with the nonspecific physical exam findings and insignificant past medical history, our patient&#39;s laboratory studies were all WNL; obscuring the diagnosis before imaging studies were completed.
