Texto: 
Exertional claudication complaints of the right lower extremity were reproducible. A non-palpable dorsalis pedis pulse on the right was found.
Pt had 3 episodes of CP while undergoing procedure, requiring early termination of same after little clot was removed. Anticoagulation measures.
Focal lesion in the right common femoral artery, nearly  occlusive, in the area of the previous intervention and closure device application. Superficial femoral and popliteal arteries are patent.
Angiographic complication. Near-occlusion of right CFA from iatrogenic injury during cardiac catheterization and application of closure device.
Extrinsic compression from:
tumor, hematoma, abscess
Intra-luminal occlusion from thrombus, atheroma, embolus.
Patient who underwent a cardiac catheterization 1 month prior who developed new onset right LE claudication symptoms after placement by the cardiologist of an angio-seal closure device.
Iatrogenic injury to right CFA from previous procedure and/or angio-seal closure device.
