79 y.o. woman reported drainage around mobile teeth 18 and 19. Antibiotics were initiated, and these teeth were easily extracted by her dentist. After debridement of associated chronic periodontal disease, the underlying bone was noted to be highly abnormal in appearance. The patient has a past medical history of Crohn’s disease necessitating colectomy, and she has been on steroid medications for most of her life. She also carries a diagnosis of osteoporosis and was started on oral bisphosphonate (ibandronate) therapy several years ago
Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) is an uncommon complication of long-term bisphosphonate therapy for osteoporosis. The majority (>90%) of reported cases of BRONJ have been in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy for malignancy (Watts and Diab, 2010). 

Predisposing factors to the development of BRONJ include dose and duration of bisphosphonate therapy, age, corticosteroid therapy, immune compromise, periodontal disease, surgery, and trauma (Chaturvedi et al., 2010; Khan, 2010). 

A mouse model for studying BRONJ-like disease uses an amino-bisphosphonate and methotrexate to induce the changes characteristic of BRONJ. These changes are associated with alterations in the activity of specific T cell subsets (Kikuiri et al., 2010). 

Scintigraphic studies demonstrate that bisphosphonates significantly decrease bone turnover in the mandible which may contribute to the pathophysiology of BRONJ as well (Van den Wyngaert et al., 2010). 

The diagnosis of BRONJ is made clinically after local malignancy is excluded (Khan, 2010).
