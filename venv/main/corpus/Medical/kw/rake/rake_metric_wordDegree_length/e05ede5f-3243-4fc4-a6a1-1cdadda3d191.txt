Gen: 47 y/o healthy, caucasian male, in mild distress
CV: Reg rhythm, slightly tachicardic, no rubs/murmurs/gallops
Pul: Clear to ascultation bilaterally
ABD: Slightly tender to palpation in R and L upper quadrant.  +Bowl sounds; Non-distended; neg Murphy’s; No guarding or rebound
Pulses: 2+ throughout

Pt was referred to interventional radiology for definitive diagnosis and possible treatment.  Interventional angiography confirmed presence of thrombus in the proximal superior mesenteric artery, involving most of the first 10cm of the artery.  Urokinase was infused in an attempt to lyse the thrombus with minimal improvement noted.  Pt was subsequently taken to the OR for exploratory laparoscopy, resulting in resection of approximately 20cm of small bowel, and re-vascularization of SMA.  Pt tolerated procedure well, and was improving at time of writing.
Abdominal CT (with contrast):1.  Mild stranding focally in the lesser sac, medial to the second portion of the duodenum, anterior to the third portion of the duodenum, posterior to the pancreas and just inferior to the pancreatic head, with mild stranding adjacent to the SMA.2.  Possible mild narrowing of the third portion of the duodenum between the SMA and aorta.Addendum: Small thrombus within the proximal portion of the SMA.  Distal to this region the contrast is not as bright as the proximal SMA, with mild adjacent inflammatory changes adjacent to the SMA consistent with SMA Syndrome.
Sub-acute thromboembolism of SMA
1.  Thrombus of SMA
2.  Mild focal pancreatitis
3.  Small perforation of medial 2nd portion of duodenum
47 year old, with 12 day hx of steadily worsening, crampy abdominal pain.  Pt reported experiencing sudden onset of pain on the morning of 01 Jan and worsening over the course of day.  Pt presented to local ED and underwent CT and US (both negative), was diagnosed with viral vs bacterial gastroenteritits, and released.  Pt and family returned to his geographical home, however the pain did not subside, and pt presented to the local hospital 2 days later (9 days prior to current presentation).  Pt was seen in the family health clinic and was referred to GI for workup and treatment for gastric ulcer.  He was started on prevacid and zantac, and sent home.  H pylori test at that time was negative.  The pain did not improve over the course of the next several days, and steadily worsened.  He stated that eating made it worse, and that curling into a fetal position helped.  On the morning of 13 Jan he presented to the ED again, stating that the pain peaked the night before, and the pain is as low as it has been in days.  Negative nausea or vomiting.  + fever and chills on initial presentation 01Jan, however currently afebrile.
