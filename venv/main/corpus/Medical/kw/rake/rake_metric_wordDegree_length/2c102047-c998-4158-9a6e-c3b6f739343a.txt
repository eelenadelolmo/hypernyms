This is thought to be due to chronic trauma of the medial collateral ligament or chronic tears. The origin of the ligament ossifies.  Most are asymptomatic but some develop limiting pain and motion.  Conservative treatment is usually used and surgery with excision is reserved only for severe cases.
Small calcification at medial aspect of the distal femur at origin of medial collateral ligament.
The Pellegrini-Stieda Syndrome
Chronic trauma (Pellegrini- Stieda)
Femoral Condyle fracture (no effusion or pain at this site)
Segond Fracture (not at inferior joint space, superior tibia; no focal pain at this site)
21yo male who recently twisted knee during an athletic event.
This calcific density should be recognized and not diagnosed as a fracture.  Although it can be asymptomatic, it is treated conservatively when associated with pain.
