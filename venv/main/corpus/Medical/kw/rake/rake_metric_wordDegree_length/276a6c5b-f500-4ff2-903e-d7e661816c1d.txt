• AV fistula
• Enlarged Straight Sinus due to
Straight sinus aneurysm
• Pineal region neoplasm (germ cell tumor, pineal tumor)
• Deep venous hypertension:
» Dural AVM
» Pial (parenchymal) AVM
» Dural AVF
» Hypoplastic Distal Straight Sinus
4 year old boy with speech delay
This case is unusual because the AV fistual drains into the straight sinus rather than the Vein of Galen.  Because this is not a high output shunt the patient did not present with the usual findings of cardiac failure.
The lesion is thought to be asymptomatic
