Texto: 
Pain along proximal tibia.
Casting and immobilization.
Original radiographs demonstrate focal cortical  periosteal reaction in the posterior proximal tibial diaphysis.

Follow-up radiographs after symptom worsening demonstrate a complete fracture at the previous site of stress fracture. There is increased periosteal reaction with dense sclerotic fracture line through the entire tibial shaft.

18 year old male who runs track in high school. Several weeks prior was told he had a stress reaction in his proximal tibia and instructed to stop activity. He ignored medical advice and continued running. Finally, severe pain caused him to seek additional medical care.
