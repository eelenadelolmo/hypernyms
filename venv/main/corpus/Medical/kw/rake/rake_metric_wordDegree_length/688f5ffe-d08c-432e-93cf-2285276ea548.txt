Decreased breath sounds on left.
Patient was bronchoscoped and suctioned to remove mucous plug.  Follow up CSR demonstrated marked improvement.
The AP radiograph demonstrates obscuration of the left heart border, retrocardiac decending aorta, and hemidiahpram.  Note the presence of a Kattan's Triangle -- the shift of the anterior junction line towards the side of volume loss.  The left main bronchus is depressed, and there is shift of the heart to the left.   
The two axial CT images demonstrate clearly the leftward displacement of the anterior junction line (causing the Kattan's Triangle) and the completely collapsed left lower lobe.
Left Lower Lobe Collapse
Left Lower Lobe Collapse
Left Lower Lobe Mass
Soldier in ICU s/p closed head trauma. On ventilator via tracheostomy. Waxing & waning oxygen desaturation and fever.
This case serves to correlate the plain film and CT findings of classic left lower lobe collapse.  Of particular note are the secondary findings of left lower lobe volume loss -- the Kattan's Triangle, depression of the left bronchus and the shift of structures to the side of volume loss abnormality.
