Labs:
Capillary blood gas â€“ pH 7.2, pCO2 48, base deficit -9.2

CBC â€“ H/H 13.1/40.0, WBC 9.0
Rapid influenza A/B EIA negative
Respiratory Infectious Disease Panel negative
RSV EIA negative
Final blood (5 days) and urine cultures (2 days) negative

EKG â€“ sinus rhythm (159 bpm), RAD, RAE, RVH, nonspecific T-wave abnormality
The patient was initially started on 100% blow-by oxygen, eventually changed to masked CPAP and then intubated (using Versed and Vecuronium) with bag ventilations. She was given a saline bolus of 20 cc/kg then started on MIVF. The patients color and perfusion began to improve. Pulse ox at this time was 99-100%. A Foley catheter was placed which returned small amounts of urine and the stomach was decompressed by NG tube. The patient was treated with Ampicillin and Claforan for possible intercurrent sepsis, and was started on IV prostaglandins for a suspected ductal dependent cyanotic heart lesion. Patient was noted to have a LE BP of 52/40 and UE BP of 105/44. 

Echocardiography was performed and because of the AP window, the patient was transferred hemodynamically stable on MIVF and prostaglandins to another hospital for care in the cardiac ICU and surgical intervention.
CXR portable AP:
- ET tube with distal tip at T4
- Markedly enlarged heart size with indistinct aortic arch
- Prominent vascular markings consistent with congestive failure
- Small Rt-sided pleural effusion

Complete M-mode, 2D, and Doppler echocardiography:
- Mildly dilated left and right atria
- Moderate patent foramen ovale noted in atrial septum with L-to-R shunting
- Moderate RV dilation and hypertrophy
- Mild concentric LV hypertrophy
- Small midmuscular VSD with L-to-R shunting
- Large AP window
- Small patent ductus arteriosus with L-to-R shunting
- Mildly dilated pulmonary arteries
- Narrowing of transverse aorta and severe coarctation just distal to the origin of the Lt subclavian artery
Aortopulmonary window
1. Congenital cyanotic heart disease
2. Coarctation of the aorta
3. Respiratory Distress Syndrome
4. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia
5. Methemoglobinemia
An 18-day old baby girl transferred to the ED from her PCPs office for cyanosis. She was born at 37 weeks gestation with a birth weight of 6 pounds 11 ounces after a mostly uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. The mother has chronic hypertension and had been taking Methyldopa throughout the majority of the pregnancy. The decision was made to induce labor when she became even more hypertensive. The patient began having increased fussiness and intermittent labored breathing with grunting about one week prior to ED admission, which had persisted. The day prior to admission the patient appeared gray and had increased difficulty breathing. The following day the patient was taken to the PCP when she was noted to be cyanotic. An SaO2 done at the office was 70% and ED transport was ordered. ROS was additionally positive for some fatigue with feedings and appetite change.
