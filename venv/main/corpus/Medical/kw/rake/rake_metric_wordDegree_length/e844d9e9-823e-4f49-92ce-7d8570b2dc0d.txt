Normal Chest Exam and labs.
See Discussion below.
PA and Lateral views of the chest demonstrate a homogeneous, well circumscribed, smoothly marginated, round mass in the anterior mediastinum.  This measures approximately 2.5 cm and is located anterior to the ascending aorta just of midline to the right.  No other abnormal findings are identified.
Anterior Mediastinal Mass Differential Diagnosis
Given the patientâ€™s age and the radiographic appearance, the best diagnostic considerations for this case would be:
-Thymoma
-Thymic cyst
-Germ Cell tumor
-Lymphoma (more common than above, but less likely given no symptoms and no other evidence for lymphadenopathy in chest)
34 year old male presents for pre-op chest radiograph prior to arthroscopic knee surgery to repair a ruptured ACL.  He is asymptomatic in regards to the chest.  Labs normal.
With only the chest radiograph, the differential is still quiet broad and definitive lesion characterization is best performed with a contrast enhanced computed tomography of the chest. 
This exam was sent via PACS to Walter Reed from an outlying clinic at Fort Detrick in Frederick Maryland.  After interpretation of the plain radiograph, the ordering clinician was called and a chest CT was recommended.  Unfortunately, at Fort Detrick, they send out there CT orders to civilian contractors, and neither the images nor the definitive diagnosis was available.
