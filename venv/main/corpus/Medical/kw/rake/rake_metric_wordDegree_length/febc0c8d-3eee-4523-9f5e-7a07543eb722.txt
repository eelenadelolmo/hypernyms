Treatment: Small and asymptomatic Zenker's diverticula do not require any treatment. Larger and symptomatic cases can be surgically treated by resecting the diverticulum and to incise the cricopharyngeus muscle. Another option may be endoscopic stapling via a fiberoptic endoscope.
â€¢ AP image demonstrates midline contrast collection compatible with a diverticulum located in the hypopharynx
â€¢ Lateral images showing focal posterior outpouching, positioned immediately above the cricopharyngeus.
Zenker's Diverticulum
â€¢ Zenker's Diverticulum
â€¢ Killian-Jamieson Diverticulum
83 y/o man has a history of pharyngeal dysphagia.
While a rare entity, Zenkers diverticula are most typically seen in elderly male patients with dysphagia.  Thus, our patient presents with the prototypical demographic and symptomatology.  The size of this lesion is small, and will likely be managed conservatively.
