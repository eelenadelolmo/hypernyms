Patient is a 63 y.o. white male who arrived to the ED after losing control of his motorcycle. 

He has a complicated cardiacvascular disease history, includung hypertension, coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, prior deep vein thrombosis, congestive heart failure, aortic valve replacement, AICD pacer, and atrial fibrillation.
Because the patient had acute trauma, the initial diagnosis was traumatic pseudoaneurysm.  However, after discussion with the cardiothoracic surgery team and a review of older CT scans, the correct diagnosis was made.
