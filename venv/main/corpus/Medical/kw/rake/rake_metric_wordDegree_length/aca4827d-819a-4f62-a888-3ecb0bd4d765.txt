Physical exam revealed a coarse voice with no dysarthria.  Extraocular movements were intact and pupils were equal and reactive.  There was atrophy of the tongue on the left and no gag reflex present.  Decreased left palatal elevation with phonation was noted.  There was also left vocal cord paralysis.  Examination of the neck was significant for atrophy of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle and the presence of a bruit.
The patient underwent preoperative embolization and surgical resection of the tumor and was managed postoperatively in the SICU.  She improved over the course of 9 days and was discharged home.  On follow-up clinic visits she was noted to have some improvement in her cranial nerve function including an intact gag reflex.  Her left vocal cord remains paralyzed and she continues to follow-up with otolaryngology and speech therapy.
â€¢ CT Temporal Bone: Smooth expansion of the left jugular foramen with flattening of the jugular spine. 

â€¢ MR:  There is a large enhancing mass in the left carotid space displacing the ICA anteromedially and extending into the left jugular foramen.  Large serpentine flow voids are visible within the mass on T1 and T2.  There is evidence of denervation atrophy of the left hemitongue (with fatty infiltration) and left SCM. 

â€¢ CTA Neck: Large, hypervascular mass that displaces the left ICA anteromedially.  A portion of the mass extends cephalad into the left jugular foramen and smoothly expands it.

â€¢ Conventional Angiogram: There is an intensely hypervascular tumor below the skull base with extension into the jugular foramen.  The tumor is supplied by branches of the posterior auricular and internal maxillary arteries.  The left ICA is displaced anteriorly and provides no blood supply to the tumor.
Vagal Paraganglioma
â€¢ Vagal paraganglioma
â€¢ Vagal schwannoma
â€¢ Jugular paraganglioma
â€¢ Carotid body tumor
â€¢ Carotid space meningioma
A 32 year-old woman presented with a several year history of dysphonia.  She also complained of difficulty swallowing for 2 years, as well as 6 months of numbness and decreased mobility of the tongue.
