Texto: 
Patient will most likely receive treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitor (eg Tacrine or Cognex) which may delay cognitive decline in the early to mid stages of the disease.
PET fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose scan with high resolution axial, sagittal, and coronal images demonstrate marked decreased uptake in the posterior parietal and temporal lobes bilaterally.
Alzheimer's disease based on PET findings and patient history. Cannot confirm the disease w/o brain biopsy.
Alzheimer's disease
Parkinson's disease (advanced)
Fifty seven year-old right handed female with worsening dementia versus pseudodementia over approximately two years.
Although the PET findings are not pathognomic for Alzheimer's disease, the images are highly predictive of Alzheimer's disease, particularly with patient's concordant history.
