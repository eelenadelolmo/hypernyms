Right lower extremity swelling.
Rim enhancing thrombus extending from the right proximal superficial femoral vein through the trifurcation of the right popliteal vein.
Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism
65 yo male complains of right lower extremity swelling and shortness of breath.
The indirect lower extemity venogram is performed about 3 minutes following a tight intravenous contrast bolus.  Maximal veinous enhancement occurs around 150 to 210 sec after contrast administration.  Maximal venous subject contrast occurs approximately at 3 minutes.  Adequate enhancement of the common femoral vein is hounsfield units above 80.  This allows for the diagnosis of acute thrombus which measures between 40-60 hounsfield units.
