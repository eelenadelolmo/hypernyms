Texto: 
Red, indurated, tender right breast.  Skin biopsy consistent with metastatic ductal carcinoma.
Consideration for induction chemotherapy followed by mastectomy and radiation therapy.
CC and MLO mammograms demonstrate asymmetrically dense right breast parenchyma without evidence of a focal mass or architectural distortion.

T2 and T1 pre and post gad and subtracted axial images of the breast demonstrate too numerous to count enhancing masses in the right breast parenchyma and skin with marked skin thickening.
Inflammatory Breast Cancer (Secondary)
Mastitis or breast abscess
Leukemic involvement of the breast
Ductal ectasia
Prior invasive ductal carcinoma with new onset painful, red right breast.
