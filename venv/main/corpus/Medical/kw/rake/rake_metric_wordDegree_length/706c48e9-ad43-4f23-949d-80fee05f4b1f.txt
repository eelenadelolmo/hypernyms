Texto: 
Patient demonstrated decreased pulses in the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedal arteries.
Patient was discharged after treatment.
Radiographic/Angiographic findings:  Diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries.  The right external iliac artery demonstrates 40-60% stenosis and the left internal iliac artery demonstrates a high grade origin stenosis.  The common femoral artery demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic disease without focal stenosis.

Patient’s femoral popliteal bypass graft is patent.  There is complete occlusion of the native SFA and profunda femoris arteries.  

The proximal peroneal artery demonstrates severe stenosis.

Treatment:  Following Cryoplasty of the proximal peroneal artery with a 3 mm balloon followed by a 4 mm balloon demonstrated no residual stenosis.
Cryoplasty of femoropopliteal atherosclerotic disease
N/A
Clinical History:  74 year old with left foot pain and ankle ulcer.  Patient with past medical history of hypertension, COPD, hyperlipidaemia, and peripheral vascular disease.  Past surgical history is significant for a right below the knee amputation.
Cryoplasty serves as another treatment modality to promote a longer term of patency in peripheral vascular disease.
