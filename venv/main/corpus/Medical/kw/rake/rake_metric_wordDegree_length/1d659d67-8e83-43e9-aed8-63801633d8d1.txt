The patient continues to have sickle cell crises with multiple hospitalizations. She is currently receiving chiropractic treatment for her shoulder pain. She is scheduled to have a repeat shoulder MRI to evaluate for rotator cuff tendinopathy or additional injury to the humeral head that she may have incurred from the accident.   The patient is also being referred for spine surgical evaluation for the findings of large disc herniation at C3/C4.

CC: S/P MVC

54 yo African American female with past hx of sickle cell anemia with avascular necrosis who presents s/p MVC on 8/29/13 when the vehicle she was in struck another vehicle at an intersection. She was a belted passenger. She recalls that her face struck the deploying airbag and she bit her tongue. She developed bruises over her right head, back, and abdomen. Her left shoulder was also injured. She denies any loss of consciousness. She hit her head but states that the head CT was negative for intracranial bleeding. Aside from her previous ailments from sickle cell disease and other comorbidities, she reports new onset neck weakness, posterior neck pain, right hand numbness, as well as left shoulder pain and weakness. She denies recent fever, chills, unexpected weight loss, vision changes, dry mouth, rash, chest pain, palpitations, wheezing, abdominal pain, NVD, constipation. She has a chronic cough from COPD. She also reports SOB.

The patient is a 54 yo African American female with past hx of sickle cell disease with avascular necrosis of the humeral head and COPD who presents with shoulder pain s/p MVC. In addition to the sickle cell associated osteonecrosis of her humeral head, she also has COPD, cervical disc herniation, and cervical radiculopathy. Furthermore, she has had osteonecrosis in other locations such as her fingers, some of which have been amputated after her most recent crisis. Given recent data that disc herniations may occur more from avulsion rather than rupture, this case raises the question of whether the underlying sickle cell disease contributed to or predisposed the patient to the condition, especially since the disease has affected her in multiple locations in the past (1). Further research regarding this subject may be warranted. Avascular necrosis of the spine has been reported in the past but not in association with sickle cell disease. Changes associated with osteonecrosis of the spine such as wedge-shaped lesions with hyperintense signals were not seen in the MRI (2). Histological analysis may be useful in identifying early changes such as loss of nuclear staining in adjacent marrow and empty osteocytic lacunae before the osteonecrosis is identified on MRI (3).
