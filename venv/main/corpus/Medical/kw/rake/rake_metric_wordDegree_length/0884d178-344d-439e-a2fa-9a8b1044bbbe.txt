N/A
Lengthing
  -Predicted discrepancy not exceeding 20cm
  -Hip that can be made stable
  -Adequate knee, ankle and foot
Prosthesis
-Severely shortened/absent femoral shaft

-Irregularly ossified tuft of bone proximal to the distal femoral epiphysis

-Severely dystrophic acetabulum

-Knee hypoplasia
Proximal Focal Femoral Deficiency-Aitken Class D
-Proximal Focal Femoral Deficiency

-Coxa Vera
 
-Short bowed femur
follow up examination of shortened right leg.
The patient is considered Aitken Class D and not a candidate for limb lengthing.  The acetabulum is unformed secondary to absence of a femoral head.  Only a tuft of bone is appreciated proximal to the distal femoral metaphysis which is also severly hypoplastic resulting in a dysfunctional knee.
