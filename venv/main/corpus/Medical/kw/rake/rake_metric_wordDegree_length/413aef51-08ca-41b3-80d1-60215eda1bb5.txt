A trial of conservative non-operative management is the first choice in a young growing patient with the goal to prevent further damage to the underlying bone and prevent total chondral collapse, which may lead to severe osteoarthritis later in the patientâ€™s life.  Management may include activity modification, protected weight-bearing, and/or immobilization of the joint.  Surgical options remain for older patients (with less healing potential) or for persistently symptomatic joints in younger patients; the goal being to stimulate healing and bone growth while maintaining the stability of the bone and joint.  For intact lesions (typically younger patients), drilling, either retrograde or antegrade, is commonly performed with fairly high success rates.  Very painful hinged lesions (flap of chondral tissue) require pegs, screws, or pins for security and provide rapid pain relief.  Full-thickness lesions, where both bone and cartilage have eroded, are repaired using arthroscopic drilling, abrasion with a high-speed burr, or microfracturing using a pick.  All three techniques for full-thickeness tears recruit marrow elements to stimulate bone growth, but in so doing create a weak area that requires very limited activity for up to 12 months after the surgery.
A/P Radiograph:  Area of varied lucency on the lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle of the right knee; just inferior to this lesion, there is an area of opacity into the knee joint, suggesting chondral or osseous tissue.  Both lesions c/w OCD.  O/w there is normal mineralization/alignment.MRI (T1W):  Area of low signal intensity on the lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle; surrounding this area within the femur is an area of very low signal intensity c/w fluid; there is also evidence of edema within the lesion, which may suggest an unstable fragment.  There is evidence of mild cartilage thinning over the fragment but no tearing.  The OCD is therefore nondisplaced.
