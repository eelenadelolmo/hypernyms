Multiple areas consistent with acute stroke, in both cerebellar hemispheres.
"Palm Tree&#39; pattern of lflow voids, consistent with a gigantic developmental venous anomaly (DVA) in the posterior fossa draining to the left internal jugular vein.
Multiple acute infarcts, both cerebellar hemispheres
Gigantic DVA of posterior fossa
Differential diagnosis of the multiple stroke: embolic phenomena from heart or arterial source, arterial  dissection, trauma, extensive venous thrombosis with multiple branch involvement, drugs, sickle cell anaemia, thrombotic states, vasculitis, inflammatory, infectious and metabolic diseases.
Due to its dimensions, the present DVA could be confounded with a arterio-venous malformation (AVM).
48-year-old man presented to the Emergency Room with abrupt onset of ataxia of less than 24 hours.
The mechanisms leading to the bilateral cerebellar strokes in the present case were unknown. Potential common causes of stroke were ruled out. Infarcts involving either supratentorial structures or the cerebral trunk were absent. 

A DVA could be associated with stroke or haemorrhage if thrombosis or stenosis occurs, the reported risk being around 0.2%/year. However, in the present case no signs of hemodynamic impairment of the DVA were present.
