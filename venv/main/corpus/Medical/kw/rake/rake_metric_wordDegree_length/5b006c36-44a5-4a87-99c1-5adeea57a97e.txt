Texto: 
Systolic blood pressures were above 200 mmHg.
The "right visual problem" was actually a bilateral field cut (right homonymous hemianopsia).
Initial CT scan reveals hypodensities in temporal and occipital lobes highly suggestive of infarction in the left PCA distribution.
MRI coronal FLAIR and axial diffusion weighted imaging show high signal intensity in similar distribution- consistent with infarction.  Of note, ADC mapping images were not obtained.
MRA images show abrupt truncation at the origin of the left PCA, essentially affecting all brain parenchyma supplied by the left PCA.  Please refer to the vascular map of PCA distribution attached.
Posterior Cerebral Artery Infarction (left)
infarct
mass lesion with surrounding edema
contusion
resolving hematoma
focal infection with encephalitis
56 y/o WM with four day history of right eye visual problems, short-term memory loss, confusion, and headache.
Neurologic patients often describe their symptoms in very different way compared to medical professionals.  For example, this patient complained of "loss of vision in the right eye" - but actually had bilateral loss of vision in the right visual fields.  Patients with bitemporal hemianopsia describe "tunnel vision".
