3.)	Heel walk â€“ Completed with no pain. 
4.)	Squat: Rt knee pain with LBP
5.)	Motor/Muscle Strength: +5 LE bilaterally
6.)	Straight Leg Test: Negative. At 45 angle, LBP w/o radiation to knee on left. At 45 angle, localized right knee pain.
7.)	HIP movements - active ROM 
a.	Extension: R 15 degrees; L 20 degrees
b.	Internal Rotation : R 25 degrees; L 35 degrees
c.	External Rotation: R 10 degrees; L  15 degrees 
d.	Adduction: R 25 degrees; L 35 degrees 
e.	Abduction R 20 degrees; L 20 degrees 
8.)	KNEE movements - active ROM 
a.	Flexion : R 80 degrees; L 65 degrees
9.)	With the pt lying on back supine, with the hip flexed to 90 degrees and the knee flexed to 90 degrees the left left hip could be internally rotated to 0 degrees and right hip was internally rotated to 15 degrees. 
10.) With the patient seated and the hip at 90 degrees and the knee at 90 degrees, internal rotation of the right hip could be accomplished to 5 degrees. In the same position the left hip was internally rotated to 15 degrees. In the same position for external rotation, the right hip could be externally rotated to 20 degrees and the left hip could be externally rotated to 25 degrees. 


INDICES:
1.) With regard to the Index of Severity for Hip Osteoarthritis from "Semin. Arthritis Rheum" (1991,) patient scored an 18 out of a possible 24. This index scaled assesses discomfort during nocturnal rest, presence of morning stiffness, presence of stiffness after standing for 30min or after walking, and for the presence of stiffness with prolonged standing. It further assesses the maximum distance walked, if there is pain with certain activities such as household chores and intercourse. 

2.) Based on the Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale from "Spine" (1995; 20:341-352,) patient scored a 62. This scale assesses the level of pain that same day.

3.) Based on the Pain Disability Questionnaire also from "Spine" (2004; 20:2290-2302,) patient had completed and scored a 72 in the functional area and a 53 in the psychosocial area, giving her a combined score of 125 out of a possible 150.
It would be recommended to the patient that since she has already tried cortisone injections and physical therapy with not much relief and is currently relying on pain medications to get through the day, she may want to consider this to be an appropriate time to speak with an experienced orthopedic surgeon. This patient remains to be a good surgical candidate, as she does not have any other comorbities  and does not have existing degenerative disease. Literature has shown that athletes with either type of FAI (pincer vs. CAM) had regained over 75% of their pre-injury activity level after an open surgical dislocation or an arthroscopic procedure. However, it has been studied that an open procedure involves more complications related to trochanteric osteotomy, while the mini-open approaches had considerable lateral femoral cutaneous nerve injury. With this being said, it is suggested that an arthroscopic approach be considered, as this will decrease both post-op recovery time and infection. The patient should be encouraged to engage in a dedicated physical therapy program soon after surgery for adequate and effective rehabilitation. This patient has no past medical history that would put her at risk for a procedure like this and will ultimately lead to satisfaction (1,2,3.)

XRAY findings :
Pincer Impingement
â€¢Global overcoverage of the femoral head
  oDeep acetabulum 
  oCoxa profunda 
  oFossa acetabula
  oAcetabular Index â€“ Decreased (negative) 
     MRI can also contribute.  
â€¢No evidence of focal 
  oLack of abnormal acetabular rims 
â€¢Anterior rim is not lateral 
â€¢No evidence of CAM impingement
  oNo pistol grip deformity/osseus bumps 
  oFemoral head is not aspherical 
â€¢OA evidence 
o	Loss of joint space (supero-lateral) 
o	Osteophyte formation 
o	Subchondral sclerosis
o	No cyst formation 
â€¢ENTHESITIS â€“ INFLAMMATION OF WHERE BONES/TENDONS ATTACH LEADING TO CALCIFICATION DEVELOPMENT AND FIBROSIS
â€¢It would appear that she has developmental annomalies about the hips bilaterally with extensive over coverage of the femoral head.  She also has findings consistent with osteophytic reaction to microtrauma and osteoarthrosis.  These findings as noted are contributory to FAI.
Femoroacetabular Impingement - Pincer Type
Differential Diagnosis: 
â€¢	Low Back Facet Disease â€“ No evidence of spinal stenosis seen in lumbar area of spine, even though has a history of trauma, which is a risk factor for facet arthropathy
â€¢	Hip Dysplasia (Adult form) â€“ Does not present with popping of hip or limping. Acetabulum on radiograph does not portray a shallow socket. 
â€¢	Sequelae of childhood disease â€“ no history of SCFE or childhood hip dysplasia
â€¢	Femoral neck stress fracture â€“ No pain on single leg standing and no antalgic gait on physical exam.  No fracture noted on radiograph 
â€¢	Osteonecrosis, avascular necrosisâ€“ No evidence of medical steroid use or excessive alcohol use , no history of sickle cell anemia. There is groin pain, but on radiograph, no sclerosis or subarticular radioluceny (crescent sign) seen. 
â€¢	Inflammatory Disease â€“ no evidence of gout, rheumatoid arthritis, lyme disease
42 year old African American female complaining of difficulty and pain with spreading her legs a part. She noticed the decreased range of motion with her legs since her mid 30s, and this is also when she had an onset of lower, middle back pain. She is notes that the pain and stiffness has become more apparent and uncomfortable since her involvement in a MVA eight months ago in 6/2014. The patient states that she was seat-belted passenger. She experienced whiplash with this accident, but denied any fractures or other injuries. She did not go to the hospital for medical care.

Her current condition causes her to be unable to sit in one position for prolonged periods of time. Patient notes that she has trouble balancing when walking and often needs to rest after traveling even a few blocks. She further mentions that with walking, she experiences a locking-type of a feeling on both sides of her hips. She is no longer able to exercise due to the dull pain in her lower back, which does not radiate anywhere. She also reports that she has trouble lifting and carrying things, and the most she can carry without feeling unease is about 5 pounds. Patient is currently using Trazodone as a muscle relaxant and Lortab as pain management, which she has gotten from her hand surgeon in 12/14 post surgical repair of a Madelung Deformity of her left upper extremity.  Massage therapy has been tried in the past, but patient is planning to return to physical therapy within the month.  Cortisone injection in 9/2014 did produce symptom benefit. 

Notes that sexual relationships have been compromised due to the fact that she has had difficulty in opening legs, which is the main reason for her to seek treatment. 

Patient denies loss of bowel/bladder habit and states she has normal sensation throughout. Reports poor sleep due to not being able to get comfortable with positioning. No recent illnesses, but notes she has experienced weight gain secondary to current sedentary lifestyle. She denies any history of childhood orthopedic conditions, previous traumas other than the 6/14 MVA, or previous fractures. 

INDICES:
In reference to the Indices of severity and disease activity for osteoarthritis (Semin Arthritis Rheum 1991,) patient scored an 18. 

In reference to the Pain and Disability Questionnaire (Spine 2004,) patient scored 72 in the functional area and 53 in the psychosocial area, giving a total of 125/150. Scores 131-150 put this patient in the "extreme" category for pain disability. 

In reference to the Quebec Back Pain Disability Score (Spine 1995,) patient scored a 62. A score of 0 indicates no limitation, whereas a score of 100 equals full limitation of activities.

There have been no studies to date that have found a correlation between FAI and Madelung"s Deformity, which is a failure of epiphyseal growth plate to fully develop. Madelung"s deformity commonly is bilateral and ends up causing an ulnar dislocation, thus compromising functionality (1.) The patient in this case just recently had surgery for Madelungâ€™s Deformity of the left arm and will be having the same for the right this upcoming year. It was thought that these two, uncommon boney abnormalities that occurred in the same patient may have some relationship, but no reports were found.
