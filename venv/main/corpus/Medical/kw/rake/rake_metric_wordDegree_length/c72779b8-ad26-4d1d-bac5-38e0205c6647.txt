This is a normal finding
F-18 FDG PET/CT images demonstrate bilateral symmetric hypermetabolism in the supraclavicular region which on CT scan correlates with low attenuation areas consistent with fat.
Supraclavicular Brown Fat
-Supraclavicular Lymph node metastasis
-Benign uptake in muscle due to tension
-Benign supraclavicular brown fat metabolism
55 year old female patient with a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. F-18 FDG PET/CT scan for staging/evaluation.
The ability to recognize brown fat hypermetabolism is critical in evaluating PET scans. This is a normal finding and should not be confused with metastatic disease.
