Surgical repair of the hernia is advocated for symptomatic patients.  If obstruction and strangulation of the stomach and esophagus occur, emergent surgery is indicated.  Since the rates of morbidity and mortality are so high for a gastric volvulus, some surgeons advocate elective surgery for asymptomatic patients.  Symptoms of a gastric volvulus include severe chest pain, retching with the inability to vomit, and the inability to pass a nasogastric tube.  This constellation of symptoms is known as Borchardt’s triad.
The PA and Lateral Chest radiographs show intrathoracic stomach and bowel.

The axial CT image through the chest shows the esophagus, the gastric fundus, and a loop of bowel within the thoracic cavity.  These findings are consistent with a Type 4 paraesophageal hernia.

A barium esophagram demonstrates a tortuous esophagus that deviates to the left just below the aortic arch.  The esophagogastric junction projects to the left of midline with a large paraesophageal hiatal hernia which includes the stomach.  The pyloric channel of the stomach projects below the level of the diaphragms.  The mucosa of the esophagus and stomach are normal with no evidence of ulceration or neoplastic change.
Gastric Organoaxial Rotation with Type 4 Paraesophageal Hernia
There are four types of paraesophageal hernias:

Type 1:  Sliding hiatal hernia with esophagogastric  junction displaced into the thorax.

Type 2:  Shows fundus or other portions of the stomach herniated into the chest while the esophagogastric junction remains in normal position at the level of the hiatus.

Type 3:  Compound or mixed hiatal hernia which shows displacement of the esophagogastric junction, gastric fundus, and body into the chest.
	
Type 4:  Not universally recognized since some authors consider it to be a variant of type 3 paraesophageal hernias. It is defined as a type 3 paraesophageal hernia with additional herniation of viscera such as the small or large bowel.

The patient presented complaining of solid food dysphagia and a prior EGD showing a dilated esophagus.
This patient presented complaining of dysphagia.  Typically, true dysphagia is not a presenting symptom with these types of hernias.  Reflux symptoms are also uncommon with these types of hernias.  As the disease progresses, food and air may distend the herniated gastric segment which causes discomfort and chest pain that is most prominent after a meal.  Belching and vomiting usually lessen the discomfort.  With even larger herniations, patients may even complain of difficulty breathing which is most noticeable after eating. 

This patient’s paraesophageal hernia and organoaxial rotation were initially supported by her chest x-ray.  A single fluid level within the mediastinum with the patient in the upright position can often indicate a hiatal hernia while seeing two air fluid levels strongly suggests an intrathoracic stomach with organoaxial or mesenteroaxial rotation.

This patient’s stomach was in an organoaxial rotation.  This means that the stomach rotated around an axis that connects the esophagogastric junction  and the pylorus.  This is the most common type of gastric rotation in both children and adults.  This type of rotation is usually associated with diaphragmatic defects such as the paraesophageal hernia seen in this case.  The second type of gastric rotation is referred to as a mesenteroaxial rotation.  Mesenteroaxial rotations occur when the antrum rotates anteriorly and superiorly along an axis that bisects both the lesser and greater curvatures of the stomach.  Patients with this type of gastric rotation usually present without diaphragmatic defects and usually have chronic symptoms.  The final type of gastric rotation combines both the organoaxial and mesenteroaxial forms.  This is very rare and is usually observed in patients with chronic volvulus.  A gastric rotation is defined as a gastric volvulus when the abnormal rotation has led to obstruction and strangulation.  Therefore, the patient in this case has a gastric rotation with the possibility of developing a gastric volvulus.
