She was initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics which consisted of Ciprofloxacin 400mg IV q12 Vancomycin 1000mg q12 Metronidazole 500mg IV q6.  She had drainage and culture of the abscess by Interventional Radiology, were they removed 60 ml of purulent fluid.  Pt culture grew Fusobacterium species so her antibiotics were switched to ertapenem 1gm IV daily.  

She was discharged from the hospital with a PICC line to continue IV antibiotics for 6 weeks; and, with a drain tube in place per IR recommendation.  The drain was removed two weeks later.  Pt also had a TEE because of her new murmur, which was negative.
• CT: CT images at 5 mm collimation were obtained with
 oral and intravenous contrast material. 
-The findings most compatible with L5-S1 discitis/osteomyelitis with superior S1 endplate osteolysis.  Slight widening of the L5- S1 intervertebral disc space.  There is a presacral rim enhancing fluid collection measuring a 6.1 x 4.2 x 8.8 cm, measuring in the AP, transverse and craniocaudal dimensions, respectively.  This fluid collection spans from the level of the mid L5 vertebral body to the level of inferior S3 vertebral body. 
 -There are multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine with vacuum disk phenomenon at L3 -- L4 and mild disc space narrowing at this level.

• MRI:IMPRESSION:
 
-Diskitis osteomyelitis at L5-S1 with large prevertebral fluid collection 
consistent with abscess. 
 
-Intermediate signal intensity in the anterior epidural space versus within epidural venous plexus L5 to S1.  This could represent a small subdural abscess versus phlegmonous change; differential  within epidural venous plexus.

62 y/o woman presented to the ED with progressively worsening back pain for six weeks. She remembers straining her back when she was gardening. She treated herself with motrin, but because of a planned shoulder surgery went to her PCM (knowing she’d have to stop the NSAIDs) and was switched to Percocet which seemed to help. Her shoulder surgery went well, but she notes worsening back pain ever since then especially over the last two weeks.
She went to the ED multiple times for severe pain and at least once three weeks ago she was noted to have fever of 102 as well as an elevated ESR (105). She was presumptively diagnosed with PMR and started on prednisone and referred to Rheumatology. She was seen by both family medicine and Rheumatology who agreed she likely did not have PMR and the steroids were discontinued, however she continued to have progressive lower back pain now with intermittent radicular symptoms. An MRI was ordered to be done routinely as an outpatient. She denies weakness, saddle anesthesia, fecal or urinary incontinence, rashes, joint pain, or n/v/d.
This case is unique because of the bacterial cause of her osteomyelitis. Patients abscess was cultured and shown to grow Fusobacterium spp. Fusobacterium is a Gram-negative, nonmotile non-sporeforming, obligate anaerobic rods belonging to the family Bacteroidacecae. According to some journals there has been only 12 cases of Fusobacteria causing diskitis in medical literature.  Factors associated with fusobacterial infection include disruption of the normal cutaneous and mucocutaneous barriers, tissue injury, and impaired blood supply leading to hypoxia. A previous ear–nose–throat (ENT) infection or maxillofacial problem was found in the majority of the patients (n=8, 73%) without any other identified portal of entry. This pt did not have any oral associated procedures or infection but she did have shoulder surgery which during anesthesia may have disrupted normal mucocutaneous barrier.  Pt did also complain of mild back pain before her shoulder surgery.  The clinical and radiological presentations for osteomyletis caused by Fusobacterium include localized pain and classical signs of vertebral osteomyelitis. Back pain and fever were present for a majority of patients (n=10, 91%). Back pain was present in our pt and at least one episode of fever along with radicular pain. Thirty years ago, almost all Fusobacteria were susceptible to metronidazole, penicillin G, clindamycin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol but were resistant to vancomycin, aminoglycosid and erythromycin. Recently, increasing numbers of strains have been found to be resistant to some of these drugs, in particular to B-lactam by enzymatic production. Fusobacteria vertebral osteomylitis does not seem to increase the length of antiobiotic treatment.   Fusobacteria species causing vertebral osteomyelitis seems to be extremely uncommon. Nevertheless the diagnosis might be underestimated because of difficulties to isolate these bacteria. These bacteria should be considered when the infection does not respond to standard therapy.
