B/L breast prostheses.
Mild tenderness to palpation at/above right knee.
No further radiographic analysis required.
Tc99m-MDP Bone Scan (25.0 mCi IV): Intense radiotracer uptake in the distal right femur involving medial and lateral condyles anteriorly and posteriorly.  No involvment of proximal right tibia.  Breast prosthesis attenuation artifact.  Plain films recommended.

Plain Films:  Expansion of the distal femoral cortex with coarsened trabecular markings.  (No osteoblastic regions identified.)
Paget's disease
Bone Scan:  Paget's disease, fibrous dysplasia, less likely metastatic disease.

Plain films:  Paget's disease (no radiographic evidence of extremely unlikely concurrent breast cancer recurrence).
66 y/o AAF s/p MRM 1995 for breast cancer.  Presents for bone scan to r/o recurrence.
