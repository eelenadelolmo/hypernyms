Texto: 
•Moderately obese African American female

•Breasts symmetrical, no obvious deformities/abnormalities

•No masses or lymphadenopathy

•Able to express discharge from a single duct with breast milking

•Previous Screening Mammogram (NOV 2009) within normal limits

    -Asymptomatic at time of screening mammogram
Though findings are most consistent with intraductal papilloma, definitive diagnosis requires resection with pathologic confirmation.
•5 mm lobulated filling defect approx. 1.3 cm from nipple orifice at ductal bifurcation, most notable on Mag CC Ductogram of R breast
•Mild duct ectasia noted on both MLO and CC views
Abnormal Nipple Discharge - probable intraductal papilloma
•Papilloma
•Intraductal Hyperplasia
•Intraductal Malignancy
48 y/o AA female presents with several week h/o “coffee-colored” discharge from her R breast

     • Described as spontaneous, often noted in her bra at the end of the day

     • Denies prior h/o abnormal breast discharge

     • Denies pain, masses, or prior h/o malignancy

     • Admits to FHx of breast CA
With abnormal nipple discharge, you may want to consider obtaining Hemoccult and Cytology of the discharge.  Concern for intraductal pathology is often evaluated with Galactography (Ductogram).  Several possible findings include: 
•Lobulated filling defect suggestive of papilloma
•Multiple continuous filling defects suggestive of papillomatosis
 •Ductal obstruction and/or irregular duct walls suspicious for malignancy

In the case of this patient, findings and history are most consistent with intraductal papilloma, though pathologic confirmation is still required.
