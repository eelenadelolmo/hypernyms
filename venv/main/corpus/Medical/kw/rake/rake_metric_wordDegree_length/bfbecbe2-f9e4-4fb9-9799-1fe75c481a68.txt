Texto: 
Patient is intubated and immobilized with multiple pelvic and spinal fractures.  Labs are remarkable for hematuria.
Extraperitoneal bladder rupture is treated nonsurgically.  Suprapubic and Foley catheters were left in place.
Images through the bladder following instillation of 350 cc of dilute Omnipaque through the patient's Foley catheter demonstrates rupture of the inferior bladder wall with extravasation of contrast material into the pelvis.  This is consistent with an extraperitoneal bladder rupture.
Bladder Rupture
intraperitoneal bladder rupture
extraperitoneal bladder rupture
22-year old active duty male status post helicopter crash with multiple pelvic and spinal fractures.
The most common type of bladder injury is extraperitoneal bladder rupture accounting for 80-90% of cases.  It is most commonly caused by penetrating trauma.  In blunt trauma, laceration by bone fragments from associated pelvic fractures is thought to be the cause.  This patient sustained an extraperitoneal bladder rupture likely from this mechanism given his extensive associated pelvic fractures and other injuries.  In simple extraperitoneal bladder ruptures, extravasation is limited to the perivesical space, as in this case.  Extraperitoneal bladder rupture is treated nonsurgically
and can be managed by catheter drainage, antibiotics, and clinical observation.
