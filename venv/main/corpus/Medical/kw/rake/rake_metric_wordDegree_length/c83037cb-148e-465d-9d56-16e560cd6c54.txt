Treatment/Followup:  Patient underwent angiography and subsequent aneurysm clipping.
Noncontrast CT of the Head:  Increased attenuation in the anterior interhemispheric fissure.

MR:  Focal area of enlargement of the flow void in the region of the anterior interhemispheric fissure suspicious for aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery.

MRA:  Demontrates 7 mm aneurysmal dilatation of the anterior communicating artery.  Also identified was diffuse contour irregularity of the distal MCA and posterior circulation suggestive of intracranial atherosclerosis.

Ruptured 7 mm Anterior Communicating Artery Aneurysm

66 year old with the worst headache of his life presents to the emergency department.
The hallmark of imaging in an acute subarachnoid hemorrhage is the high attenuation within the CSF spaces.  The initial CT read was negative but in retrospect, the obscuration of the anterior interhemispheric fissure was the crucial imaging finding.  Since the neurological symptoms were not explained by CT, an MRI/MRA was subsequently performed which made the diagnosis.  

Major landmarks to evaluate for subarachnoid hemorrhage include the basilar cisterns such as the suprasellar cistern, quadrigeminal plate cistern, sulci, and sylvian fissure.
