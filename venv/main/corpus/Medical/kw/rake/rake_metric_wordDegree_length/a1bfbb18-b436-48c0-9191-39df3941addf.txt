Texto: 
Tender along the right zygomatic arch. 
Periorbital ecchimosis.
EOM intact.
Forced duction testing should be performed to ensure there is not restricted movement of the extraocular muscles. The globe is moved manually - resistance implies entrapment of the associated contralateral muscle.  For example, if superior movement is restricted, the inferior rectus muscle may be entraped and surgical exploration should be performed.
Fracture of the inferior and medial orbital wall with herniation of conal fat and movement of inferior rectus muscle to the edge of the fracture, but no evident entrapment.  Soft tissue density layering in dependent right maxillary sinus is consistent with blood. Air is present within the right nasolacrimal duct. No acute intracranial injury. Degenerative changes of the upper cervical spine.
Blowout Fracture of the Orbit
Blowout fracture of the orbit.
48 year-old man status post assault by a relative.  No reported loss of consciousness.
