Urinalysis negative.
None required.
Fluoroscopic images demonstrate a duplicated right renal collecting system.  Both the upper and lower pole ureters are of normal caliber and insert on the base of the urinary bladder without evidence of obstructive uropathy.  Both kidneys enhance promptly and symmetrically without renal mantle thinning or focal masses.

Duplicated Renal Collecting System
21-year-old female with history of right ureteral reimplantation at eight years of age for vesicoureteral reflux has incontinence and recurrent urinary tract infections.
This patient is status post surgical reimplantation of the right lower pole ureter to correct vesicoureteral reflux.  According to the Weigert-Meyer rule, the upper pole ureter will insert ectopically, inferior and medial to the normal (orthotopic) location.  It is this ectopic ureter that is prone to having a ureterocele which may result in obstruction.  The lower pole ureter inserts orthotopically but is prone to vesicoureteral reflux, which predisposes the patient for pyleonephritis.
