Texto: 
A large palpable mass of the right leg is noted just inferior to the knee joint, and along the medial border of the tibia.  The remainder of the exam was non-contributory.
Above knee amputation (AKA) of the right leg was performed due to the extent of the tumor mass.  CT of the chest showed pulmonary nodule consistent with metastasis to the lung.  Radiation and chemotherapy were initiated.
Plain AP and lateral radiographs of the right tibia and fibula demonstrate a permeative lytic lesion of the proximal tibia with a ‚Äúmoth-eaten‚Äù appearance.  On lateral plain film a wide zone of transition and cortical disruption is appreciated, which is consistent with an aggressive lesion.  There is also a periosteal reaction with an ‚Äúonion-skin‚Äù appearance visible at the edges of the cortical disruption.  

CT findings demonstrate the cortical disruption in detail with aggressive periosteal reaction.  MRI findings best depict marrow replacement with a large enhancing mass with substantial surrounding soft tissue component.

20 y.o. man presents to primary care physician with complaint of right knee pain and swelling.  The patient has no significant medical history or recent injuries.
Ewing sarcoma is most commonly seen between the ages of 4 and 15 years old.  This patient is slightly above the average expected age, but is still young enough that this neoplasm is a reasonable consideration when a lytic lesion is seen in a bone.    

The most commonly involved bones in Ewing sarcoma are the bones of the chest wall, pelvis and lower extremities.  Within the bone the diaphysis is the most common site of Ewing sarcoma.  This patient presents with a tumor consistent with Ewing sarcoma.  However, this site would also be consistent with osteosarcoma or a metastatic mass, which can also be seen in a patient in this age group.

Histology demonstrating a primitive, high grade tumor is a poor prognostic indicator for this patient.  The fact that there is possible metastasis to the lung, as evidenced by pulmonary nodules, is also a poor prognostic indicator in this patient.
