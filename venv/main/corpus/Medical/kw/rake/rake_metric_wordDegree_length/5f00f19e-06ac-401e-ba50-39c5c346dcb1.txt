Rapid development of dropping hematocrit.
Patient undergoing continued ICU support at the time of case compilation.  The standard treatment for retinoic acid syndrome is 10mg dexamethasone IV q12 hours for a minimum of 3 days (Nicolls, 1305).
An AP portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates asymmetric, bilateral, diffuse hazy alveolar consolidation pattern later shown with bronchoscopy to be the result of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.  A dual lumen endotracheal tube is present with its distal segment in the left main pulmonary bronchus.  Axial CT image of the chest of the same patient demonstrating ground glass air space filling pattern attributed to intra-alveolar blood as discussed above.
Pulmonary hemorrhage.
The differential diagnosis of pulmonary hemorrhage includes: spontaneous (thrombocytopenia, hemophilia, anticoagulation therapy), trauma (such as pulmonary contusion), embolic disease (pulmonary embolism, fat embolism), vasculidites (autoimmune such as Goodpasture’s, Idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage, and Wegener’s granulomatosis and infectious such as gram negative bacteria, influenza, aspergillus, and mucormycosis), and drugs (for example, pencillamine) (Brant and Helms, 368).
Patient with known acute promyelocytic leukemia presents with acute onset hemoptysis.
