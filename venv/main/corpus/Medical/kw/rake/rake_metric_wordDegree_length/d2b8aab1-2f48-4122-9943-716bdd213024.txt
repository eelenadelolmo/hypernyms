Physical examination 3 weeks post MVA:

The patient is 5 foot 6 inches tall and weighs 206 pounds.  Blood pressure of the left arm in the seated position is 144/88 mmHg.

Ranges of motion were measured by Dual Inclinometry.  Findings were compared to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù from The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment 5th Edition.  Active range of motion of the cervical spine revealed flexion to be accomplished to 36¬∞/50¬∞, left rotation to 60¬∞/80¬∞, right rotation to 60¬∞/80¬∞, left lateral bending to 33¬∞/45¬∞, right lateral bending to 40¬∞/45¬∞ and extension to 41¬∞/60¬∞.  She reported right cervicothoracic pain and discomfort during flexion, left rotation, right rotation, and extension.  The bicep and tricep reflexes were graded 2/4 bilaterally.  Cervical distraction was unremarkable.  Cervical compression testing produced reported neck pain that radiated to the right shoulder.  Active range of motion of the shoulders was within normal limits.  Muscle strengths of the upper extremities revealed such to be of essentially normal strength.  However when the deltoid muscles were tested she reported right cervicothoracic pain.  Grip strength was tested using a Jamar dynamometer.  The right hand tested to 50 pounds and the left hand tested to 65 pounds.  She reports being right hand dominant.

Active range of motion of the lumbar spine revealed flexion to be accomplished to 52¬∞/60¬∞, left lateral bending to 12¬∞/25¬∞, right lateral bending to 11¬∞/25¬∞ and extension to 8¬∞/25¬∞.  She reported right lower back pain during right lateral bending and extension.  The subpatellar and Achilles reflexes were graded 2/4 bilaterally.  She was able to arise onto her toes and the static position but was unable to walk.  She was able to arise onto her heels and walk on her heels.  When she attempted the squat she noted right knee pain.  The straight leg raise could be accomplished to 53¬∞ on the right with report of lower back and right lower extremity pain extending to the calf.  The straight leg raise could be accomplished to 80¬∞ on the left without report of lower back or lower extremity pain.  Muscle strengths of the extensor and flexor halluces revealed a weakness of the left flexor hallucis graded 4/5.  Neer‚Äôs testing revealed the right shoulder could be elevated to 140¬∞ with report of right shoulder pain.  The Hawkins-Kennedy and supraspinatus procedures were positive on the right side.  Such testing was unremarkable on the left.  The valgus/varus stress testing, AP drawer procedures, McMurray‚Äôs test and Lachman‚Äôs procedures were unremarkable.  The patellar grind procedure was positive on the right side.  

Posterior to anterior compression produced reported pain over the left lumbosacral region.  Hypomobility was noted at the lumbosacral regions.  Muscle spasm was noted over the lumbosacral regions paraspinally. Pain/tenderness, asymmetry/misalignment, abnormal range of motion, and tissue/tone changes were associated with the areas of hypomobility. Deep palpation produced reported pain over the right buttock.


Focused examination 5 months post MVA:
Vitals: Afebrile.  Normotensive.  Normal sinus rhythm.  Respiratory rate WNL.

Joints of the lower extremities show no gross deformity or abnormality.  Mild right suprapatellar effusion.   Right lateral knee joint line tenderness.  Mild crepitus with patellar motion.  Decreased active extension of the right knee due to pain with intact passive range of motion bilaterally. Valgus/varus stress testing, AP drawer procedures, McMurray‚Äôs test, and Lachman‚Äôs procedures were unremarkable.  Patellar grind procedure was positive on the right.  Patient walks with antalgic gait slightly favoring the left.  Patient is able to squat but complains of right knee pain.  Straight leg raise test is negative bilaterally.  Sensation, proprioception, and nociception are intact bilaterally.  Patellar and Achilles reflexes 2/4 bilaterally.

PT/INR and PTT were within normal limits.
The patient went to the hospital for numbness and pain of the right lower extremity and foot 3 months post-MVA.  Pulses could not be elicited in the right foot.  Doppler did not demonstrate blood flow in the right foot.  Ultrasound-guided access of the left common femoral artery followed by aortogram followed by selective right lower extremity angiogram first, second and third order catheterization was performed.  Initiation of thrombolysis for occluded popliteal artery.    The patient was referred to an orthopedic surgeon whose emphasis includes the knee for the osteochondritis.   She has not gone to the orthopedic surgeon as of yet for evaluation.  The patient performed RICE therapy. Chiropractic manipulative therapy for areas of spinal complaint.

Lower limb ischemia that occurred 3 months post-MVA
56-year-old female with past medical history of LBP, DM2, HLD, and HTN presents with right knee pain with vague descriptions of instability and ‚Äúgiving out‚Äù since striking her knee in an MVA four months ago as an unrestrained backseat passenger.   She denies sensation of joint locking or catching.  ED evaluation the morning after the incident demonstrated normal findings on plain films of the knee and lumbar spine and the patient was discharged instructed to ice the sore areas.  One month ago, the patient had a three-day worsening cold painful right leg and right foot with decreased motion of the toes.  She reports seeking treatment at the ED.  She was started on heparin for thrombolysis and underwent catheterization and arteriography which demonstrated a patent aortoiliac system, bilateral slow runoff of the lower extremities, and occlusive thrombosis of the right popliteal, distal anterior tibial, posterior tibial and peroneal arteries.  She denies history of thrombosis, arrhythmia, coagulopathy, or bleeding diathesis.  Current medications include acetaminophen and apixaban.  Patient ceased tobacco and alcohol use 5-7 years ago.

The two most significant findings in this patient‚Äôs workup include: The osteochondral defect on the surface of the anterior lateral condyle with discontinuity in the femoral articular surface.  The other is right lower extremity ischemia, and associated arteriography indicating occlusive thrombosis.  

The various conditions that present with such a finding listed in the differential diagnosis are often referred to with the nonspecific term of osteochondral defect, which reflects the unclear etiology of more specific terminology.  From the information provided, we are sufficiently able to assess the underlying pathologic process and provide adequate treatment and referral for this patient.

The temporal factors in this case of sudden onset and persistence after trauma are more typical of a post-traumatic osteonecrotic process, such as secondary osteonecrosis, but the MRI findings are more consistent with osteochondritis, which may more likely than not, based on location (see topic), not progress to end-phase osteonecrotic fragment.  There was no original subchondral bone fracture or disruption detected on two sets of plain film radiographs, further decreasing the likelihood of a pre-existing condition to the MVA.  The pattern of mild subchondral bone and marrow signal with four months of symptoms is more consistent with osteochondritis dissecans.  In light of the sudden onset of symptoms after trauma, a single femoral condylar lesion, and absence of other predisposing factors (corticosteroids, alcohol, tobacco, SLE, sickle cell, caisson disease, Gaucher‚Äôs disease, thrombophilia, or hypofibrinolysis), spontaneous osteonecrosis is also less likely.  The location of the lesion is less typical for osteochondritis dissecans, but the lateral femoral condyle is the second-most common location.  

The contribution of the episode of acute limb ischemia with popliteal artery thrombosis could have decreased flow through the anterior tibial recurrent artery, but the abundant collateral circulation of the knee joint would likely maintain perfusion of the joint.  It is unlikely that this ischemic event produced the findings in this case, which corresponds more with the trauma to the knee.  It is possible that the patient had preexisting osteochondritis dissecans, which can be asymptomatic in earlier stages when the articular lesion is stable, but the patient‚Äôs age, location of the lesion, and timing of symptoms makes this less likely.

The MRI finding in this case is consistent with a single stage IIa (out of IV) osteochondral lesion, which portends a likely recovery.  If there is failure to improve, repeat imaging would likely be necessary to evaluate the osteochondritic lesion relative to  progression.  Arthroscopy also becomes a consideration.
