-6 x 6 cm cervical mass with infiltrated surrounding fat, consistent with cervical cancer.  
-There are several prominent asymmetric pelvic lymph nodes on the left side.  These are not pathologic by size criteria, however, in the presence of nearby malignancy these may represent metastatic disease.  
-There is mild bilateral hydronephrosis from the cervical mass compressing both ureters.  Additionally, the image through the kidneys demonstrates delayed nephrogram of the right kidney secondary to higher back pressure of the right hydronephrosis compared with the left.
