Texto: 
Physical examination demonstrated a mild sensory deficit in the left thenar eminence and a MMSE score of 29/30.

A head CT was ordered to rule out a mass lesion.
The patient completed a 2 week course of albendazole and a 1 week course of dexamethasone.  Follow up MRI one month later showed improvement of the edema surrounding the cyst.  The cyst remained unchanged from previous studies.  The patient had no further seizures or neurological symptoms at her 1 month follow up
CT w/o and w/Contrast: 
A 1 cm low attenuation lesion with a relatively high attenuation ring is present in the high right parietal area that enhances brightly around the rim and in the regions of calcification status-post contrast administration.  A moderate amount of perilesional edema is present without evidence of a midline shift.   
          
MRI w/o and w/Contrast:
A 1cm ring-enhancing mass with a high density nodule within the cyst is present in the high right parietal lobe.  There is a moderate amount of surrounding edema without evidence of a midline shift.  FLAIR imaging suppressed the intracystic fluid allowing visualization of the scolex.
Neurocysticercosis
â€¢ Neurocysticercosis or other parasitic infection
â€¢ Abscess
â€¢ Tuberculosis
â€¢ "Cystic" Neoplasm
â€¢ Arachnoid Cyst
A 14 year old Latina girl presents with a 2 week history of bilateral arm numbness and a new onset partial seizure that transitioned to a tonic-clonic seizure.
