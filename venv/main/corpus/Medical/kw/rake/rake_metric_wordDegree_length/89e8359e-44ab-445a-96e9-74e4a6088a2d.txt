Tophaceous Gout
Tophaceous Gout
Soft tissue sarcoma
58 year old man with growing soft tissue mass along the lower aspect of his leg. He states it is beginning to rub on the back of his shoes and is bothersome.
Tophus generally comprise a lobulated soft-tissue mass which is comprised of crystalline/amorphous urates surrounded by highly vascularized inflammatory tissue rich in histiocytes, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, foreign-body giant cells. (Similar to a foreign-body granuloma).
