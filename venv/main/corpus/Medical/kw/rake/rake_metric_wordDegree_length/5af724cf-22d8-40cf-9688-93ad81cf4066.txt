Texto: 
Patient is well-appearing without any laboratory abnormalities.
Patient underwent a left nephrectomy.
Dense heterogeneous fluid collection is seen within the left anterior perinephric space extending within, but confined to, Gerota's fascia. More cephalad scan shows a fat containing lesion closely related to the hematoma.  Multiple heterogeneous low density lesions are seen within the left renal parenchyma.  These lesions are well-circumscribed.  The Houndsfield unit measurement of portions of these lesions are less than -10 and are consistent with fat.

41-year old active duty male who fell while riding his bike.  Patient had left flank pain and was initially taken to an outside hospital where a CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed.
Angiomyolipomas are benign hamartomas composed of fatty tissue, blood vessels, and smooth muscle.  The majority of angiomyolipomas occur sporadically, and are typically seen in middle-aged patients.  The male:female ratio is 1:4.  There is an association with Tuberous Sclerosis, and up to 80% of all patients with tuberous sclerosis, to include adults and children, will have angiomyolipomas.  Patients with Tuberous Sclerosis will frequently have bilateral renal involvement.  

This patient did not have bilateral involvement, but did have extensive involvement of his left kidney with multiple lesions.  While most angiomyolipomas are asymptomatic, those greater than 4 cm can cause flank pain, hematuria, and anemia.  They also carry a significant risk of hemorrhage as occured in this case status post minor trauma.  Because of extensive involvement of the patient's left kidney and large hematoma, the surgical team decided to perform an elective nephrectomy.
