Surgical resection
broad-based or sessile lesion in the proximal sigmoid colon that has an irregular surface.  The overall appearance is that of a mucosal or potentially submucosal lesion.
tubulovillous adenoma
Given the frond-ish appearance of the surface, the diagnosis of exclusion is adenocarcinoma of the colon.  In the differential would remain an adenoma or hyperplastic polyp.  Potentially any of the submucosal lesions that arise from the wall could undergo ulceration or develop an irregular surface appearance -lipoma or leiomyoma.
26 y/o male with strong family history of colon cancer diagnosed in family members in their mid 30s presents for screening barium enema.
