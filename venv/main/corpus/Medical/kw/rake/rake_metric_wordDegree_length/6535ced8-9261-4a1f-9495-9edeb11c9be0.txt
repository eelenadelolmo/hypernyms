Recommendation was made for a 3 phase contrast enhanced CT of the kidneys.
Serial radiographs from the Urology Department demonstrate symmetric nephrogram enhancement with enlargement of the left kidney.  There is splaying of the renal calyces and infundibulum bilaterally.  There is no evidence of hydronephrosis and the course of the ureters are normal without filling defects or mucosal abnormalities.  There are phleboliths in the pelvis.

Review of ultrasound images demonstrate hypoechoic regions in the renal sinus without evidence of flow.
Spidery Collecting System
Renal Sinus Lipomatosis
Parapelvic cysts
Arteriovenous Malformation
Renal Artery Aneurysm
Neoplasm (Renal Cell Carcinoma, Lymphoma)
63 year old male with history of ultrasound for hypertension which demonstrated hydronephrosis from an outstide institution.  An IVU was obtained to evaluate for obstruction.
Ultrasound findings of renal sinus cysts (parapelvic cysts) can mimic hydronephrosis.  These cysts parallel the calyces and renal pelvis.  On IVU or contrast enhanced CT, the extraluminal location of the cysts are evident, as in this case.  There was no evidence of hydronephrosis.  Rather, there was a "spidery" appearance to the renal collecting system.  Based on the patient's history and sonographic findings, this is the most likely diagnosis and confirmation can be made with a three phase contrast enhanced CT of the kidneys.  This case illustrates a pitfall in identification of hydronephrosis on ultrasound.
