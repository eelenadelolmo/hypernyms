First presentation at 13 yrs, patient broke off a needle in third finger of right hand. He also had left knee pain, after a fall.

At age 16, he returned with pain of the left 3rd finger PIP joint.
Asymptomatic osteopoikilosis is discovered when evaluating the right third finger for a needle tip.  Fewer lesions were present in the left knee, predominantly periarticular. Most significant involvement was noted in the periarticular carpal bones of the left hand.  No lesions were identified on a cervical spine X-ray (not shown).
