General: A&OX3, Pale, cachectic female
HEENT: pale conjunctiva, PERRL, EOMI
Neck: Supple, no JVD, FROM
Heart: RRR, soft systolic murmur
Lungs: Clear to Auscultation
Abdomen: Flat abdomen with bowel sounds. TTP in the upper quadrants
Extremities: No edema, FROM
Neuro: No focal neurological deficits
GU: Guaiac positive

Labs: WBC: 4.8 Hb: 3.2 Hct: 10.3 Platelet: 184
Patient had a gastrojujenostomy because of ischemia and massive adhesions.

Two mesh from previous surgeries were also located.  These pieces of mesh were removed and may have contributed to this late presentation of internal hernia.

Subsequent  to this most recent surgery, the patient fully recovered and her abdominal pain resolved. The anemia present at the patient's initial presentation also resolved.
CT of Abdomen: 
1. Markedly distended stomach and proximal portion of the duodenum with abrupt decompression of the duodenum at the level of the third portion with swirling of mesenteric vessels. Recommend surgical consultation.
2. Multiple loops of fluid filled bowel within the right upper quadrant without discrete evidence of focal bowel wall thickening. 

Upper GI Series with contrast:
1. Delayed flow of contrast from the duodenal bulb into the proximal C-loop. Once this has occurred, there is an opacification of the proximal jejunal segments which are primarily located in the right upper quadrant.
Transmesenteric hernia (internal hernia), small bowel volvulus
•Mesenteric ischemia
•Enteritis
•Internal hernia with small bowel volvulus
• Adhesive bands
66 year old woman presents to the ED complaining of palpitation X 3 days and abdominal pain X 1-1.5 years. Patient was recently diagnosed with severe anemia and discharged 2 days prior to arrival from another hospital. Patient had a single episode of hematemesis in the ER. Denies CP/SOB/ Fever/ diarrhea/urinary symptoms/ melena/ hematochezia. 

PMH/PSH: Pyloric strictures status post 2 abdominal surgeries.

Social: Denies Alcohol, Smoking, Drugs

ROS: Recent weight loss approximately 35 pounds in last year
This case illustrates the importance of a thorough history and physical, including a surgical history, even if a surgery took place decades ago.
