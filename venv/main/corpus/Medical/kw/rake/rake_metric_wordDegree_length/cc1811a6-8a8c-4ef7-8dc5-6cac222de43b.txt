Gradually increasing abdominal distention over the past 12 hours.
The contrast enema did not demonstrate reflux of contrast into the terminal ileum.  At that time, the differential diagnosis was narrowed to include ileal stresia and severe meconium ileus.  Surgical intervention was subsequently performed, revealing a meconium ileus.  A large amount of inspissated meconium was removed from the terminal ileum, relieving the obstruction.  A sweat test conducted that week confirmed the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.
Figure #1: KUB: multiple dilated loops of bowel throughout the abdomen and no definite gas in the rectum, findings consistent with a distal obstruction.

Figure #2: Contrast enema: small-caliber microcolon without reflux of contrast into the terminal ileum.
Meconium Ileus
Low Intestinal Obstruction in Neonates:
-Hirschsprung disease
-Meconium plug syndrome
-Ileal atresia
-Meconium ileus
-Anal atresia

Low Intestinal Obstruction with Microcolon:
-Ileal atresia
-Meconium ileus
30 hr-old female with failure to pass meconium and abdominal distention.  Uneventful prenatal course and birth.
In meconium ileus, low intestinal obstruction results from the impaction of thick, tenacious meconium in the distal ileum, which cannot pass through the ileocecal valve.  Meconium is the material found in the intestine in a newborn. It is normally evacuated within 6 hours after birth, but can be passed in utero secondary to vagal response.

Meconium ileus usually presents with vomiting and abdominal distention in the newborn.  It may be complicated by volvulus, perforation, or peritonitis.

The condition is almost always a manifestation of cystic fibrosis.  Approximately 20% of infants with cystic fibrosis present with meconium ileus at birth, the earliest manifestation of the disease. 

Plain abdominal radiographs frequently demonstrate a low intestinal obstruction with multiple dilated loops of air-filled bowel. Air-fluid levels are often absent. In contrast, ileal atresia will often demonstrate air-fluid levels.  

Contrast enema is diagnostic, and often therapeutic in cases of meconium ileus.
This study typically demonstrates microcolon, indicating that meconium has not passed normally into the colon during fetal life.  When contrast agent refluxes into the small bowel the diagnosis of meconium ileus is established.  If contrast does not reflux into the terminal ileum, surgery is indicated for definitive diagnosis and treatment.
