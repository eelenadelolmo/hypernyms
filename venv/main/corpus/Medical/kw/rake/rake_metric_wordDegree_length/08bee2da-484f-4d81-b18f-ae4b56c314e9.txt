Unremarkable physical exam.  No labs.
No specific Radiological follow-up necessary.  Standard IUD follow-up appointments with Ob-Gyn.
Echogenic structure on ultrasound within the endometrium with dense posterior shadowing, which appears rounded on transverse views and linear on sagittal views.  Remainder of the study (not shown) is normal.

KUB confirms the presence of an IUD.
Intrauterine Device - Normal Ultrasound Appearance
IUD
Foreign Body
Calcification
36 year-old woman with questionable abnormality on outside CT.
An understanding of the appearance of IUDs will prevent unnecessary exams by radiologists and concern by patients.
