Texto: 
Tenderness to palpation at the lateral malleolus.
No treatment is required for a nonossifying fibroma as the lesion typyically ossifies as the patient enters adulthood.
AP and lateral images of the ankle demonstrate a cortical-based lucent lesion in the distal tibia.  This lesion has a narrow zone of transition, sclerotic margins, no calcification/matrix and no perioteal reaction
Nonossifying Fibroma
Xanthofibroma, Nonossifying fibroma, Benign fibrous cortical defect
13 y/o boy for evaluation of ankle sprain.
The location of this lesion (distal tibia) is one of the most common sites of occurence. These lesions are sometimes called fibroxanthomas or fibrous cortical defects (FCD). Some consider the NOF and FCD to be different entities, however. In this context, the NOF is described as a larger (>3 cm) lesion which is eccentrically located within the medullary cavity of the bone and abuts the cortex. They typically cause a superficial, scalloping pattern in the adjacent cortex. The FCD is a smaller (<3 cm) lesion that is asymptomatic and eccentrically located within the cortex (rather than the medullary cavity). Most FCD's spontaneously regress with time.
The characteristic appearance allows these to be designated in the "leave alone" lesion category by imaging appearance.
