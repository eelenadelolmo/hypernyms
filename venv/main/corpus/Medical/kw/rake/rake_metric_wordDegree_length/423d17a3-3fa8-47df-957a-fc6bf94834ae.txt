Texto: 
Decreased breath sounds on right chest.
No abnormal labs.
2 chest tube thoracotomies. Consideration for pleuradhesis, again.
Irregular but significant volume loss of most of right lung, with air density in the intra-pleural space.
Pneumothorax
hydropneumothorax.
hemopneumothorax.
Chest pain on climbing stairs. "Felt like before, when I had a collapsed lung".
This patient had had a pleuradhesis on the right side one year earlier, for presumed ruptured bleb. This is the etiology of the [incomplete and] irregular collapse of the lung and the thickened pleural surfaces.
