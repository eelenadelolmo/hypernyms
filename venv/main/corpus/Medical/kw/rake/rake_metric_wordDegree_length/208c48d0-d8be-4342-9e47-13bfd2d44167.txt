PE was unchanged from pre-op
Labs: BUN 21, Cr 2.9
The patient underwent a total nephrectomy of the L kidney and reimplantation of the R ureter into the bladder.
Ultrasound of the L kidney shows mild hydronephrosis and a 7.5 by 5.5 cm mass located in the lower pole of the kidney.

MRI: T1 axial image shows a low-intensity, homogenous mass within the L kidney that enhances with contrast and reveals a well-defined capsule.  T2 coronal section shows a high-intensity homogenous mass in the lower pole of the L kidney
Renal Oncocytoma
Renal Oncocytoma
Renal Cell Carcinoma
Angiomyolipoma
The patient was a 39 y/o female admitted for a laproscopic BSO.  On the night of surgery the patient became anuric and was noted to have an increasing BUN and creatinine.
Renal oncocytomas are very difficult to distinguish from renal cell carcinomas.  This patient had images that showed some features indicative of oncocytoma, but these cases are often considered renal cell carcinoma until proven otherwise.  As a result the treatment was resection of the tumor with diagnosed confirmed by tissue pathology.
