Texto: 
On physical examination, the patient&#8217;s thyroid gland is mildly enlarged, with a gland weight of approximately 45-50 grams.  The gland is firm and homogeneous in texture, without focal nodularity.

The patient&#8217;s most recent thyroid function tests reveal a free T4 of 1.40 (normal) and a TSH of <0.08 (low).  Her 4 hour radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) is 26%, and her 24 hour RAIU is 42%, (both elevated).
Thyroid scan performed with I-123 shows diffusely increased radiotracer uptake throughout the thyroid gland.  A focal nodular area of relative photopenia is identified at the posterolateral aspect of the inferior half of the left thyroid lobe (arrow).  While not palpable on physical examination, this photopenic area was felt to represent a cold nodule superimposed on diffusely increased iodine uptake throughout the rest of the gland in a patient with hyperthyroidism.  That is, this scan shows a solitary cold nodule in the presence of a scan which is otherwise consistent with Graves' disease.  This combination, when the nodule is subsequently found to be benign, has been termed Marine-Lenhart syndrome.  This patient&#8217;s workup is ongoing, with ultrasound and FNA biopsy of any identified nodule at the left lobe planned.
Likely Marine-Lenhart syndrome
Marine-Lenhart syndrome (if ultrasound shows a nodule and FNA reveals a benign etiology)
Multinodular goiter with a focal area of relative photopenia at the left lobe (very unlikely based on scintigraphic appearance)
The patient is a 24 year-old female referred to endocrinology by her primary physician because of abnormal thyroid function tests and tachycardia on physical exam.

The patient complains of palpitations, hand tremor, nervousness, difficulty sleeping, heat intolerance, a 5-8 pound unintentional weight loss, occasional shortness of breath at rest and with minimal exertion, and an increase in the frequency of her bowel movements.  The patient takes a beta-blocker.  She has no additional significant past medical history.  Her mother receives treatment for hypothyroidism.
