Multiple 1-2 mm punctate calcifications are scattered throughout the brain on the noncontrast scan (Films 1 and 2).  Focal areas of low attenuation are seen in the white matter with mild mass effect suggesting edema.  Following intravenous contrast multiple ring-enhancing lesions are present, some of which have a punctate calcification in the center of the ring (Films 3, 4, 5).  All areas of the brain are involved.  The ventricles are not enlarged.  There is a subgaleal fluid collection lateral to the right orbit (Films 3 and 6).  Tuberculous adenitis with enlarged nodes and neck calcifications are seen on cervical CT scans (Film 6).
Multiple tuberculomas (tuberculosis).  Subgaleal abscess.
8 year old with headaches.
Tuberculomas are small foci of tuberculous cerebritis surrounded by subacute or chronic inflammatory reaction.  When mature, tuberculomas contain caseous necrosis and may centrally calcify.  Tuberculomas are usually solitary lesions but occasionally may be multiple, as in this case.  The infection always results from hematogenous spread from a non-neural focus such as pulmonary, GI, GU, or osseous.  The lesions may occur anywhere in the central nervous system with symptoms resulting from the associated mass effect rather than from meningitis.  Tuberculomas enhance with contrast either in a solid homogeneous blush or as an unbroken ring of uniform thickness.

DIFFERENTIAL   DIAGNOSIS:  A  variety  of  organisms  can  produce  this   reaction; however,  TB is by far the most common.  Granulomas may occur with  Nocardia, Toxoplasma,  Histoplasma, Schistosoma, Paragonioma, and in the immunocompromised  host, Aspergillus and Phycomycetes.
