Ground glass, expansile appearance of left maxillary, bilateral ethmoid, left sphenoid, frontal and temporal bone.
Polyostotic Fibrous Dysplasia
Hyperphosphatasia
Chronic severe anemia
Paget's disease
Metastatic disease
Follow up. Patient with long history of facial deformity.
-Hyperphosphatasia can show thickening of the cranial bones and increased density, but with similar appearance to Paget's disease (see below). The most common involvement in the skull involves the jaw, which is prognathic.

-Chronic severe anemia (sickle cell disease, thallesemia) would show more generalized, rather than focal, skull thickening

-Paget's disease would be found in a much older age group(not a 13 year-old girl), and would show trabecular expansion, rather than ground glass appearance.

Metastatic disease (osteoblastic lesions) would be more focal than the above process, and more destructive in appearance.
