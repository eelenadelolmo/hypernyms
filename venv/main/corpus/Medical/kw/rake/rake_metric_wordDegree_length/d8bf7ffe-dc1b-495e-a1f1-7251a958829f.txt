CXR as above
Normal follow up PE and labs by ordering surgeon
No specific for this finding
Anomalous right inferior pulmonary vein drainage into inferior vena cava. No pulmonary nodules or masses seen, otherwise. No evident recurrence of breats CA seen on this CT.
Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return of right inferior pulmonary vein into inferior vena cava. No associated cardiac syndrome nor involvement of superior segments.
Scimitar syndrome
pulmonary sequestration
Patient had previous Dx of right sided breast CA for which she had been treated 3 years prior. On follow-up CXR, radiologist noted a questionable right pulmonary nodule, for which he/she suggested a chest CT to further evaluate this [asymptomatic] pt.
This finding can represent a nodule or mass on plainfilm, as was suspected by the initial CXR-reading radiologist. This is the lowest anomaly within the spectrum of anomalous pulmonary venous return, and is asymptomatic, as expected. If more superior pulmonary veins were also anomalous in their return, a "scimitar" venous structure might be seen on plain film, and more sx of cardiac shunting might be expected.
