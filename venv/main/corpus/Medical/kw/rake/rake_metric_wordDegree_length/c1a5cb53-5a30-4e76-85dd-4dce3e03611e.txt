Continue annual mammograms
Parenchymal redistribution with typical "swirling pattern" 90%
Elevation of nipple 85%
Ca++ around NAC 25%
Oil cysts/fat necrosis 20%
Retroareolar fibrotic bands 20%
Areolar/skin thickening 7%
Discontinuity of retroareolar ducts
Reduction Mammoplasty
Knowing the predictable changes after reduction mammoplasty can help reduce biopsies for findings mistaken for increased densities, masses, or calcifications.  However, women who have undergone reduction mammoplasty still have the same risk of developing breast cancer and may need to undergo biopsy if truly suspicious findings are present.
