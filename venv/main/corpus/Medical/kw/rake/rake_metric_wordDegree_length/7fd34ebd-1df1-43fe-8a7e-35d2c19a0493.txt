Patient was treated with RIPE therapy for the tuberculosis and drain placement for the abscesses
There is a moderate amount of peritoneal fluid.  Complete destruction of the L2 vertebral body and superior portion of the L3 vertebral body.  There is retropulsion of a bony fragment into the
spinal canal with severe spinal canal stenosis.

Bilateral multiloculated psoas fluid collections are seen with rim enhancement.

For the left psoas fluid collection, the largest pocket now measures 2.1 x 4.2 cm and is found at the level of L3-4.
 
The right psoas fluid collection is again seen, measuring 4 x 1.8 cm in
largest dimension, found at the L1-2 level.
