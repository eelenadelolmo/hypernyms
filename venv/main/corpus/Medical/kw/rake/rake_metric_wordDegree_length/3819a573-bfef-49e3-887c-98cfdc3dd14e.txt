No physical findings and no labs.
Simple curettage is often adequate treatment for enchondromas in the hands and feet. Enchondromas may recur and should be followed carefully after surgery. Recurrence of a lesion may indicate that the tumor either has undergone malignant change or possibly that the initial tumor, diagnosed as an enchondroma was a low-grade chondro-sarcoma.
Lateral radiographs of the right tibia shows a well-defined lytic mass with stippled calcifications without endosteal scalloping. Coronal STIR image of the proximal tibia shows a high-signal-intensity lobulated diaphyseal medullary mass with focal areas of low signal intensity corresponding the stippled calcifications on the plain radiographs These findings are consistent with a benign cartilaginous tumor, an enchondroma.  With the history of pain, close clinical and MRI follow-up is recommended.
Endochondroma
Enchondroma
Low-grade chondrosarcoma, although the radiographic findings suggest a more benign lesion
26 y/o AD USMC female currently being treated for stress fractures in bilateral lower extremities R > L.  A bone scan suggested a mild increased radiopharmaceutical uptake in the proximal tibial diaphysis, not suggestive of a stress fracture, besides the visualized stress fractures.
