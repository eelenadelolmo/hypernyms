RLQ tenderness, elevated ESR, WBC 12.7.
Contrast enhanced axial CT shows diffuse, circumferential, asymmetric bowel wall thickening in the terminal ileum and cecum.  Proliferate fatty inflammatory changes are present in the surrounding mesentery as are several prominent lymph nodes.  There is a focus of air within the inflammatory change that is possibly extraluminal; however there is no clear evidence of abscess.

Small bowel follow through shows mucosal irregularity within the terminal ileum and cecum.  The ileocecal junction is poorly defined.  There is luminal narrowing with tethering along the mesenteric border and saculation along the antimesenteric border of the bowel.  A cobblestone mucosal pattern is present along the terminal ileum.  There is isolation of the region from the remaining bowel (due to the proliferate fatty infiltration seen on CT).  There is a wisp of extraluminal contrast which upon comparison with the CT is likely a fistulous connection with pericecal inflammatory pockets.
