Photophobia with papilledema and nystagmus.  Mildly ataxic gate.  Laboratory values are non-contributory.
The mass was entirely resected via suboccipital craniotomy.  A ventriculostomy shunt was placed as well to relieve hydrocephalus.
MRI of the brain demonstrates a large, enhancing, cystic posterior fossa mass, centered within the fourth ventricle.  Associated hydrocephalus is also present.  The mass is dark on diffusion weighted images.
Cerebellar astrocytoma (pilocytic astrocytoma)
Pilocytic astrocytoma, ependymoma, medulloblastoma
8 year-old girl with headaches and nausea/vomiting.
This patient's pilocytic astrocytoma is atypical in appearance.  The classic pilocytic astrocytoma is centered within one of the cerebellar hemispheres and consists of a cyst and mural nodule.  This tumor appeared to be centered within the fourth ventricle.  While there were cystic components, the the mass was much more complex than the classic cyst and nodule.  After imaging, ependymoma and medulloblastoma were still on the differential, however since diffusion weighted images are dark, medulloblastoma was unlikely.
