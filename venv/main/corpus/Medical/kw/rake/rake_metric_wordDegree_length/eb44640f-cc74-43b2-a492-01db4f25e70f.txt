Chest:		No murmurs
		Small chest size
None; patients are often stillborn.  Disease is fatal within a few hours or days after birth, due to pulmonary hypoplasia from a hypoplastic thorax.

Thanatophoric Dysplasia (dwarfism), type I
Thanatophoric dwarf variants
Homozygous achondroplasia
Achondrogenesis I and II
Osteogenesis imperfecta type II
Asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia (dystrophy)
Patient is a 1 day old white male weighing 2.97 kilograms.  He was delivered at 38 weeks gestation.  Mom is a 34 y.o. G3P2002 and was referred to a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at 26 weeks due to prenatal ultrasound abnormalities diagnosed from outside facility.  Mom has had a cesarean delivery and a VBAC in the past.  Both children are alive and well.  There is no family history of skeletal dysplasia.
In this patient, findings characteristic for Type I thanatophoric dwarfism are demonstrated with upper and lower extremity micromelia.  Classically, the "telephone handset" ("telephone receiver" appearance of the femur is seen on plain films.  Other findings include macrocranium (increased OFC), frontal bossing, decreased thoracic circumference with bell shaped configuration and short ribs.  There is also flattening of the dysplastic acetabuli, relative abdominal girth protuberance and the appearance of excessive skin on short limbs.  Severe platyspondyly is noted best on the lateral projection.  The diagnosis was confirmed with genetic testing, R248C mutation on FGFR3 identified.  The patient survived for five days after birth, but then died due to respiratory complications.
