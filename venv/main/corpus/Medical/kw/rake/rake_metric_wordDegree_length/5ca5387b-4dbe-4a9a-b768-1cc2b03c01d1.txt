Texto: 
Reversal of cervical lordosis.
Decreased reflexes in upper extremities.
No myelopathic signs.
Conservative
CT following MVA in ER shows a subtle increased interspinous distance at C5-6 and minimally displaced inferior facet fracture on right at C6.

Plain film done on the present admission shows locked facets at C5-C6 with marked anterior subluxation.
C-spine fracture with locked facets
Hyperflexion injury with bilateral locked facets
47 year old man presents to neurosurgery clinic with a recent onset of neck pain and bilateral upper extremity paresthesias.  Nine months previously He was seen in the ER, following MVA  and then sent home.
The patient underwent a CT scan of entire spine, chest,  abdomen and pelvis in the ER following the MVA nine months ago.  All were interpreted as unremarkable.

45 pounds of traction failed to reduce the subluxation at C5-C6.
