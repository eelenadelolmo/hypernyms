Texto: 
Conservative treatments failed and a followup MRI showed increased osteonecrosis.  The patient subsequently underwent knee arthroplasty and did well, returning to work with no limitations.
MR images demonstrate a T1-dark, PD-bright lesion in the weightbearing articular portion of the medial femoral condyle, with mild thinning of the adjacent articular cartilage and a small focal depression in the adjacent cortical bone consistent with mild collapse. A small amount of PD-bright signal consistent with edema is present in the adjacent medial tibial plateau.
Spontaneous Osteonecrosis of the Knee
Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee
Osteochondritis dissecans
Osteonecrosis from other causes
58 yo Caucasian nurse with several weeks of knee pain, limiting her ability to ambulate in the clinic.

Due to her hospital connections, the patient went straight to MRI, with no plain radiographs available for correlation.
