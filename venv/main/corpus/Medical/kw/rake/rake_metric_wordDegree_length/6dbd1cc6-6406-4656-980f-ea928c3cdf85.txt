Texto: 
AP and lateral views of the axial skeleton, to include three views of the skull and AP views of the appendicular skeleton were obtained. 	
    	
There is a lucency in the skull which extends anteriorly from the left lambdoid suture, which is concerning for fracture given the overlying soft tissue swelling and the reason for the study.  An intraparietal suture could not be completely excluded as a normal variant, however.
Parietal Fracture
This is a 9-month-old baby boy with left-sided lateral head swelling for three days and parietal skull fracture without identified mechanism.
