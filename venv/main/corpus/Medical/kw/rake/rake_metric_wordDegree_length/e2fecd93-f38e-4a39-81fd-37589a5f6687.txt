Texto: 
The patient was afebrile, denied fever or chills.
No significant abnormal laboratory values were obtained.
Treatment options for this patient include percutaneous radiofrequency ablation, surgical excision or medical management in hopes of spontaneous regression. Each of the above have pertinent positive and negative aspects that will be briefly reviewed.

     Currently, a percutaneous ablation is the preferred method for treatment.  Percutaneous ablation can be CT-guided allowing for a method that is more precise, has a high success rate, less invasive, decreased tissue damage, and decreased complications. Percutaneous ablation of osteoid osteomas is limited when the lesion is juxtaposed to a neurovascular bundle or located in the spine close to the spinal cord. Surgery may be the preferred method in spinal lesions. 

Concerns with percutaneous ablation is a limited ability to confirm the histology of the lesion. Ablation is typically via heat and this has a limited range of 10mm spherically. Therefore, ovoid or irregular lesion are more difficult to treat (4).

Surgical treatment is well-established with either an en-bloc or curettage modality.  It has a high success rates, confirmation of histopathology is possible. As stated above, surgery for spinal lesions may be preferred. Concerns with surgical excision is wide exposure techniques, more invasive leading to greater tissue damage, and delayed recovery (4).

Medical management is based on the inherent nature of osteiod osteoma to spontaneously regress. Untoward effects of medical management is both the possibility of continuing intense pain and the adverse effects of medication (4).
After unremarkable radiographs were performed, subsequent CT and MRI of the femur was performed.

A small focal radiolucent lesion found in the distal one third of the femur, centered in the cortex.  Subtle reactive sclerosis can be seen on the periphery of the lesion. The radiolucency is no greater than 1cm at its longest axis.  Subtle central calcification is present.
Mild surrounding edema.  No medullary extension.

This 25 yo man who presents with worsening left thigh pain. Pain awakens patient at night and is no longer relieved by naproxen.
Based on the patient presentation, Osteoid osteoma was high on the differential and likely. The patient was a 25 year old male. Patient are almost exclusively under 30 years old and male to female ratio is 2-3:1. He had typical night time pain symptoms and had some relief from Naproxen.

Appearance on imaging is also typical for this entity.  Imaging showed an area of lucency located in the femur. The lower extremity is a common location for osteoid osteoma.  The most common location is in the femoral neck (3,4). 

Partial relief from Naproxen is expected. While salicylates classically are described to ameliorate pain symptoms, this was not found in this patient. COX1 & 2 over expression has been found in the nidus of osteoid osteomas (3,4).
