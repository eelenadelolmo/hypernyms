Blood pressure measured 162/96.  Remaining vital signs were normal.  Labs to include CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, TSH, aldosterone, VMA and metanephrines were within normal limits.
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.  In patient's who undergo PTA, periodic blood pressure measurements should be followed.
String of beads appearance with alternating segments of stricture and dilation of the mid to distal right renal artery.  The patient was found to have two left renal arteries, with the more inferior artery demonstrating the string of beads appearance.
Fibromuscular Dysplasia
1.  Fibromuscular Dysplasia.
2.  Atherosclerotic renal artery disease, however this is most likely to be seen at the origin of the renal artery in an older patient with cardiovascular risk factors.
3.  Polyarteritis Nodosa, however the aneurysms tend to be smaller and more peripheral.
4.  Other vasculitides.
47 year old female with hypertension, uncontrolled with multiple antihypertensive medications.  Patient is a nonsmoker and generally feels well.
This patient underwent PTA and had a significant decrease in blood pressure, allowing good control with a single antihypertensive medication.
