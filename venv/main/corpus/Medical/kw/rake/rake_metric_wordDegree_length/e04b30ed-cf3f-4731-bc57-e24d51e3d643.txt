59 y.o. woman with left shoulder pain and new onset of cough
She originally came to medical attention with a complaint of left shoulder pain.  A plain radiograph demonstrated cortical destruction of left glenoid.

MRI was scheduled, but patient presented with cough prior to study.

CXR demonstrated pulmonary nodules.  Led to follow-up CT which demonstrated spiculated pulmonary nodules, mediastinal invasion with necrotic lympadenopathy, and left scapular osseous metastasis.
