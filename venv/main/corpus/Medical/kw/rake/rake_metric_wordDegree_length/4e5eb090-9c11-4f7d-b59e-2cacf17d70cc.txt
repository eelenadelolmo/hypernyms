Postseptal cellulitis, also known as orbital cellulitis, usually follows sinusitis in up to 75% of cases or maybe secondary to trauma.  In contradistinction to preseptal cellulitis, orbital cellulitis is a more severe disease generally seen in older children or adults.  According to its location, orbital cellulitis maybe classified as subperiosteal, bulbar, or retrobulbar.
