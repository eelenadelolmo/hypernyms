• Myositis of L Lateral Pterygoid 


A 1.23 cm x 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm filling  defect seen involving the L IJV at the level of C5, likely septic thrombophlebitis according to history.  Distal to the clot a 2.42cm narrowing  vessel, possible spasm or elongation of clot. Mild right paratracheal adenopathy.  
Biapical & RUL nodular densities with ill-defined margins  suggestive of septic emboli. Cannot exclude additional nodules in the atelectatic portions of the lungs. 
Large right pleural fluid collection w/ associated atelectasis of right  lower/middle lobes & partial atelectasis right upper lobe.
