Non Contributory, known SLE from prior physical and lab analysis.
Treatment is supportive and with management of the underlying condition.  In this case it is difficult because the treatment for SLE (steroids) is also a cause of osteonecrosis.  As far as the wrist AVN goes, surgery to try and unload the lunate may be beneficial, but as the condition progresses, lunate resection may be needed.
Findings:
	Knee: There is a large joint effusion.  Within the distal femur and proximal tibia there are serpiginous, geographic areas of heterogeneous but primarily decreased signal intensity on T1 weighted images and increased signal intensity on T2 weighted images, consistent with osteonecrosis. Small subchondral areas of osteonecrosis involve both the medial and lateral femoral condyles.  A large area of osteonecrosis is seen on the posterior-lateral femoral condyle which has fluid extending deep to an osteochondral flap or unstable fragment measuring 3 cm in length on the sagittal plane.  There is diffuse edema or reactive marrow changes in the medial femoral condyle.  There is diffuse soft tissue edema in the medial and posterior soft tissues of the knee.

	Wrist: The lunate shows diffuse decreased signal intensity on the Gradient Echo and T1 weighted image sequences in comparison to the remaining carpal bones.  There is undersurface irregularity and flattening of the proximal lunate consistent with collapse.  Additionally, there is cartilage loss in the entire proximal row of carpal bones, but most extensively in the lunate.  Mild degenerative change is seen in the proximal aspect of the scaphoid.  There is T2 bright signal seen in the distal radioulnar joint, scapholunate joint and the triquetral-pisiform recess consistent with diffuse wrist synovitis.  Incidentally, there is abnormal T2 signal seen in the TFCC both centrally and in its proximal attachment to the ulna.  There is a positive ulnar variance.  These findings are consistent with a tear of the TFCC.
Multifocal Bone Infarcts (Osteonecrosis) in a patient with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.
-Trauma (fracture or dislocation), -Hemoglobinopathies (sickle cell anemia, sickle cell variants), 
-Exogenous or endogenous hypercortisolism (corticosteroid medication therapy or Cushing’s disease), 
-Small vessel disease (collagen vascular disorders: e.g. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus), 
-Irradiation
-Chemotherapy
-Synovitis with elevation of intra-articular pressures (infection, hemophilia) 
-Idiopathic or spontaneous.
31-year-old female with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and being treated with chronic corticosteroid therapy.  Has left knee and left wrist pain.  No history of trauma
