Single axial CT image demonstrates a large right adnexal mass.  Ultrasound images show a large right adnexal mass with internal blood flow.
Uterine leiomyoma (fibroid)
Solid adnexal tumor:
Granulosa cell tumor
Thecoma
Fibroma
Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor

Broad ligament fibroid
Denies history of pelvic pain or post-menopausal bleeding.
Since no discrete right ovary was identified and mass had internal blood flow, there was concern for a solid adnexal tumor.
