Texto: 
Pain along the medial tibia with tenderness to palpation.  Antalgic gait.
Patient was given exercise limitations and a walking boot.
Initial plain radiographs demonstrate linear, nonaggressive periosteal reaction along the tibial diaphysis.

Tc 99m MDP bone scan demonstrates a tubular focus of increased uptake along the distal tibial diaphysis on pool and delayed imaging.

CT demonstrates a vertically oriented fracture along the medial tibial diaphysis with eccentric periosteal reaction and endosteal callus.
Vertical stress fracture
Based upon scintigraphic findings:
Tumor
Fracture
Infection
38 year old African American male with history of pain with ambulation for 3 weeks.  

PMHx:  No chronic medical disease, history of malignancy or sickle cell disease.
Given the clinical history of a recent increase in activity and pain along the tibial diaphysis, the likelihood of a stress fracture was high.  The initial plain radiographs demonstrated periosteal reaction. Scintigraphic findings of a tubular focus of activity suggested a longitudinal stress fracture; however, given the pattern of uptake, the possibility of neoplasm was entertained.  Subsequent CT of the tibia, confirmed the diagnosis of a longitudinal stress fracture.
