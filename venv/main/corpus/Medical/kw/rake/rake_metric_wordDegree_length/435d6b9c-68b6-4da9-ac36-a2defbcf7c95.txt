This patient underwent subsequent surgical pin stabalization of the femoral head.
AP view of the pelvis without prior studies for comparison in this skeletally immature individual, demonstrates approximately 2.8 cm superior subluxation of the right femoral neck on the femoral head and approximately 1.3 cm of superior subluxation of the left femoral neck on the left femoral head.  There is a small amount of sclerosis at the bilateral femoral epiphysis.  There is also an area of increased sclerosis at the right femoral neck, slightly more distal than the epiphysis. There is a small, lucent lesion at the medial distal femoral diaphysis. This lesion demonstrates a short zone of transition with no periosteal or soft tissue reaction. The remainder of the bones and soft tissues are unremarkable.
Slipped capital femoral epiphysis
1. Bilateral slipped capital femoral epiphysis. There is mild sclerosis adjacent to the bilateral epiphysis and this is likely chronic.                            
2. Increased sclerosis of the right femoral neck just distal to the femoral epiphysis may be stress reaction vs. superimposition of shadows.               
3. Likely fibrous cortical defect of the distal femoral diaphysis.
A 14 year old male presents with right hip pain and walking with a limp for the past 3 months.  The patient has constant internal rotation of the hip while sitting and laying supine, and hip flexion is severely limited.
Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is displacement of the femoral epiphysis relative to the femoral neck through the growth plate in a child.  The etiology is unknown but may be due to an endocrine process or a biomechanical problem.  It tends to occur most often in overweight young teenagers, and boys are affected more frequently than girls.  90% of patients present with a history of pain, and 50% present with a history of tauma.
AP and lateral views of the hip are typically used to make the diagnosis of SCFE.  15-25% of cases are bilateral.  Malalignment of the epiphysis femoral neck line will typically be evident, and although subtle changes can be difficult to detect.  The growth plate will appear widened, and the epiphysis may appear decreased in height due to posterior slippage.  Complications include osteonecrosis, chonfrolysis (cartilage necrosis) from fixation pins, varus deformity, and degenerative osteoarthritis.
