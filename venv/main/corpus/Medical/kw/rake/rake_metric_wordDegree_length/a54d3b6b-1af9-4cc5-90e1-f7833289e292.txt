Afebrile
Heart rate 96
BP 131/90
SpO2 98%
Physical exam significant for rales bilaterally in the lungs.
While in the hospital, the patient was treated with a gentle diuresis.  Medications including an ACE-inhibitor and beta blocker were initiated during hospitalization and were to be continued at discharge.  Obstretrics and gynecology advised long-term contraception and counseled patient as to the need of avoiding future pregnancy which could be life-threatening.  The patient was to follow-up with her primary care physician and pulmonologist in 4 weeks.
Chest radiograph demonstrates cardiac enlargement and vascular prominence and opacity of the right lower lung.  
CT demonstrates cardiac enlargement with dilated left ventricle and small bilateral pleural effusions as well as patchy areas of airspace consolidation bilaterally, compatible with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. 
TTE shows severe apical and periapical hypokinesia with an EF of only 10-15%.
Peripartum cardiomyopathy
•Peripartum cardiomyopathy, with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage due to acute onset severe LV dysfunction
•Cardiomyopathy of other cause, with patchy consolidation due to pneumonia or hemorrhage associated with immune disorder
22 year old G1P1 presents with hemoptysis and shortness of breath for 1 day.  She is 8 days post induced labor and delivery at 36 weeks due to pre-eclampsia and was discharged 2 days ago on beta blocker and clonidine patch.
This patient demonstrated new onset of cardiac enlargement with left ventricular dilatation and severely reduced ejection fraction to 10-15% approximately 1 week after labor and delivery.  Given no other predisposing factors for cardiomyopathy and timing of onset, the patient was diagnosed with peripartum cardiomyopathy.  This patient suffered from pre-eclampia during and after her pregnancy, which is has been reported as a risk factor for peripartum cardiomyopathy.  Imaging demonstrated evidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage which was determined to be due to rapid onset of pulmonary venous hypertension associated with the acute development of severe left ventricular dysfunction as immune workup and bronchoscopy were negative for another cause.
