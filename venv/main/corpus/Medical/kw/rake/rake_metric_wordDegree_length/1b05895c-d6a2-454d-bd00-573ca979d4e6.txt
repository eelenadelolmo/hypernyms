Severe pain lower mid back.  No neurologic findings
Unknown
The anteroposterior radiograph reveals bulking of the lateral cortices of the vertebral body close to the involved end plate, together with a decrease in the height of the body.  In lateral-flexion injuries, compression forces may result in a wedge-shaped deformity of the vertebral body.  In subtle cases, a clue to the diagnosis may be seen in a localized bulge of the paraspinal line secondary to hemorrhage and edema.  However, it should be kept in mind that this finding may also be seen in pathologic fractures secondary to skeletal mets to the spine.  On the lateral view, a simple vertebral compression fracture can be seen by a decrease in the height of the anterior part of the body, while the height of the posterior part and posterior cortex is maintained.
Lumbar compression fracture
Traumatic fracture, acute or chronic
Pathologic fracture
34 year old male involved in an MVA where he reports “slamming into ceiling during the crash.”
This case nicely demonstrates the findings of compression fracture in an otherwise healthy man.  Given the history, the diagnosis could be made from the plain film, but neurosurgery requested the MR to rule out any compression on the thecal sac/cord. Some would prefer CT over MRI to visualize canal and foraminal encroachment with greater visualization of bony detail.
