Texto: 
The patient will deliver in a tertiary care center with neonatology present for the delivery. Non-emergent surgical resection is planned assuming the patient has no significant respiratory distress as a result of the CCAM.
Ultrasound images of the gravid uterus (32 weeks gestational age) demonstrate a large cystic mass within the right hemithorax without significant Doppler flow and minimal leftward mediastinal shift.

Fetal MR images (single shot fast spin echo T2 sequences) in multiple planes demonstrate a mass replacing the right lower lobe with multiple distinct cystic lesions of varying sizes within.  The lesion has some mass effect on both the right middle and upper lobes.  There is minimal leftward mediastinal shift. No feeding vessels were identified.  No other fetal abnormalities were present.
Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation of the Lung
• Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (type 1)
• Pulmonary sequestration
• Bronchogenic cyst
26 year-old female pregnant with with a 32 week fetus for routine fetal ultrasound.
This patient was initially diagnosed on routine fetal ultrasound at an outside facility.  She was referred to a tertiary care center for repeat fetal ultrasound and fetal MR imaging to better evaluate the mass and obtain appropriate risk stratification for delivery and neonatal needs.
