Texto: 
Bilateral longitudinal surgical scars at the medial dorsal midfoot. Inability to initiate or maintain assisted extension of the left great toes.  Non-tender.  Non-palpable extensor hallicus longus (EHL)tendon.  Otherwise, the toe was completely neurovascularly intact.
Observation v Tenorrhaphy (debatable, may depend on location)
-  Loss of internal fibrillar architecture
-  Fluid within the tendonous space
-  Nonvisualization of portions of the tendon
-  Thickening of the proximal EHL tendon
Tear of the Extensor Hallucis Longus Tendon
EHL tendon tear/laceration
Recent bilateral bunionectomies.  Now the patient cannot extend the left great toe.
The three tendons within the extensor compartment of the leg include the tibialis anterior (TA), extensor hallucis longus (EHL), and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) in a medial to lateral orientation.  The tibialis anterior should be the largest sonographically at the level of the ankle (see images of the patient’s right ankle for the normal configuration).  On the patient’s left there is clear enlargement of the EHL tendon such that it exceeds the size of the TA.

The EHL originates from the medial fibula and interosseous membrane and inserts at the proximal metaphysis of the first distal phalanx.  The muscle functions as the primary extensor of the great toe. Traumatic tear of the EHL tendon is a rare injury, and it is very uncommon, especially without involvement of the tibialis anterior.  In this case, transection at surgery is the apparent etiology.  With removal of bony tissue at bunionectomy, if the tendon had not shown evidence of tear, one might suspect laxity within the tendon as a cause of the patients inability to extend his toe.  However, sonographic evidence of tear including nonvisualization of portions of the tendon, loss of internal fibrillar architecture, proximal tendionous thickening, and anechoic fluid within the tendon were convincing.  Other sonographic findings to suggest tear are visualization of a blunt tendinous tip on longitudinal imaging and refractive shadowing due to thickening.

Surgical repair is controversial and may depend on location. Tenorrhaphy or transfer of the EDL tendon are possible surgical treatments.
