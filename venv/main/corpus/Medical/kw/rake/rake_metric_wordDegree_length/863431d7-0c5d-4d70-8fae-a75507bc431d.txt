Patient is pending angiography for definitive diagnosis.
The planar image demonstrates decreased size of the left kidney with decreased radiotracer uptake; and an irregular contour of the right kidney with increased uptake inferiorly 
which correlate with MRI findings of hypertrophy of the lower pole of the right kidney.  Differential function is 17.7% on the left and 82.3% on the right.
Renovascular Hypertension
Fibromuscular dysplasia
Arteriovenous malformation
Vasculitis
6 year old female with hypertension.  On ultrasound the left kidney demonstrated parvus tardus waveform suggestive of renal artery stenosis.  MRI/MRA of the kidneys demonstrated bilateral renal scarring with severe stenosis of the left renal artery and hypertrophy of the lower pole of the right kidney.  The two right renal arteries were normal.
Fibromuscular dysplasia (Fibrous Renal Artery Disease) is the most frequent cause of renovascular hypertension in children, which makes up 40 to 80 percent of cases.  Four types of fibrous renal artery disease exist: medial fibroplasia, perimedial fibroplasia, medial hyperplasia and intimal fibroplasia.  Medial fibroplasias (75% of lesions) affect the distal half of the main renal artery extending frequently into major branches and is often bilateral.  Angiography demonstrates multiple aneurysms (&#8220;string of beads&#8221; sign).  

This patient is pending angiography for definitive diagnosis.
