Electrodiagnostic Report
TYPE: Upper extremity NCS/Needle EMG
ELECTRODIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS:
1. Normal distal motor latencies and amplitudes of the right and left Median & Ulnar nerves.
2. Normal F-responses of the right and left Median & Ulnar nerves.
3. Normal distal sensory latencies and amplitudes of the right and left Median, Ulnar and Superficial Radial nerves.
4. Normal right and left Median H-reflexes.
5. Normal needle EMG examination of the right and left upper limb and cervical paraspinal muscles. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of normal distal motor and sensory latencies of the right and left median and ulnar nerves strongly negates the probability of a peripheral entrapment (neuropathy) of these nerves. There were normal right and left superficial radial sensory studies observed as well. Late responses including median H reflexes and F waves were present and symmetrical bilaterally without prolongation. There was a normal monopolar needle EMG examination. There were no spontaneous potentials or chronic neuropathic motor units encountered in any of the sampled upper limb & cervical paraspinal muscles upon monopolar needle EMG thus, cervical radiculopathy could not be verified at this time. However, I cannot rule out cervical radiculopathy.
IMPRESSION:
This individual exhibits electrophysiological findings consistent with the following:
1. No electrophysiological evidence of a cervical radiculopathy, focal upper extremity entrapment neuropathy, brachial plexopathy, upper extremity peripheral polyneuropathy, or myopathy was observed.
2. Cervical spine musculoligamentous and/or discogenic origin of pain are likely contributing as pain generators in this case. A surgical spine consultation is suggested if his symptoms remain refractory to conservative care or if further neurological deficits develop.

The treatment modality for this particular patient involved chiropractic care, physical therapy, non-opioid pain control (NSAIDs, acupuncture, massage therapy, etc.), and tracking his progression using The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Static Strength Testing Assessment. Physical exercise now performed at the chiropractic office includes back and core strengthening. The patient reports that meloxicam, an NSAID, has worked very well in controlling his pain and he can continue to use the medication as needed. Lastly, the patient will continue to follow-up with the chiropractic office in order to assess his progression using the patientâ€™s scores on the NIOSH Static Strength Testing Assessment.

MVA induced disc herniation at C5/6 with clinical radiculopathy, vertebral motion dysfunction superimposed on pre-existing CIS
1.) C5-C6 right paramedian herniation with clinical upper extremity radiculopathy
2.) C4-C5, C6-C7, and L5-S1 discopathy with clinical radiculopathy
3.) MVA induced alteration of motion segment integrity (AOMSI) in C2-C3, L3-L4, and L5-S1 secondary to ligamentous sub-failure
4.) Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)
The patient is a 48 year old Caucasian male with history of clinically isolated syndrome (a disease course of multiple sclerosis) who presented to the chiropractic office for cervical and lumbar spine injuries secondary to a motor vehicle accident (MVA). The patient was the seat-belted driver of a car traveling approximately 45 miles per hour when an oncoming pickup truck reportedly made a left-hand turn in front of him and struck his vehicle. The patient then struck another SUV that was stopped at a red light. The patientâ€™s vehicleâ€™s airbags deployed and his head slammed against the driverâ€™s side window which caused a bump on his head, which has since resolved. The patient reports loss of consciousness from when he crashed until he was in the ambulance. At the hospital, a head CT scan was performed and the patient was diagnosed with a concussion. The decision was made not to admit the patient and he was released from the hospital.

Approximately 10 months since the accident, the patient complains of neck pain (3/10 in severity) which radiates down the lateral aspect of his right arm to his elbow. He also has lower back pain (3/10 in severity) which radiates down both legs. His lower back pain gets worse after exercise, standing, or walking for more than 30 minutes to an hour before resting. The patient reports that meloxicam helps control his pain.

The patient reports having difficulty getting dressed and has been unable to perform various activities that he used to enjoy. He is unable to play golf or tennis anymore. He is unable to stand for long periods of time which makes his job as a sales manager more difficult because he is required to be on his feet for long periods of time. The patient stated he had been able to carry wine boxes, which weigh between 30-40 pounds each, up a flight of stairs at his wifeâ€™s liquor store prior to the accident. After the accident, the patient reports he is unable to bend down low enough to pick up the wine boxes and he no longer has the strength to lift the wine boxes. Lastly, the patient reports that his right lower extremity has been weaker since 2008 and that he has to compensate for his foot drop while walking.

The patient had an existing diagnosis of Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) prior to the motor vehicle accident which has the potential to complicate his clinical picture given CIS can cause muscular strength and neurological deficits. 

The patientâ€™s history and physical exam findings suggest that his antalgic gait and sub-patellar hyper-reflexivity are likely secondary to his CIS diagnosis. The patient stated he first experienced foot drop approximately 9 years before his motor vehicle accident. Also, the patient has not received any FDA approved treatments for CIS such as interferon beta-1a (AvonexÂ®, BetaseronÂ®, and ExtaviaÂ®) or glatiramer acetate (CopaxoneÂ® and GlatopaTM).[1]

A T2 weighted MRI of the patient's cervical spine revealed at the C4-C5 vertebral level a disc bulge  (see Figure 5 C4-C5 Cervical Spine T2 MRI), at the C5-C6 level a right paramedian herniation of nucleus pulposus protruding into the thecal sac (see Figure 6 C5-C6 Cervical Spine T2 MRI), at the C6-C7 level a mild bulge of the annulus with a subligamentous annular tear (see Figure 7 C6-C7 Cervical Spine T2 MRI).

In addition to imaging, the stability of the patientâ€™s cervical spine was assessed using endplate analysis and Penningâ€™s Analysis in a radiographic instability report. Endplate analysis involves constructing tangential lines from inferior vertebrae, in this case C2-C7, to objectively analyze vertebral segmental alignment in the neutral, flexion, and extension positions.[4] At first glance the patientâ€™s endplate analysis results appear to be normal. However, the patientâ€™s cervical spine was determined to have a functional deficit using Penningâ€™s Analysis because the patientâ€™s C2-C3 angular excursion was measured to be 13.8Â° which is well above the normal value of 12.0Â°. This finding indicates, the patient has ligamentous instability and loss of motion segment integrity exists at the C2-C3 level when he was assessed for total movement from the flexion to extension position. Penningâ€™s Analysis for cervical spine stability has been shown to be one of the most valid methods for assessing total range of motion from flexion to extension. The extension film is superimposed on the flexion film, with the C7 vertebrae exactly matching. A line is drawn along one of the edges of the extension film onto the flexion film. Next C6 is superimposed and a second line is drawn. The angle between the two lines is the degree of flexion/extension movement between C6 and C7. In the same way, the range of motion between the other vertebrae is determined. The established average values of segmental motion have been determined for comparison by Penning's.[4]

In order to determine the underlying cause of the radiculopathy, the patient underwent an upper extremity electrodiagnostic evaluation to further investigate if either of these conditions were contributing to his radiating right arm pain. The electromyography (EMG) found that there was no electrophysiological evidence of cervical radiculopathy, focal upper extremity entrapment neuropathy, brachial plexopathy, upper extremity peripheral polyneuropathy, or myopathy. The overall sensitivity of needle EMG in the diagnosis of radiculopathy is in the range of 50% and 71%. Based on these sensitivities, it is important to recognize that a negative EMG study does not rule out the presence of radiculopathy.[13] Cervical spine functional deficits may or may not cause radiculopathy depending on how the patientâ€™s head and neck were positioned during the EMG. It should also be noted that CIS more commonly affects the lower extremities than the upper extremities. The most likely cause of the patientâ€™s radiating arm pain is the C5-C6 right sided disc herniation.  

The patientâ€™s lumbar stability was also assessed using endplate analysis in the same radiographic instability report. Only endplate analysis was needed because two segments, L3-L4 and L5-S1, well exceeded normal values in both flexion and extension. L3-L4 flexion was measured to be 16.6Â° and extension was 16.0Â°. Normal L3-L4 flexion and extension should not exceed 15Â°. L5-S1 flexion was measured to be 29.9Â° and extension was 39.7Â°. Normal L5-S1 flexion and extension should not exceed 25Â°. The patientâ€™s lumbar spine instability and the mild L5-S1 nucleus pulposus protrusion seen on T2 MRI (see Figure 12 L5-S1 Lumbar Spine T2 MRI) were likely major contributing factors causing the patientâ€™s lower back pain and lower extremity weakness. Also, the lumbar spine instability may have contributed to the patientâ€™s worsening antalgic gait as well.

The treatment modality for this particular patient involved chiropractic care, physical therapy, non-opioid pain control chiropractic care and NSAIDs.   Physical exercise now performed at the chiropractic office includes back and core strengthening.   Physical exercise is important so he can increase his neck and lower back muscle strength in order to compensate for the ligamentous sprain at  C2-C3, C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7, L3-L4, and L5-S1 vertebral segments in his C4-C5, C5-C6, and L5-S1 vertebral segments. The patient reports that meloxicam, an NSAID, has worked very well in controlling his pain and he can continue to use the medication as needed. Lastly, the patient will continue to follow-up with the chiropractic office in order to assess his progression using the patientâ€™s scores on the NIOSH Static Strength Testing Assessment.

In conclusion, this patient was diagnosed with MVA induced disc herniation at C5/C6 with clinical radiculopathy, MVA induced vertebral functional segmental deficit with superimposed pre-existing CIS. The patientâ€™s lumbar spine functional deficits and the mild L5-S1 nucleus pulposus protrusion seen on T2 MRI were likely major contributing factors causing the patientâ€™s lower back pain and lower extremity weakness. Also, the lumbar spine functional deficits may have contributed to the patientâ€™s worsening antalgic gait as well.
