AP view of the wrist demonstrates widening of the scapholunate joint (scapholunate ligament tear), dissociation of the lunate and trapezium (lunotriquetral ligament tear), foreshortening of the scaphoid due to rotary subluxation, and proximal migration of the capitate.  The radioscaphoid joint space is decreased with associated sclerosis.  Lateral view of the wrist demonstrates increased scapholunate angle, dorsal tilt of the lunate, and proximal migration of the capitate.
