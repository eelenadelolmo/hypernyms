Pulse 105, BP 90/60 R 20. T 99.0 Pertinent findings include 3+ bilateral papillary edema, EOMI, PERRLA with complaints of brightness of light. VA 20/50 O.D., 20/60 O.S., CN II-XII grossly intact, neck supple, heart, lungs and abdominal exam normal, motor and sensory exam normal, cerebellar exam remarkable for wide-based gait, inability to tandem walk, and decreased finger to nose, heel to shin and rapid alternating movements with dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesis.

Lab studies: CBC normal, chemistries normal, urinanalysis normal
Contrast and Non-contrast study of the head:  Turning attention to the non-contrast study first, the most striking finding is the extent of hydrocephalus, with dilatation of both lateral ventricles and third ventricle. Looking at images three and four, there is an obvious hyperdense mass in the posterior fossa in the midline, obliterating the fourth ventricle. There seems to be hypodense regions in the center of the mass, suggesting central necrosis or cyst. Compression of the brainstem anteriorly is also evident There is no evidence of calcification, and both internal auditory canals are normal, and there are no cortex lesions. The contrast exam shows enhancement of the mass in a uniform manner. Vascularity is otherwise normal.
Medulloblastoma
Cerebellar astrocytoma, Medulloblastoma, Ependymoma,
Hemangioblastoma, Dermoid tumor, Choroid plexus papilloma, Colloid cyst, Meningioma, and secondary metastases are neoplasms which occur in the posterior fossa
8yo African American female who presents with morning vomiting, wide-based gait, headache, and blurred vision

Her complaints began four to six weeks ago, and her pediatrician attributed her symptoms to a "viral syndrome", prescribing rest, fluids and Tylenol. Her vomiting is projective in nature, without associated nausea. It started only occasionally, but progressed to daily over the course of 3-4 weeks. Her headache is described as pancephalic, worse in the morning as well and not relieved by aspirin. She describes the blackboard at school as being "fuzzy". Her pre-natal course and delivery were unremarkable, and she has been in the 85th percentile on her growth curve. Developmental milestones wore reached at appropriate ages. She has done very well in school with an 89 average, but notes she does less well in gym class lately. There is a positive family history for cancer in her paternal grandmother and aunt, location and type unknown. Review of systems also reveals photophobia of three weeks duration. No meds, NKDA.
1) Medolloblastoma- occurs 2:1 males versus females, most common in the first and second decades of life, arise in the region or the medullary velum, therefore midline and often obliterate the fourth ventricle. The large majority of lesions are rounded or lobulated, denser than surrounding brain and generally homogenous with occasional cystic regions or central necrosis. Also a probable choice in this case due to the presence of the above characteristics.

2) Ependymoma- a relatively uncommon tumor arising within the fourth ventricle, which is therefore obliterated, resembles a medulloblastoma in that it is hyperdense and homogenous. Calcification suggests ependymoma and hydrocephalus is usually marked. Possible here as all of the findings of ependymoma are present except for calcification.

3) Cerebellar astrocytomas- most common type of primary intracranial al tumor found in the posterior fossa, usually show low attenuation lying in one cerebellar hemisphere, but midline position is not uncommon. Not likely here due to the high attenuation relative to surrounding brain.

4) Meningioma- occur in the cerebello-pontine angle and may be confused wish acoustic neuromas, grow over the cerebellar convexity, particularly at its lateral angle.  They enhance markedly.  Also unlikely here due to the midline position of to lesion, the obstructive hydrocephalus, and the anterior shift of the brain stem with fourth ventricle obliteration.

5) Hemangioblastoma - may be solitary or multiple. less commonly as part of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome with eye, brain and cord involvement, usually in the cerebellar hemispheres, hypodense on non-contrast study with marked enhancement with contrast. Unlikely here as well since the lesion was hyperdense before enhancement.

6) Dermoid tumor - heterogeneous tumor with mixed soft tissue and bone density, uncommon in the posterior fossa- unlikely due to relative homogeneity of the lesion.

7) Colloid cyst - existence of which is debated in the fourth ventricle, (usually present in the third ventricle at  the posterior margin of the foramen of Monroe), present as hypodense lesions, not likely with this hyperdense lesion, far too big.

8) Metastases- form the most common type of cerebellar tumor seen in adults, usually in the hemispheres, with mild hydrocephalus Unlikely here due to the patient's age, prior excellent health, location of the tumor and the severe hydrocephalus.

9) Choroid plexus papilloma- exceedingly rare, and the choroid is normal on contrast study.
