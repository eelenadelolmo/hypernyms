Texto: 
Left lateral hepatic lobe mass shows peripheral nodular enhancement on arterial phase imaging.  On delayed imaging, continual filling in of this mass with contrast is seen.
Cavernous hemangioma
DDX for enhancing focal liver lesions:
Cavernous Hemangioma
Focal Nodular Hyperplasia
Adenoma
Hepatocellular carcinoma
Metastases
30 year old male presents with hematuria.
Diagnosis of hepatic hemangioma can be made on the basis of a characteristic peripheral nodular enhancement with gradual fill-in, mirroring the density of the blood pool. Focal Nodular Hyperplasia is the second most common benign hepatic neoplasm.  FNH is a hypervascular, well-marginated tumor that often contains a characteristic stellate central scar.  Most often, FNH shows intense early arterial phase enhancement, but is often imperceptible during later phases as the tumor parenchymal attenuation matches normal enhancing hepatic parenchyma. 

Adenomas are also hypervascular lesions that can have a variable appearance on CT due to its propensity to hemorrhage.  Typically, areas of infarction and hemorrhage are present and may make them difficult to distinguish from hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatic adenomas also tend to enhance early during arterial phase in a heterogenous fashion.

While both are variable in their phase of enhancement and washout characteristics, neither hepatocellular carcinoma nor metastases will demonstrate the specific enhancement pattern described above and demonstrated in this case and should not be realistically considered.
