Right-sided facial weakness.
No treatment is required for a benign pineal cyst, unless it grows in size causing mass effect.
Axial T1 and T2 images demonstrate a 5 x 6 x 4 mm cystic structure at the normal location of the pineal gland which is hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2. Axial and Coronal T1W images after the addition of gadolinium shows that the lesion does not significantly enhance.
Pineal Cyst
Differential diagnosis includes:
-Pineal cyst
-Pinoblastoma
-pinocytoma
-Teratoma
-Germ cell tumor
-Astrocytoma
10 year old girl with history of left temporal and parietal slowing of the EEG.
Lack of enhancement with gadolinium combined with hypointense T1 and hyperintense T2 signals are consistent with a benign pineal cyst; which, in this case, did not contribute to the patient's complaints.
