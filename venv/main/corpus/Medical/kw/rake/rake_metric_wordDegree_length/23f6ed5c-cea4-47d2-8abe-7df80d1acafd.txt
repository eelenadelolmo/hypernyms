Film #1: Nonenhanced axial CT image of the head shows a bilobed circumscribed hyperdense lesion centered on the left optic nerve that extends to the orbital apex. No evidence of extension is seen outside the bony orbit. 

Film #2 and 3: Axial T1 and T2 weighted images, respectively, shows a bilobed T1 hypointense and T2 heterogenously hyperintense mass arising from the left optic nerve sheath with mildly associated proptosis. There is a clear demarcation present between the mass and optic nerve.   

Film #4: Axial T1 postgadolinium with fat saturation shows the mass to enhance intensely and is only slightly inhomogeneous.
Optic nerve sheath meningioma.
1. Optic nerve sheath meningioma.
2. Neurofibroma.
3. Cavernous hemangioma.
4. Intraconal hematoma.
70 year old female for follow up follow up tumor.
