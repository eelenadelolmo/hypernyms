24 hr radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) was 0.4% (normal 8-30%).  Scintigraphy utilizing Tc99m pertechnetate demonstrated almost no trapping of the radiopharmaceutical in the thyroid bed.  There was homogeneously decreased activity.
subacute thyroiditis
Differential Diagnosis: (hyperthyroidism and depressed RAIU)
1.	Subacute thyroiditis (also known as de Quervain's thyroiditis or granulomatous thyroiditis) 
2.      Silent lymphocytic thyroiditis (often occurs in the postpartum period and is then referred to as "postpartum thyroiditis"
3.	Exogenous thyroid hormone 
     a.	Iatrogenic 
     b.	Factitious 
4.	Struma ovarii
a 48-year-old woman with newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism.  She was clinically suspected of having Grave&#8217;s disease.
Subacute thyroiditis is a benign, self-limited inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland.  
 One particular variety of thyrotoxic subacute thyroiditis is silent lymphocytic thyroiditis.  It is similar in manifestation to subacute granulomatous thyroiditis or de Quervain's thyroiditis, except for the absence of pain, tenderness and prodromal systemic symptoms.
