Examination: 9.0 x 2.5 cm hemangioma crossing the midline and covering an overlying lower lumbar vertebrae and the sacral base. There was a 2-3 mm pit located within a small bluish papule at the level of the 4th and 5th lumbar vertebrae in the midline.

Laboratory: MRI of the lesion revealed a sinus tract in the centerof the lesion extending to the fascia overlying the vertebrae. The lesion was not continuous with the spinal canal. No other abnormalities were noted on spine or brain MRI.
Course: The child was referred to pediatric surgery for excision of the lesion. No other anatomic abnormalities were noted at the time of surgery.
Histopathology: The biopsy shows an intradermal sinus tract lined by colonic type epithelium consistent with an enteric sinus tract. The surrounding and deep dermis show extensive proliferations of small capillaries consistent with a hemangioma.
Case 30 (27th Annual Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, 2003) MID-LINE SACRAL HEMANGIOMA ASSOCIATED WITH A CONGENITAL ENTERIC SINUS CYST
History: One year old Caucasian female with an unremarkable gestational period and normal spontaneous term delivery presented with a midline anomaly in the sacral area.
