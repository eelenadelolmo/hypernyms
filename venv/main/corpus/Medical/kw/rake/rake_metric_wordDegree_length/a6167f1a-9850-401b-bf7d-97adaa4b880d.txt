Unable to move right arm, significant swelling and eccymosis.
Initial casting and immobilization with follow up radiographs.  If adequate healing not occuring, may consider placement of bone chips within the lesion for additional support.
AP Radiograph of Proximal Humerus in internal rotation shows a comminuted, primarily spiral fracture through the right proximal humerus at the junction of the middle and proximal thirds.  The fracture is pathologic, extending through a lytic lesion that extends from the physeal scar to the inferior margin of the fracture site.  The lesion is centrally located, geographic, lucent and thins the endosteum with endosteal ridging  appreciated.  The findings are consistent with a Unicameral Bone Cyst.
Unicameral Bone Cyst with Pathologic Fracture
UBC/SBC - Unicameral Bone Cyst/Simple Bone Cyst
Fibrous Dysplasia
EG - Eosinophilic Granuloma
ABC - Aneurysmal Bone Cyst
Giant Cell Tumor
17 year old male who felt a snap in his right arm while throwing a football.
