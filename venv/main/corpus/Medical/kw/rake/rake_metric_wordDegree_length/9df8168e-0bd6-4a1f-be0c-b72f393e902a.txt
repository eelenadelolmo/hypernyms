The patient has a wobbly gait and appears to be looking for items that he can grab a hold of and steady/support himself as he moves from one position to another.  He reports having weakness in his legs.  He reports sometimes losing his balance.  This type of clinical appearance is commonly associated with spinal stenosis.  Lumbar range of motion limited to 27/60 degrees flexion, 2/25 degrees extension, 6/25 degrees right lateral bending, and 10/25 degrees left lateral bending. The patient reported lower back pain radiating to his right knee during motions. Hip flexors and extensors strength were 4+/5 bilaterally. His left toe flexor was 4+/5. The rest of the patient’s lower extremity range of motion was full and muscle strength was 5/5. 

The patient reported lower back pain radiating to the ipsilateral calf on straight leg test at 54 degrees on the right leg and 55 degrees on the left leg. He also reported lower back pain on prone knee flexion provocation that radiated into the extremities. The patient’s sensation was intact in both of his lower extremities. His Subpatellar reflex was 2+ on the left side and 1+ on the right side and his achilles reflex was +2 on the left side and 1+ on the right side. 

The patient demonstrated weakness on toe walking. He could walk on his heel but reported lower back pain while doing so.
The patient presented for evaluation of the back based on the New York State Guidelines for Determining Permanent Impairment and Loss of Wage Earning Capacity. 

A C4.3 report along with narrative was submitted by the treating chiropractor.  A finding of Class IV and G categorization was made.   (to be addressed in the discussion)

An IME doctor indicated:  "From an orthopaedic point of view based on history, physical findings and review of available medical information, it is my opinion that this claimant has reached maximum medical improvement ... .  Permanency is established using the NYS Guidelines 2012, Chapter II on the back, Table 11.2 for lesion treated surgically."

Additionally he indicated that such this is a Medical Impairment Class 4. He noted that from Table 11.2 the examiner is directed to use Table S11.4, 11.6 and 11.7 to determine placement in range.  He further elaborated: Using the Table on page 65 for positive MRl showing no neurological compromise but clearly abnormal, he gave 4 points. He also gave an additional 6 points for electrodiagnostic studies positive right and left at one (S1) level. He also indicated that for reflex changes, according to Table S 11.4, (Achilles Rt) being present but diminished, an additional 4 points, yielding a total of 14 points. Thus according to Table S11.7(b) there is a Severity Ranking of E.
L3-L4 disk level showed mild hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum without any significant changes. L4-L5 disk showed a mild posterior bulge and prominent facet arthropathy with hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum resulting in severe central spinal stenosis and bilateral lateral recess stenosis. L5-S1 disk level showed changes consistent with postoperative changes with no recurrent disk herniation or central spinal stenosis.

Patient is a 53 y.o. Man who presented to the office for determination of permanent disability. He reports that in 2002, he was picking up a box off of the floor and hurt his back. He underwent back surgery later that year and again in 2003 when the screws and cages that were put in place shifted positions. Prior to his injury, the patient claims he was very active. He could run 5 miles a day and frequently played basketball or went biking. 

Since his injury, the patient has been very physically limited due to lower back pain. He cannot lift anything beyond 15 pounds and cannot walk or stand for 15 minutes without changing positions. He also receives chiropractic treatments 10 times a year which helps reduce his pain.  He is prescribed Lortab which he uses 3-4 times a day as he gets closer to his chiropractic appointment to control his pain.  After chiropractic care he can reduce his Lortab consumption to 1-2 Lortabs per day. 

The patient also reports having diabetes and hypertension for which he takes Metformin and Lotrel respectively. An EMG demonstrated chronic left and right S1 radiculopathies.

As can be seen there is a large discrepancy between the IME doctor and the treating doctor in this case.  The greatest problem of discrepancy that arose was that the IME doctor never addressed the severe spinal stenosis.  The IME doctor only used tables that addressed the areas of spinal surgery and did not address non-surgical areas (i.e. the level of spinal stensosis).  As such this is an error on the part of the IME doctor in assessment minimizing the condition of the patient.

Permanency is established using the New York State guidelines 2012, chapter 11 on the back: table11.2 for surgically treated spine conditions as well as table 11.1 for non-surgical conditions.  On page 54 utilizing table 11.2 the patient is felt to have a class IV medically documented injury with related surgical intervention.  Utilizing tables 11.2 and 11.1 the patient is felt to have residual symptoms, weakness in a myotomal distribution, tension/compression signs, objective clinical findings and where such is consistent with spinal pathology, correlative imaging findings and correlative electrodiagnostic findings as described in the radiculopathy chart (table 11.4).  The symptoms and findings are consistent in part with: The post surgical condition and also as per table 11.1 with soft tissue non-surgical spine conditions.

The L5/S1 level is the site of surgical intervention and the L4/L5 level is the site of non-surgical intervention.  

Tables 11.2 and 11.1 direct the use of tables: S11.4, S11.5, S11.6 as appropriate and S11.7.  Table 11.7 indicates that S11.4(a), S11.4 (b) and S11.6 should be used to determine placement in range for the lumbar spine.

Although the L4-5 level did not undergo surgical intervention,  there are positive findings on MRI evaluation of spinal stenosis, lateral recess stenosis and disc bulge resulting in severe spinal stenotic findings.  There are findings of neurologic compromise on imaging (table 11.4).  Using table 11.4 and relative to imaging there are significant abnormalities that are causative of displaced nerve tissue and/or bony/mechanical nerve root encroachment evident on imaging.  This is noted at the L4/L5 level where bilateral lateral recess stenosis can apply pressure to the nerve roots as well as severe spinal stenosis with disc bulge at the same level resulting in cord/neurologic embarrassment.  As such 16 points were accorded for MRI with neurologic Compromise.  

There are positive electrodiagnostic findings and where 6 points for a positive electrodiagnostic study of chronic S1 radiculopathy bilaterally is given. 

Additionally and apart from the documented EMG findings of radiculopathy, the patient does present with positive straight leg raising which can be attributable to the L4/L5 level on either side and was given 4 points. 

The patient demonstrated an absent Achilles reflex on the right side, as per the evaluation, and was accorded 6 points as per table S11.4.  

He also demonstrated weakness on toe walking (gastrocnemius and soleus muscles with S1 innervation).  As per table S11.6 if such were total weakness 18 points could be afforded.  However, such is not total weakness on exam and clinical judgement suggests a 50% loss of functionality in this regard with motor loss in toe walking.  

Adding the following values: 16 points MRI, 6 points achilles tendon reflex loss, 6 points EMG of S1 radiculopathy bilateral, 4 points for positive straight leg raising and 9 points for toe walking weakness we have  a sum of 43 points that satisfies the range given in Table S11.7 (33-48) page 71 for a G categorization.   

As per NYS Workers" Compensation Board decision 2013 WL 5591248 levels of categorization were related back to the 1996 WCB guides of disability levels.  When not determining permanency, practitioners still use this table for ascribing disability levels.  The case seeks to apply the Medical Impairment Severity Crosswalk (Id, at 120), which creates a range of 0-6 (0 representing no medical impairment, 1 represents 25% medical impairment, 2 represents 33.33% impairment, 3 represents 50% medical impairment, 4 represents 66.66% medical impairment and 5 represents 75% medical impairment and 6 represents total medical impairment).  As such the medical impairment relative to a lumbar spine injury is rendered a percentage of impairment and assigned a severity rating that can be placed within the crosswalk section.  In this case a level of G is seen in the new guides as a class 3.  

However, when interpreting the level of disability/NYS Impairment in this patient"s case a level of 66.66% was rendered.  This is done so that the WCB Judge will understand that although the new guides were followed to arrive at a categorization, the examiner, (contributor GG), also interpreted the disability/impairment in terms of the 1996 guides.  In this case that interpretation  was a moderate to marked partial disability of 66.66%.    

When performing the correlate a minimal disability of approximately 33% was suggested by the IME doctor.  Following deposition, and after the mechanism of arriving at the categorization was explained, (in opposition to the IME assessment), the opposing attorney (off the record), did acknowledge that it was likely that the higher value 66.66% disability will be recognized by the WCB Judge.
