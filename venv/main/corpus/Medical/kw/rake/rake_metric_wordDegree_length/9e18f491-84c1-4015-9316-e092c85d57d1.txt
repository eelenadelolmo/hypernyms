A 1 cm oval mass is attached to the septum pellucidum at the foramen of Monro that demonstrates hyperintensity on T1WI and isointensity on T2WI.  This mass does not enhance.
Colloid (neuroepithelial) cyst of the third ventricle
Giant Cell Astrocytoma
Metastasis
Ependymoma
Subependymoma
Choroid Plexus Papilloma
Cysticercosis
Central Neurocytoma
43 year old hispanic woman with increased frequency of headaches/migraines.
Differential diagnosis for this case included a Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SGCA).  However in those cases, other stigmata of tuberous sclerosis are usually present i.e. cortical/subcortical tubers and subependymal nodules.   Also, the SGCA is usually in the lateral ventricle, attached to the caudate.

Metastasis was also considered however, the patient had no known primary cancer and no constitutional symptoms.  Metastatic lesions also usually enhance.

A subependymoma was felt to be unlikely as these tumors are usually in the 4th or lateral ventricles.

Lastly, a choroid plexus papilloma can rarely present as a third ventricle mass but these tumors usually demonstrate frond-like papillae that enhance.

Besides, the most common mass of the 3rd ventricle is the colloid cyst - in areas not endemic for cysticercosis.
