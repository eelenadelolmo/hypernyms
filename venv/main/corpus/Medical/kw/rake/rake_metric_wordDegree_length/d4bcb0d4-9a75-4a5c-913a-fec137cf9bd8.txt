Visual acuity uncorrected 20/40 OD (correctable to 20/25 w/1.25 diopter hyperopic shift), 20/15 OS. TA= 14 OD, 13 OS. VF/EOM= no deficits. PUPIL= RRL, no APD OU, SLE= WNL OU.  Hertel: OD 18, OS 15. Increased resistance to retropulsion OD, no lid lag, no change with dependent head position or valsalva.  DFE: OD optic nerve normal/no edema, choroidal folds present OD
The patient was closely followed for the rest of her pregnancy w/no changes in ocular status.  She delivered via C-section to avoid increased intraorbital pressure during labor.

Three months post delivery her proptosis has resolved and her uncorrected visual acuity is now 20/20 OU.  

Repeat MRI revealed resolution of the orbital mass.
MRI demonstrated an intraconal mass in the right orbit with contrast enhancement with gadolinium on T1; and, no evidence of hemorrhage.
Cavernous Hemangioma
•	Thyroid Disease (most common cause)
•	Orbital Tumor
•	Orbital vascular malformation
•	Orbital inflammatory pseudotumor
•	Pseudoproptosis (myopia, cranial nerve palsy, enophthalmos of opposing eye)
•	Retrobulbar hemorrhage
•	Trauma with orbital fracture
•	Orbital cellulitis (infectious)
•	Sarcoidosis
27 y/o previously healthy G1P0 presents in her second trimester with a three month history of progressive proptosis and decreased vision in her right eye with unknown etiology

She denies ocular pain, trauma, fevers,and diplopia; but, she does have occasional blurry vision in the affected eye.

POHX: none, PMHX: none, MEDS: Tylenol prn, FHX: non-contributory
Cavernous Hemangioma is one of the most common benign orbital tumors found in adult population.  Common findings include slow onset with imaging studies that show well defined mass found within muscle cone.  Histology shows large vascular channels with smooth muscle in vascular walls.  There have been studies showing a correlation with pregnancy and increased levels of progesterone.  Other case studies claim exacerbation of proptosis during pregnancy with mechanism unclear although large connections to venous system may be distensible in response to changes in venous pressure.  Cavernous hemangioma typically involves careful observation and surgery is warranted due to aggressive nature.
