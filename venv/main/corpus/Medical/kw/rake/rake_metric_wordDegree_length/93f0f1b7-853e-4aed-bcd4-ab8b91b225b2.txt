Clinicians thought they felt multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the axillae and inguinal regions.
No treatment required - but clinicians should recognize this abnormality - especially ENT surgeons.
Axial CT image of the neck demonstrates medial deviation of the left internal carotid artery.  Note that the left internal carotid artery is just below the pharyngeal mucosa in the retropharyngeal fat.  

Curved reconstruction of the axial images delineates the medially deviated course of the left internal carotid artery.

Incidentally, the patient had no lymphadenopathy pathologic by size criteria throughout her neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis study.
