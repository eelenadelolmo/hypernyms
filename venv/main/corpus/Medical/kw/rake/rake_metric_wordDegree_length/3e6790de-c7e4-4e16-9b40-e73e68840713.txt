Unremarkable. CEA (at time of s/p 4 cycle scan): 4.5 ng/ml (normal)
Given the finding of disease recurrence (versus persistence), patient was taken to OR and the metastasis resected.
The routine 1 hour post-injection images are normal.  No hypermetabolism is seen within the liver.  Delayed (Dual Time Point) images now demonstrate a focus of hypermetabolism within the liver--at the same location as the previous abnormality.

Patient has history of colon cancer, with CT negative for metastatic disease.  He was treated with hemicolectomy, after which time a PET/CT was performed, revealing an unsuspected hypermetabolic focus in the liver.  He underwent 4 cycles of chemotherapy, and had a subsequently negative PET/CT at that time.  A follow up PET/CT was performed two months later, which is this case....
The initial scan was negative for disease recurrence. It was only after delayed imaging that the abnormality became apparent.  Delayed images were not performed on the prior "negative" exam after the 4th cycle of chemotherapy, so it is impossible to tell if the abnormality would have also been present at that time.
