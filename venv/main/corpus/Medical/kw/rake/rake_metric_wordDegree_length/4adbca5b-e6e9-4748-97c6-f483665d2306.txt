Texto: 
Subtotal surgical resection.
Radiation therapy was withheld at this point secondary to the low grade pathology.
Homogeneous mass centered in the right petro-clival fissure. Low signal on T1, high on T2, with marked homogeneous enhancement. There is also extension of the tumor through the skull base into the right nasopharynx, anterior to the longus colli muscle and compressing it. The lesion is also producing mass effect in the region of the fossa of Rosenmueller.
Chondrosarcoma of the skull base
Chondrosarcoma
Chordoma (same MRI signal pattern but usually midline)
Metastatic disease
Plasmacytoma (usually low T2 on MRI)
Lymphoma (usually lower signal on T2 and bright DWI)
Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC) from nasopharynx
37 year old woman who presented with headaches.
In this case, 37 year old woman present for routine MRI evaluation for symptoms of headache.  Abnormal lesion was found at the base of the skull which was then worked up with a dedicated MRI for skull base.

Headaches are one of the more common clinical presentations for chondrosarcoma.

Other symptoms include cranial nerve palsies, espcially CN6 because of its proximity to the most common location of the tumor.  Other CN that could be involved are 3, 5, 6, and 8.
