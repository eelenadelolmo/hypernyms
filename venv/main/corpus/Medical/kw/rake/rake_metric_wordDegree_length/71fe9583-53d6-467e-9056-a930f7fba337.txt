Texto: 
Rapid weight gain (40-lbs in one year), round face, stretch marks, facial flushing. 
Elevated  diurnal cortisol, elevated cortisol and ACTH with CRH stimulation test.
Venous sampling from the inferior petrosal sinus reveals a pituitary source of elevated ACTH levels.
The patient underwent TSS surgery and the microadenoma was removed. The postoperative period was uneventful. The patient’s cortisols levels are monitored in a regular basis.
MR Imaging of the pituitary demonstrates a 4,3 x 4,0 x 4,0  mm hypoenhancing lesion in the midline of the anterior and superior portion of the anterior pituitary lobe. Postsurgical changes are noted in the sphenoid sinus and in the remaining pituitary gland. The findings are compatible with a microadenoma.
ACTH-secreting pituitary microadenoma
Differential diagnosis:
-Rathke cleft cyst
-Pars intermedia cyst
-Postoperative changes
-Pituitary hyperplasia
A 9 year-old girl with a history of Cushing’s disease presents with persistent hypercortisolemia. She is s/p transphenoidal surgery (TSS) for pituitary microadenoma performed seven months ago, with a negative pathology report for microadenoma at that time.
This is a typical case of a ACTH-secreting pituitary microadenoma. The persistence of symptoms and elevated cortisols-ACTH levels after TSS lead to further work up which revealed the cause of Cushing’s syndrome.
