Ectopic Intrathoracic Kidney
left diaphragmatic herniation
A 3-year-old male patient admitted to the pediatric ward for cough and difficulty of breathing.

Medical history:  product  of NVD  with birth weight of 3.5 kg and was admitted to NICU  for meconium aspiration , therefore he had recurrent episodes of of wheezing chest  related to hyperreactive  airway disease. 

On the last admission clinical examination  shows  a RR  of 25/mn ; HR 120/mn with normal rhythm ; expiratory wheezing in both lungs without crepitation
Renal ectopia (abnormal renal location) results from a kidney that fails to ascend from its origin in the true pelvis or from a superiorly ascended (thoracic) kidney .

Intrathoracic kidneys have a reported prevalence of less than 1 in 10,000 and represent only 5% of ectopic kidneys(1,3). It is a rare form of renal ectopia. In an examination of 15,919 autopsies done on children, Campbell (7) identified 22 cases of renal ectopia, and only one of these was intrathoracic . Left-sided ectopia is more common, and men are affected three times more often than women(4). It is usually unilateral, but may be bilateral(1,6). Thoracic kidney has been recognized prenatally(2), and it has also appeared after a previously normal chest radiograph (3,4).  High ectopia is usually not associated with functional abnormality and is more commonly an incidental finding on chest x-ray(5) , however There is an increased incidence of ureteropelvic junction obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux, and multicystic renal dysplasia in incompletely ascended kidneys, but not in superiorly ascended ones. Malrotation may be present with the renal pelvis anterior to the kidney. The ureter is elongated. The origin of the renal artery can be at the level of the opposite renal artery, or it may be higher. The adrenal gland may accompany the kidney (6), and one instance in which ipsilateral superior splenic ectopia occurred has been reported(7). In our reported case the left renal ectopia  was isolated  with normal renat function after contrast medium injection ,only a slight anterior rotation of the kidney was seen.

Four forms of intrathoracic ectopy have been reported. Most commonly, as was found in our patient, a thin membrane of diaphragm will cover the kidney, thus making it subdiaphragmatic yet intrathoracic in position (2,8). This is also referred to as a diaphragmatic eventration (4). The embryologic origin is debatable; various authors have proposed either an abnormality in pleuroperitoneal membrane fusion or abnormally high migration of the kidney due to delayed mesonephric involution (9). Traumatic rupture of the diaphragm, Bochdalek's hernia, and supradiaphragmatic ectopic kidney without herniation are less common causes of an intrathoracic kidney(2). Anatomically, four features are commonly found: rotational abnormality, in which the hilum is anterior; elongated ureter; high renal vessel origin; and medial deviation of the lower pole (10). The adrenal gland may or may not be ectopic (2). Our patient had an elongated ureter,   slightly anterior hilum  with elongated ureter  and a left renal artery originating at  the same level as the right artery . The right kidney was normal.

The possibility of an intrathoracic kidney exists with all chest masses, though its likelihood is low. Only one case of renal cell carcinoma was reported (14).Since this is the only report of an intrathoracic kidney harboring renal cell carcinoma, we do not believe evidence exists to suggest an altered incidence of tumor development in orthotopic kidneys, and one should direct further studies according to signs and symptoms. 

CONCLUSION
Thoracic kidney or superior renal ectopia is the rarest of the renal ectopies. The adrenal gland and the spleen may accompany the kidney. Simple chest film combined  with sonography and confirmed by enhanced CT scan after or excretory urography readily allows differentiation from other  masses in the chest thus avoiding unnecessary and even hazardous biopsy or surgery . There is no need to treat the malformation. If there is an associated diaphragmatic hernia or eventration containing bowel or stomach, the diaphragm is repaired.
