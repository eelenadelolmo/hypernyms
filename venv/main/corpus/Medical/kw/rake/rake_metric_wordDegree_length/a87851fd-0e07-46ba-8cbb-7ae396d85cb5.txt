Estropia of the left eye, 6th cranial nerve palsy of the right eye, tongue deviates to the right on extension.  Hemoglobin of 9.7 Hematocrit of 28.9 and ESR of 80. Otherwise labs are within normal limits.
The patient is undergoing chemotherapy according to COG high risk renal tumor protocol.
• Large heterogenous mass of the right kidney, intraspinal mass at T10, bony irregularity of C7, T1, and T11.
• Bone marrow of the calvarium, skull base, and clivus are infiltrated with abnormal enhancing soft tissue extending into the epidural spaces and right cavernous sinus.
• Right renal mass with increased uptake also noted in the bilateral calvarium, skull base, clivus, C1, C2, C7, T1, T11, right scapula, proximal right humerus, right first and anterior fifth ribs, left acetabulum, left femur and right tibia.
Clear Cell Sarcoma of the Kidney
• Clear cell sarcoma,
• Malignant rhabdoid tumor
• Rhabdomyosarcoma
• Wilms Tumor
• PNET
• Neuroblastoma.
10 year old boy with dysphagia, weight loss, slurred speech and double vision.  There is no significant past medical history.
Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney is a neoplasm of childhood with a propensity to metastasize to bone.  In fact, it was previously called Bone metastasizing renal tumor of childhood.  It less frequently metastasizes to lung, abdomen, retroperitoneum, brain, and liver. As a result, both conventional radiographic and scintigraphic skeletal survey are recommended.  It represents 3% of pediatric renal tumors and has a slight male predominance.  

The usual presentation is abdominal mass noted by a caregiver.  Physical findings typically include a palpable unilateral abdominal mass.  Hypertension and hematuria are also associated findings.
The origin of clear cell sarcoma has not been established, however, the cell of origin has been suggested to be renal mesenchymal with neural markers.  

The imaging findings typically demonstrate a large unicentric mass that markedly distorts or replaces the kidney.  Cystic foci are typically present as well as foci of necrosis and hemorrhage.  As previously stated, there is a propensity for the tumor to metastasize to bone as in this case.

At presentation, radical nephrectomy is the initial treatment of choice if the tumor is resectable, along with chemotherapy and radiatio.  If the lesion is not resectable then chemotherapy is administered and an attempt at resection may be made if the tumor responds to therapy.
