Texto: 
bilateral globe rupture, left greater than right with lid and numerous facial lacerations.
Enucleation of left eye and repair and removal of foreign bodies from right eye.
left eye has many superficial overlying foreign bodies with irregular (decompressed) contour and layering hyperdense hemorrhage dependently.  Note superior orbital roof fracture with foreign body or bony fragment that has been pushed up into the left frontal lobe.  There is a large adjacent skin laceration.

Right eye also has many superfical foreign bodies and one radiopaque foreign body within the posterior chamber, but it maintains a normal shape.
