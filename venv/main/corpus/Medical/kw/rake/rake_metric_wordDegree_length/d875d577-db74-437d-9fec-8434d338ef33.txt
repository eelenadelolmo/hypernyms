Fracture of the distal head of the fifth metacarpal with palmar angulation
Girl gang fracture
Boxer's fracture (from hitting a wall or person usually while drunk)
A series of radiographs from a number of 17 to 20 year old women who are participating in "jumping in" rituals of acceptance of new members into their gang.
