The child has multiple cuts, sores, burns, and bruises of various ages.  Her response to pain is blunted.  She exhibits a stare of "frozen watchfulness."  Innumerable nits from a lice infestation are readily apparent in her hair.  The mother engages in circumlocution when questioned about the child’s injuries.
The patient was transferred to a tertiary pediatric center for additional care.

The mother was transferred to the county jail to await her arraignment hearing.

•Liver denser than blood (anemia)

2 year old girl presents to ER at the insistance of her mother's probation officer.  The mother has a history of incarceration for armed robbery and prior perpetration of child abuse.  She has five children in her custody.
This is a classic case of child abuse from a location were child abuse is endemic. However, some cases of abuse are subtle. A high level of vigilance should be maintained by radiologists whenever they diagnose a fracture in a child under 30 month's of age.  

Additional information regarding the child's history and physical examination, with particular emphasis on the reported mechanism, should be solicited from the ER staff.
