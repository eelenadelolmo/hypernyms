Texto: 
The child has multiple cuts, sores, burns, and bruises of various ages.  Her response to pain is blunted.  She exhibits a stare of "frozen watchfulness."  Innumerable nits from a lice infestation are readily apparent in her hair.  The mother engages in circumlocution when questioned about the childâ€™s injuries.
The patient was transferred to a tertiary pediatric center for additional care.

The mother was transferred to the county jail to await her arraignment hearing.
Signs of abuse:
â€¢scar from a cigarette burn 
â€¢Multiple bruises of multiple ages
â€¢Multiple fractures of multiple ages

Signs of neglect:
â€¢Nits and lice
â€¢Onychomycosis
â€¢growth arrest lines
â€¢Liver denser than blood (anemia)

Incidental finding
â€¢radiopaque particles in stomach
Non accidental trauma
None in this case but a myriad of other conditions in subtle cases including:

â€¢Accidental injury
â€¢Bleeding diatheses
â€¢Seizures
â€¢Osteogenesis imperfecta
2 year old girl presents to ER at the insistance of her mother's probation officer.  The mother has a history of incarceration for armed robbery and prior perpetration of child abuse.  She has five children in her custody.
This is a classic case of child abuse from a location were child abuse is endemic. However, some cases of abuse are subtle. A high level of vigilance should be maintained by radiologists whenever they diagnose a fracture in a child under 30 month's of age.  

Additional information regarding the child's history and physical examination, with particular emphasis on the reported mechanism, should be solicited from the ER staff.
