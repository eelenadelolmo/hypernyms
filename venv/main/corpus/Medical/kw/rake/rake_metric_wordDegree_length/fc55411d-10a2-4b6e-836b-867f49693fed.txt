Physical exam was unremarkable.
During the night of day of life 4, the child had progress decrease in urine output.  This was not relieved by NICU  attempts to reposition/ replace the bladder catheter. 

Emergent VCUG reveals during the catheter manipulation, that the ballon of the Foley catheter had been inflated in the distended posterior urethra. 

Repositioning of the catheter re-established urine flow, but subsequent follow-up reveal moderate congenital renal dysplasia.  

Cystoscopy with transurethral incision of the posterior urethral valves at 5 oclock and 7 oclock to relieve the obstruction.
Since the patient was not producing urine, a catheter was placed to establish flow.  The balloon was inflated  and was left in place.  Urine flow was initially adequate, but diminished over time.  

Imaging via US and X ray flouroscopic voiding cysto-urethrogram assisted with making the diagnosis of PUV's. Ultrasound renal echography, which was performed initially, showed bilateral obstruction with secondary dilation of the ureter and calyces, changes suspicious for posterior urethral valves.

X ray flouroscopic voiding cysto-urethrogram shows trabeculated bladder with distention of the posterior urethra, which was consistent with posterior urethral valves.  There is also incomplete emptying of the bladder on post void imaging.  The visualized osseous structures appear normal.  There is no evidence of masses, cysts, or calcifications.
Posterior Urethral Valve
Posterior urethral valves.  Urethral atresia.  Renal insufficiency.  Detrusor sphincter dyssynergy.
Patient is a term newborn born by spontaneous vaginal delivery which was complicated by oligohydramnios, hydronephrosis, and hydroureter.
This patient is on the transplant list for kidney replacement.
