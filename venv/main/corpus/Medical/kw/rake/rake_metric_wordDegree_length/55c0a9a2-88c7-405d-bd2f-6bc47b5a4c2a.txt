Physical examination reveals positive Lhermitte sign (Lhermitte sign is an electric shock-like sensation that occurs when flexing or moving the neck. This sensation radiates down the spine, often into the legs, arms, and occasionally, the trunk.)
The patient also underwent a C-SPINE and TH-SPINE MRI scan which have not revealed any new or active MS lesions.   The patient is in good clinical condition without any significant motor or sensory deficits.
In the light of the new imaging and clinical findings ,  the patient is placed on a different  therapy.
Multiplanar MR Imaging demonstrates the presence of two new demyelinating lesions in juxtacortical white matter of the left frontal lobe compared with a previous Brain MRI scan performed three months ago. These new lesions enhance vividly after gadolinium -based contrast administration, indicating active disease.
Multiple Sclerosis- active stage.
Differential diagnosis includes: ADEM ,sarcoid, vasculitis, ischemic-hypoxic lesions,  Susac syndrome.
Tumefactive multiple sclerosis must be differentiated from neoplasm.
A 35-year old woman with a history of relapsing - remitting MS, treated with immunomodulation therapy. She presents now with a new onset of numbness in both lower extremities.
Active MS lesions demonstrate enhancement following gadolinium- based contrast administration.
This is due to the breakdown of the brain blood barrier from inflammatory inflitration combined with features of myelin destruction. Apart from this easily identifiable finding in conventional MRI, it is important to remember that normal-appearing white matter outside the plaques also frequently demonstrates immunopathologic changes including microglial activation, T-cell infiltration, and perivascular lymphocytic cuffing.
