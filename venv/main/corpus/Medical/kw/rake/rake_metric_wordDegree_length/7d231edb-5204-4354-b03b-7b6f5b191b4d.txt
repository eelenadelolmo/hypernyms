PE - right lower quadrant abdominal pain
Labs - UA positive ketones
             WBC 13.4 with 85% segs
Findings were communicated directly to the ER physician and surgical team.  The patient proceeded to urgent appendectomy overnight.  

Pathology results were as follows:
-Specimen size 9.0 x 2.0 x 0.9 cm
-Serosal surface with moderate amount of white fibrinous exudate but no evident perforation
-Largest single wall thickness measured 0.4 cm
CT with oral and IV contrast demonstrates an enlarged appendix with incomplete proximal contrast filling ("arrow sign") and surrounding inflammation but no evident rupture.  A small quantity of right pelvic free fluid without abscess.
Acute Suppurative Appendicitis with Serositis
Acute Appendicitis
Acute Suppurative Appendicitis with Serositis
Diverticulitis
33 year-old man with fever, nausea, loss of appetite and right lower quadrant abdominal pain.
This is a good example of a case in which the clinical scenario strongly suggested appendicitis and the CT demonstrated acute appendicitis.  Performance and interpretation of the CT was prioritized within our department and showed no evidence of perforation or abscess.  Following prompt resection, Pathology confirmed no perforation.
