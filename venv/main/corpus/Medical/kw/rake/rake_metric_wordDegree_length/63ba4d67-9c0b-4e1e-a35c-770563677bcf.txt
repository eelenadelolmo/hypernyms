There was no evidence of shunt failure in this patient.
Normal sized posterior fossa with a fourth ventricle which communicates with a large posterior fossa cyst.  The vermis is hypoplastic.  There is no torcular-lambdoid inversion ( as evaluated by MPR imaging).
Dandy Walker Varient
Dandy Walker malformation
Dandy Walker varient
Arachnoid cyst of the posterior fossa
Giant cysterna magna
2 year old female with VP shunt and fever of unknown origin.
The enlarged posterior fossa cyst can cause obstruction in these patients requiring the placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, as was performed in this patient. Heterotopias and callosal dysgenisis occur in about 20% of cases.
