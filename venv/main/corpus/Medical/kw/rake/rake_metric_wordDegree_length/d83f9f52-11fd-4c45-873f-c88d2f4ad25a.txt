Fungal sinusitis
1)  Fungal sinusitis

2)  Chronic bacterial sinusitis with inspissated secretions

3)  Inverted papilloma

4)  Hemorrhage-- NO history of trauma or barotrauma
15 y/o female with chronic nasal congestion
Chronic (noninvasive form) of fungal sinusitis is most common type.  Occurs usually in immunocompetent, non-atopic patients.

Variety of organisms: aspergillosis, mucormycosis, candidiasis, histo, crypto, coccidio, etc. 

Imaging findings: 
Early disease: nonspecific mucosal inflammation  
A/F levels uncommon

CT:
mass-like with hyperdense regions (round or linear Ca++) deposits
Thick or remodeled sinus bone and associated mucosal thickening

MR:
Usually low signal associated with high protein secretions and foci of Ca++
