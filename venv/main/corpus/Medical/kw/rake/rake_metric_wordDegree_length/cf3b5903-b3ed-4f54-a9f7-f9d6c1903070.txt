ABD: Midepigastric tenderness.
LABS: Hyperbilirubinemia. Mildly elevated LFTs. Elevated amylase and lipase.
Therapy for underlying metastatic pancreatic carcinoma.
CT: Cavernous transformation of the thrombosed portal vein occurs when small collateral veins adjacent to the portal vein expand and replace the obliterated portal vein. In this case, PV thrombosis is secondary to a pancreatic primary neoplasm with evidence of metastatic spread. The PV thrombus may be secondary to direct tumor extension or may be the sequelae of a paraneoplastic syndrome (hypercoagulable state). Peripheral hypodense liver lesions are likely metastases.
Portal Vein Thrombosis with cavernous transformation in metastatic pancreatic cancer
1.  Tumor: Direct invasion of the PV, PV compression or paraneoplastic hypercoagulability 
2.  Cirrhosis
3.  Infection (esp. in children)
4.  Inflammation (pancreatitis)
5.  Inherited coagulation disorders
6.  Idiopathic
51 year old Asian woman with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea. 20 lb weightloss.
Portal vein obstruction does not affect liver function unless the patient has an underlying liver disease such as cirrhosis. This is partially due to a rapid arterial buffer response, with compensatory increased flow of the hepatic artery maintaining the total hepatic blood flow. Formation of collaterals occurs rather rapidly as well, and they have been described as early as 12 days after acute thrombosis, though the average time to formation is approximately 5 weeks. 

The development of a collateral circulation, with its attendant risk of variceal hemorrhage, is responsible for most of the complications and is the most common manifestation of portal vein obstruction. Other sequelae of the subsequent portal hypertension, such as ascites, are less frequent. Rarely, the thrombosis extends from the portal vein to the mesenteric arcades, leading to bowel ischemia and infarction.
