Patient never regained conciousness after sedation was removed.
Patient was pronounced dead 24 hours later.
CT of the head aproximately 3 hours after termination of surgery demonstrates symmetric and complete reversal of normal gray and white matter densities in the brain.
Anoxic Brain Injury
Symmetric brain injury from
- hypotenstion
- hypoxia
- cardiogenic arrest
- carbon monoxide exposure 
- metabolic
62 year old white male reports to SICU after an aborted surgical attempt to correct a dysfunctional mitral valve.  Surgery was stoped after performing the throacotomy because patient's face turned "blue" and started to swell as the surgery progressed.
This is a good example of a  case that was so profoundly yet so symmetrically abnormal it was nearly missed.  It proves the axiom that "symmetric findings in the brain are either normal or usually very bad."
