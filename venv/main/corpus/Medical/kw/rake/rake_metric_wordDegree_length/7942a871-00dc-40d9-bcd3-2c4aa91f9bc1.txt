Texto: 
Patient presented with acute onset of headache and left-sided weakness.
Due to the peripheral position of the perfusion defects and absence of a proximal occlusion on CTA (not shown), it was elected to treat with intravenous tPA rather than intraarterial intervention.  Additional considerations included patientâ€™s multiple comorbidities and multiple recent arteriotomies with complicated access.

At the time of her second head CT her symptoms consisted of left facial droop, left hemineglect and left pronator drift.  Her neurologic symptoms neither improved nor worsened with IV tPA.
Stroke protocol consisted of noncontrast head CT, CT perfusion mapping, and CTA of the head and neck.

Initial noncontrast head CT scan demonstrated no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.  No dense middle cerebral artery sign or evidence of loss of gray and white matter differentiation.  There was subtle asymmetry of right parietal sulci compared to left.

CT perfusion demonstrated abnormally prolonged MTT (mean transit time), in a wedge-shaped configuration, involving the distal M3 distribution of the right MCA in the right posterior parietal lobe and posterior frontal lobe.  

Cerebral blow flow (rCBF) in these two regions was also mildly diminished.  

Cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in these two regions was relatively normal; however, within the centers of the two wedge-shaped areas of abnormal perfusion there were small areas of decreased blood volume.  The summary tissue at risk map indicates a small region of core infarct with a larger region of penumbra. 

CT angiogram of the neck and head demonstrated no proximal occlusion to the anterior or posterior circulation.  

MRI performed 6 days later demonstrates subacute infarct in the region of ischemia noted acutely with increased flair and diffusion-weighted signal in the area of interest.

Vasculitis
82-year-old woman with history of significant coronary and peripheral artery disease with sudden onset of headache and left-sided weakness during a peripheral arterial interventional procedure in the cardiology catheterization lab.
