Surgical resection
Film #1: Non-enhanced CT image shows a slightly decreased attenuating focal mass in the pancreatic body with diffuse atrophic changes. Several enlarged peripancreatic lymph nodes are present with the largest measuring 13 mm on short axis diameter.

Film #2: Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT image shows a 2.5 x 4.3 cm unenhancing, hypodense mass in the pancreatic body. No metastases were seen in the liver. 

Film #3: Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT image (on liver window) shows a 7 mm obstructed pancreatic duct (arrow) surrounded by contrast-enhanced pancreatic parenchyma seen distal to the pancreatic mass.
PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA
1.)Most exocrine pancreatic tumors; 2.)Lymphoma; 3.)Pancreatic endocrine tumors (mostly non-functional).
56 year old male with severe upper abdominal pain, left greater than right, for 1 week.
A majority of non-endocrine pancreatic carcinomas, up to 75-85%, are ductal cell adenocarcinomas[1,2]. The tumor is highly lethal and is usually unresectable at presentation. The average survival time of a patient with this disease is only 8 months or less. These tumors usually occur in the seventh decade of life.  

Currently, computed tomography (CT) is the most commonly used imaging method in the assessment of pancreatic tumors. The sensitivity of CT detection of pancreatic tumors is reported to be more than 90% when direct or indirect signs are used for diagnosis[1]. However, the potential to differentiate exocrine (non-endocrine) tumors of the pancreas is limited. 

On non-enhanced CT imaging, there is often a slightly decreased attenuating pancreatic mass seen. Following rapid bolus of contrast injection, the tumor usually appears as a hypodense mass with ill-defined borders. Calcification is almost never present within the mass. Indirect signs of a pancreatic mass include abrupt obstruction of the common bile and/or pancreatic duct and atrophy of pancreatic tissue beyond the tumor. The typical distribution of ductal cell adenocarcinoma is as follows: 60â€“70% at the pancreatic head, 10% the body, 5% the tail, 5% both head and body, and about 10% body and tail [1]. 

Those who present with a pancreatic head mass often have symptoms earlier than in those with pancreatic tail masses, mainly due to symptomatic obstruction of the biliary or pancreatic duct. Radiographic assessment of resectability is critical because surgical resection offers the only hope of cure[2].  However, the surgery itself carries a high morbidity. Resectable patients may live 1-2 years. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilation of the bile or pancreatic ducts or combined dilation of both the bile and pancreatic ducts without an identifiable pancreatic head mass.
