Left lower extremity tenderness on physical exam.  

Pertinent laboratory: 
WBC 6.8 cells/mm3. 
Normal INR, PT, and aPTT
CMP WNL
Idiopathic osteonecrosis lesions are treated conservatively, and this man was given analgesics for pain with close follow-up appointments for observation.  In the event of progression, surgical intervention may be required.
Initial plain film lateral and oblique radiographs of left ankle demonstrate central medullary hypodensities in distal tibial shaft and metadiaphysis.

MRI left ankle with sagittal T1 and sagittal STIR images shows diffuse pattern of marrow edema isolated to distal tibia extending to tibial plafond.  Proximal extent of the marrow edema is not visualized.

Noncontrast CT of left lower extremity was acquired as the superior extent of tibial involvement was not able to be visualized on MRI ankle.  It shows heterogeneous appearance of medullary space throughout tibia and visualized portion of distal femur.  No periosteal reaction.

Whole body Tc99 bone scan (delayed imaging) demonstrates diffuse increased uptake in left tibia with increased uptake also seen in distal femur. 

MRI of the left lower extremity for the mid femur to the ankle demonstrates circumscribed geographic lesions in distal femur and proximal tibia central marrow that demonstrate low T1 signal and peripheral enhancement with heterogenous high signal on STIR sequences.  No abnormal soft tissue fluid collections are noted.
Osteonecrosis
1. Osteonecrosis
2. Osteomyelitis
3. Stress injury
4. Enchondroma (based on plain film)
26 y/o man presents to orthopedic clinic with localized left lower extremity pain not relieved with pain medications.  He has had no recent trauma or surgeries in the left lower extremity.

He was involved in an MVA trauma 17 months previously in which he developed left foot and ankle pain and swelling.  MRI at the time demonstrated bone marrow edema and left hindfoot lesions. He was placed on two week oral steroid course and the pain and swelling resolved over the following year.  

Four months after his initial trauma,  he developed acute pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocysts secondary to traumatic pancreatic duct rupture.
This patient demonstrates typical findings of osteonecrosis on plain film, bone scan, and MR.  On radiography, there are typical findings to include well-defined subchondral lucencies with background bone sclerosis.  On bone scan, increased uptake of radiotracers indicative of repair process is noted.  

On MR, geographic T1 hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity in involved areas representing bone marrow edema and necrosis. 

His clinical course began one month after his trauma.  The trauma may have been the inciting factor for his osteonecrosis.  As pancreatitis is a known risk factor for osteonecrosis, this may have contributed.  Pancreatitis can cause fatty emboli to occlude the vasculature supplying the involved area.  

The involved osteonecrotic areas of his left lower extremity are currently being monitored for progression, as complications can include fracture and/or collapse of the osseous structures.
