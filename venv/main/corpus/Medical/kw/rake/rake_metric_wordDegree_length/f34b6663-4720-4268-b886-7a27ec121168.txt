Physical exam notable for exquisitely tender right groin and a distended abdomen.  Lab data were noncontributory
Sonographic compression with close interval followup.
CT images demonstrate a large retroperitoneal hematoma with a cystic fluid collection within the right hemipelvis suggesting that the puncture site was above the inguinal ligament.
US images demonstrates the diagnostic presentation of a pseudoaneurysm with echogenic swirls within the hemorrhage cavity, the ying-yang sign, and to and frow flow during the cardiac cycle.  
Post-compression view shows absence of flow within the neck of the pseudoaneurysm.  A temporal plot of the patients mean blood pressure shows improvement after successful compression of the pseudoaneurysm and the administration of blood products and fluid.  

The amount of retro-peritoneal bleeding suggests that the puncture was made above the inguinal ligament; this is a complication which makes direct compression of the arterial puncture site far more difficult to acheive.
Retroperitoneal bleeding associated with a high puncture and distal external iliace artery pseudoaneurysm
Pseudoaneurysm
the reversal of flow between systole and dyastole rules out a AV fistula (which demonstrate low resistant turbulent flow across the connection between the femoral artery and femoral vein continuosly throughout the cardiac cycle)
57 year old male with recent history of cardiac catheterization, now hemodynamically unstable.
Editors note: although this patient was treated with compression under real time sonographic guidance.  This technique which takes a great deal of time and concentration, is now almost of historical interest only.  Pseudoaneuysms caused by femoral artery punctures are now treated with direct thrombin injection which treats them instantaneously.
