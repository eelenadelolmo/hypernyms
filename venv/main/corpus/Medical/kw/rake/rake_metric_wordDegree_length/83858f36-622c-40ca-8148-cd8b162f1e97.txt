Non-contributory.  Plain radiographs were obtained.
The patient underwent open repair of the AAA.  Unfortunately, this patient was not a candidate for an endovascular repair with a stent or graft.

This 80 y.o. man, with a prior history of DVT, presents now with back pain
This particular patient ended up in the emergency room due to back pain.  Plain film as shown was remarkable for prominent vascular calcifications.  At this time, the ER physician was strongly encouraged to evaluate the patient for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).

Subsequent CT imaging as shown demonstrated a 5.4 cm infrarenal AAA, along with a 4.4 cm descending thoracic aortic aneurysm.

At our medical center, the vascular surgeon needed to know the following in order to decide between an endovascular versus open repair:
1. Center-of-flow distance from the ostium of the lowest renal artery to the bifurcation of the aorta
2. True luminal diameter of the infrarenal aorta 1.5 cm from the lowest renal artery ostium
3. The true length of the bilateral common iliac arteries (from the aortic bifucation to the CIA bifurcation to external and internal iliac arteries).
