Whole body bone scan is being performed.
As prescribed by specialist.
The nuclear medicine bone scan images demonstrate absence of renal activity in the expected anatomic locations of the kidneys.  Prominent activity is noted within the bony structures.  Faint activity is noted in the right iliac fossa from a functioning renal transplant.  The CT images demonstrate a RLQ renal transplant.
Pseudo-superscan: a normal variant.
Presuming this is a "superscan:"
Widespread metastatic disease
   Prostate cancer
   Lung cancer
   Breast cancer
   Lymphoma
Metabolic bone disorders
   Renal disease
   Renal osteodystrophy
   Hyperparathyroidism
   Paget's disease
55 year old man with chronic renal failure, on daily hemodialysis.
The nuclear medicine images could be mistaken for a "superscan," indicative of widespread metastatic disease or of a metabolic bone disorder.  In this particular patient, this is a normal study.  This patient has chronic renal failure and has undergone renal transplant.  The transplant site was the right lower quadrant (seen on CT images), and the faint activity of the functioning transplant is mostly obscured by adjacent osseous structures.  This "pseudo superscan" is therefore a variant of normal.
