No metabolic abnormality.
Resection, if complete, is usually sufficient.  It has not yet been decided if this patient will undergo additional Tx.
Large, solid mass in the left cerebellar hemisphere with ill-defined margins and significant surrounding T2 signal abnormality representing vasogenic edema.  This exerts mass effect upon and displaces the 4th ventricle.  Mild hydrocephalus.  Diffuse, heterogeneous enhancement following IV gadolinium infusion.  CT scan demonstrates a notably low attenuation mass, and inferior displacement of the cerebellar tonsils to the level of the foramen magnum.

His mother provides a history of increasing headaches over past month, gait disturbances, and possible seizure activity.
The mass arises from the left cerebellar hemisphere and not the 4th ventricle, and is hypodense on CT.  These findings make medulloblastoma far less likely.  A mass entirely outside the ventricle makes ependyoma less likely.  While pilocytic astrocytomas (PA) are usually cystic with an enhancing mural nodule, this case represents the less common solid variant.  Approximately 85% of posterior fossa astrocytomas in childhood are pilocytic - the remainder are fibrillary-diffuse.  Pilocytic astrocytomas are WHO Grade 1; whereas fibrillary may be Grade 2-4. Enhancement in PA is almost universal.  Enhancement in diffuse astrocytoma is associated with vascular changes and a higher tumor grade - either Grade 3 or Grade 4.
