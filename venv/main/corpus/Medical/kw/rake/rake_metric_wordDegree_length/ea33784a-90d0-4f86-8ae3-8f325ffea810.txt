Texto: 
On examination, the right upper quadrant of the abdomen was exquisitely tender and there was a positive Murphy‚Äôs sign.
The patient was managed conservatively (non-operatively).
Radiographs of the chest and abdomen were performed and compared to an exam from one year prior.  A new air-fluid level is noted in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen with a paucity of bowel loops seen in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Computed tomography (CT) examination was performed.  The CT images demonstrate new interposition of the cecum between the liver and anterior right diaphragm.
Chilaiditi Syndrome
‚Ä¢ Chilaiditi Syndrome
‚Ä¢ Volvulus
‚Ä¢ Appendicitis
A 65-year-old woman presented with acute right upper quadrant pain.
In 1865, Cantini made the first radiological description of intestinal hepatodiaphragmatic interposition. Beclere reported similar findings in a patient in 1899.  The eponym, Chilaiditi Syndrome, is attributed to Dr. Demetrius Chilaiditi, a Turkish radiologist who described the radiographic findings in 1910.  Chilaiditi Syndrome refers to the symptomatic interposition of bowel (usually hepatic flexure of the colon) between the liver and anterior right diaphragm or rarely the posterior subphrenic space and may be thought of as a type of internal abdominal hernia.  The syndrome is characterized by episodic abdominal pain which is rarely associated with bowel obstruction and/or volvulus of the ectopic bowel loop. 

The key radiographic finding is an air-filled bowel loop projecting caudal to the right diaphragm. This radiographic finding may be encountered incidentally in up to 0.28% of radiographs.  In asymptomatic patients, the finding is called ‚ÄúChilaiditi‚Äôs Sign.‚Äù  Potential causes for the ectopic bowel findings may include absent or lax colonic or hepatic suspensory ligaments, redundant colon, or right diaphragm paralysis or eventration.  In the radiologic evaluation, additional radiographs and/or cross-sectional imaging may be needed to exclude a subdiaphragmatic abscess or pneumoperitoneum.

The hallmark of therapy is conservative as surgical intervention is rarely indicated.  As for non-operative treatments, bowel decompression appears to be both diagnostic and therapeutic.  With failed conservative measures, surgical intervention ranging from a coloplexy to varying degrees of colectomy may be required.
