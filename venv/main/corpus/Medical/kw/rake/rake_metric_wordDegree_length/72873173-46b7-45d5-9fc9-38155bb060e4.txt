Neurological examination shows neck stiffness.
No evidence of any other focal neurorlogical abnormalities.
Labs are within normal limits.
Patient was operated by neurosurgery.
On followup examination no evidence of the AVM noted on preoperative Cerebral Angiograms.
Non-contrast CT scan shows hyperdense material in the body and temporal horn of left lateral ventricle and in the fourth ventricle.

On MRI of brain, on Gradient echo images confirmed the focal haemorrhage in the fourth ventricle, in the left lateral ventricle,  and miniminal blood products in the occipital horns - all suggestive of a recent haemorrhage.
An abnormality is present in the inferior left temporal horn, that is probably secondary to a vascular malformation such as AVM.

Cerebral angiogram shows an AVM or shunt between left middle cerebral artery and left transverse sinus.
Arteriovenous Malformation
Meningitis
Ruptured aneurysm
Arteriovenous Malformation
Choroid plexus hemorrhage
26 yrs healthy young woman with a historyy of severe headache.  No history of trauma or any ohter medical disorders.
