â€¢ 11 mm endometrial stripe is seen within the uterus with a tiny cystic focus in the fundal portion.
â€¢1.8 cm right ovarian mass with yolk sac. No fetal pole or cardiac activity was visible on grayscale, doppler or M-mode.
â€¢ A small amount of peritoneal fluid is present within the cul-de-sac.
Ectopic Pregnancy
With a BHCG of 2700, the differential of a complex right ovarian mass includes ectopic pregnancy, heterotopic pregnancy, and corpus luteum cyst. The small cystic focus in the fundal endometrium may represent an early gestational sac or decidual cyst.
