Elevated amylase, lipase, liver associated enzymes and bilirubin
On Ultrasound imaging the patient had mild gallbladder wall thickening to 4 mm and common bile duct dilation to 9 mm. Neither an obstructing lesion nor the pancreas was visualized on ultrasound.

On CT scan of the pancrease, there was mild gall bladder wall thickening, CBD dilatation, inflammatory fat stranding around the pancreas and duodenal small bowel and a circular hyperdensity in the distal CBD.
Gallstone Pancreatitis
Following Ultrasound:

1) Gallstone
2) Tumor: pancreatic, cholangiocarcinoma, ampullary/duodenal carcinoma or metastasis.
3) Benign or inflammatory stricture.
4) iatrogenic stricture
5) Primary sclerosing Cholangitis.
6) Primary Biliary Cirrhosis
7) Ascarasis parasitic obstruction
74 yo male who presented to the ER with a three day history of progressive epigastric and right upper quadrant pain.
