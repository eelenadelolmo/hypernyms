Normal PE and no specific lab abnormalities
n/a.
There is a curvilinear calcific density overlying the trachea on the lateral view in an unusual orientation for a foreign body. There is also a calcified AP window lymph node.
Axillary aluminum chlorhydrate residue (deodorant).
Skin appendages.
artifact.
Non-contributory;
Screen for military special duty.
With the positioning of the arms on lateral, the axillary radiodense deodorant now overlies the tracea.  Could be mistaken for significant abnormality on lateral view, if not observed on the PA in the expected location.
