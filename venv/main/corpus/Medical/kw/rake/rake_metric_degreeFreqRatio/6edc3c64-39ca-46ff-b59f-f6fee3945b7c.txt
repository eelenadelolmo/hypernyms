PHYSICAL EXAM: Wt: 7.11 kg (0-5th percentile), Ht: 66 cm (3-5th percentile), Head circumference: 41.6 cm (3rd percentile), Temp: 37 C GEN: Patient was a pleasant child in no acute distress. HEAD: Microcephalic, although proportional to the rest of her parameters. Anterior and posterior fontanelles were open and flat. FACIES: No striking dysmorphic facial features. Well-developed philtrum and upper lip. External eyes and ears appear normal. CARDIAC: No murmurs. ABDOMINAL: No organomegaly or masses. NEUROLOGIC: Increased muscle tone both appendicular and axial. Head lag is noted when pulled up to a sitting position. There is persistence of some primitive reflexes including rooting reflex,automatic walking, and stepping reflex. Cortical thumbs bilaterally and fists were seldom open. Tongue thrust deviated to right side. Brisk deep tendon reflexes bilaterally. LABS: All labs within normal limits, including neonatal labs.
Patient was followed by pediatric geneticist, a 
developmental pediatrician, pediatric neurologist, pediatric orthopedist, and a pediatric gastroenterologist for management of her failure to thrive.  Genetic counseling was offered to the patient’s family.  Patient also received occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech therapy.  Unfortunately, the patient passed away on 02/13/2007 from complications of her conditions.
MRI of brain without contrast revealed bilateral closed lip schizencephaly through the parietal lobes. Prominent cleft extends through each parietal lobe to the ependyma of the lateral ventricles. The cleft is lined with gray matter. The septum pellucidum is absent. Optic nerves are visible as is the optic chiasm. Multiple areas of cortical dysplasia involve the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes bilaterally. The white matter does not arborize normally into the cortical gray matter. There are areas of abnormal thickened cortical gray matter with blurring of the interface between the gray and white matter. On T2 weighted images, there is low signal intensity myelination in the middle cerebellar peduncles. The genu and splenium of the corpus callosum and in the anterior and posterior rims of the internal capsules with early myelination in the corona radiata bilaterally. No extra-axial fluid collection is seen. Normal flow void is demonstrated in the major intracranial vessels

Patient presented with history of developmental delay after having failed to reach normal developmental milestones. The patient was born at 38 weeks gestation by spontaneous vaginal delivery. Pregnancy was uncomplicated. The patient’s mother denied use of alcohol, and the occurrence of high fevers, rashes, or other illness during the pregnancy. She did endorse smoking approximately ? pack of cigarettes throughout the pregnancy. Mother reports normal fetal movement. Patient weighed 6 lbs 3 oz and was 18 ? inches in length at birth, and had a normal hospital stay. Mother was 20 years of age at time of birth and father was 37 years of age. There is no family history of developmental delay. The patient’s mother has one previous healthy daughter from a prior relationship, and the patient’s father has five healthy children by a different partner. Mother reports patient showed normal development until about 6 months of age. At presentation, mother reports that patient is still unable to roll over from prone to supine, and also lacks ability to sit or crawl. In addition, she has not developed any midline play with her hands, is unable to hold a bottle, and continues to be fisted. Patient is able to vocalize with coos.
