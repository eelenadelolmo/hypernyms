Physical exam- markedly erythematous posterior pharynx with pustules, shotty posterior cervical adenopathy.

Labs- WBC= 20.5 K 

ENT Surgical drainage demonstrated retrophargyeal abcess.  Throat culture subsequently revealed 4+ Group A Beta Hemmolytic Strep.
ENT drainage and appropriate antibiotic therapy.  Monitor airway.
Markedly prominent prevertebral soft tissues on c-spine lateral view.
Retropharyngeal abscess
C-Spine trauma (if history correlates)
Mucosal space mass- neoplastic (SCC, NPC, Lymphoma)
Parapharyngeal mass- lipoma, abcess, neoplastic
Retropharyngeal mass- abcess, lymphoma, nodal mets
Prevertebral mass- abcess, osteomyelitis, chordoma
Four year old boy with 4 day history of sore throat, worse in the last 24 hours.  Difficulty swallowing, poor appetite.  Parents noticed the patient slobbering for the past several hours prior to ED admission.
Retropharyngeal abcess formation occurs most commonly in infants and children up to age 14.  The abcess may result from pharyngitis (as in this case), pharyngeal trauma, or dental infection.  Clinical findings include hyperextension of the neck, gurgling respirations, and puddling of saliva.  Complications include rupture with subsequent aspiration and contiguous extension into the posterior mediastinum and lateral pharyngeal space.  Typically polymicrobial, the most common causitive bacteria include Strep. pyogenes, Group C Beta-Hemolytic Strep., and Staph. Aureus.
