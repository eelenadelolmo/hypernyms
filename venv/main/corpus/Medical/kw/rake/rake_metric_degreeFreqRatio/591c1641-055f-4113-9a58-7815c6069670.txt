Left neck bruit.
Surveillance for aneurysm formation.
Carotid ultrasound: Asymmetrically narrowed common carotid artery to the bulb.  At bifurcation, one vessel courses anteriorly and demonstrates branch vessels, a temporal tap, and high resistance wave form.  The second vessel courses posterior, is unusually narrow in caliber, and demonstrates a high resistance waveform.

MRA neck:  Right internal carotid artery is markedly narrowed.  Ectatic or hypertrophied left internal carotid. Asymmetry of the common carotid arteries.  The right MCA fills from the left carotid through and anterior communicating artery (not shown).

CT: Hypoplastic right bony petrous carotid canal.
Congenital Hypoplasia of the Internal Carotid Artery
Congenitally hypoplastic right internal carotid artery.
Acquired pathologies like arteriosclerosis, arteritis, fibromuscular dysplasia, intimal dissection, or Moya
Moya disease.
38 y.o. man with dizziness.  No trauma.
