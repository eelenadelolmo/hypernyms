Unless the radiograph is centered low enough, bladder herniations are often overlooked on excretory urography.  The radiologist should suspect herniation of the bladder when there is lateral displacement of the pelvic ureter or hydronephrosis (caused by traction on the trigone), an asymmetric and small bladder, and when the bladder base is not completely visible or is drawn to one side.  Supine and prone radiographs are successful in demonstrating only 30% and 50% of bladder herniations, respectively.  Only the erect view is uniformly successful in showing the abnormality.  The herniated bladder is clearly demonstrated on cystography, whereas the hernial opening may be overlooked on cystoscopy.

Inguinal or scrotal ultrasound on CT may show the bladder herniation, although the differential diagnosis for a scrotal fluid collection includes hydrocele, varicocele, spermatocele, epidydimal cyst, intestinal hernia, and ectopic ureterocele.
Inguinal herniation of the bladder
Given contrast opacification of the scrotal mass and visualization of the bladder herniating through the inguinal canal, no differential diagnosis is needed in this case.
63 year old male with right lower quadrant pain.
This case nicely demonstrates the clear herniation of the bladder through the inguinal canal and the clear contrast opacification of the bladder in the scrotum.  As the patient left the radiology department before the CT was interpreted, we were not able to inquire if had any of the classic two-stage voiding symptoms.  Although, given the large scrotal component of the bladder, those symptoms are likely.
