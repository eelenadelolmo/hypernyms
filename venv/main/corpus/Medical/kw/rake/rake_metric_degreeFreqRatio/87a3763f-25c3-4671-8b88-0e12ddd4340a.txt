Texto: 
Small palpable lump under the skin in the right axilla.
Silicone granuloma stemming from previous implant rupture; current implants intact.

If the granuloma is bothersome to the patient, it could be removed. However, no treatment is medically required at this time.
• Ultrasound evaluation was performed first, and demonstrated a "snow storm" appearance in the location of the palpable abnormality.
• MRI was performed next, using several sequences, including one that createas a bright signal from silicone. The MRI shows intact saline implants and a abnormality outside the implant corresponding in size and location to the clinical palpable abnormality.
Silicone Granuloma of the Breast
• Current saline implants intact
• Silicone granuloma
44 y.o. woman with a history of multiple breast implants, revisions,  and implant removals.  She presents now with a palpable lump in the right axilla and was referred for imaging of possible implant rupture.
This case emphasizes the importance of correlating clinical and imaging findings with surgical history.
