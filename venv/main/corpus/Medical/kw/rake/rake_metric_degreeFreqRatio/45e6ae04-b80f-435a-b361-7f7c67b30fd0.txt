BP 170/100 (improved to 150/80 with atenolol)

Weak femoral pulses

UA - Urine protein to creatinine ratio was 0.2 mg/mg.  Urine protein was 21 mg/dL and urine creatinine was 118 mg/dL. 

Normal ECG

He was subsequently referred to the Nephrology Clinic for evaluation and during this evaluation, he underwent an echocardiogram which showed:  

• Severe coarctation of the aorta with peak gradient ~68mmHg.
• Functionally bicuspid aortic valve with trace aortic insufficiency and absence of stenosis.
• Possible origin of the circumflex coronary artery from the right aortic sinus.
• Mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal systolic function.
• Qualitatively normal right ventricular size and systolic function.
• Mildly dilated aortic root and ascending aorta.

MRI was subsequently performed.
Repair of coarctation of the aorta with Dacron patch augmentation. Follow-up CT later showed the patient to be doing fine. A circumflex artery arises from the right sinus of valsalva, but this is found to be a benign anomaly. Bicuspid valve is better visualized via CT scan.

On day of discharge, patient's blood pressure was well controlled with systolic blood pressure range from 110 to 130 on PO meds.
There is a tight aortic coarctation with interruption of flow of the aorta, located 2.5 cm distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. There is extensive collateralization of intercostal, internal thoracic and thyrocervical trunk branches that fill the descending aorta. 

1. Tight aortic coarctation with interruption of flow.

2. Extensive collateralization supplying the descending aorta. 

3.  bicuspid aortic valve, which demonstrates no evidence of regurgitation or stenosis.

4. Abberant retroaortic circumflex coronary artery.
Coarctation of the Aorta
• Coarctation of the Aorta
• Tubular hypoplasia
• Aortic atresia
• True aortic interruption
The patient is a 13-year-old boy who was found on a school physical to have upper extremity hypertension.  Occasional history of syncope.

No smokers in the home and nutrition seemed adequate. No family history of heart disease was provided.
Although endovascular treatment with angioplasty and/or stent placement is feasible with likely good result, the surgical option has a long history of excellent long-term results in this setting and surgery was recommended.
