Bone Palliation Therapy- Sm-153-EDTMP
Tc99m- HDP Bone Scan: Too numerous to count focal areas of
radiotracer uptake throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton, consistent with the patient's history of metastaic prostate disease.  Particular note is made of uptake involving the proximal femora and lumbar spine, which are the primary sites of the patient's pain.

Samarium-153-EDTMP:  Indistinguishable from the above described bone scan
