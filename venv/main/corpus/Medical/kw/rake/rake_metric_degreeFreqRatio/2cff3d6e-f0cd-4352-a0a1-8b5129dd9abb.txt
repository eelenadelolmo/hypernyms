The patient was hydrated until her creatinine normalized.
Contrast retained within both kidneys.

There are many causes of persistent nephrograms. However, usually due to acute renal failure.  The following is a brief summary of the major catergories of acute renal disease.

Pre-renal
Hypotension
Dehydration
Decreased overall perfusion
