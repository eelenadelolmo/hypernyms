Follow up imaging in 6 months was recommended.
cystic, non-enhancing lesion in the tail of the pancreas.
Serous Cystadenoma of the Pancreas
serous cystadenoma (microcystic)
mucinous cystadenoma (macrocystic)
pseudocyst
intraductal papillary mucinous tumor (arising in a side branch)
patient noted to have a hypodense lesion in the tail of the pancreas on a non-contrast CT obtained for microhematuria.
The imaging appearance of a cluster of small cysts in the tail of the pancreas, as well as the patient's age and gender, favor the diagnosis of a serous cystadenoma (microcystic adenoma).  Small, cystic pancreatic lesions which are discovered incidentally may often be followed safely (AJR 2005; 184:20-23).
