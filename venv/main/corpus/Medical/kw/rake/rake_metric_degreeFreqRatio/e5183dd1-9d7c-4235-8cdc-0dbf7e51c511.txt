Physical exam was within normal limits.  No cervical adenopathy or anterior neck mass.

Esophageal-gastro-duodenoscopy revealed erythema to the lower esophageal sphincter and stomach fundus.  Findings consistent with gastro-esophageal reflux disease.  No lesions, erosions, or masses noted.
Patient to undergo surgical resection of the diverticulum.
1) Swallowing mechanism is satisfactory. There is no aspiration. 

2) There is a classical Zenkers diverticulum arising from the esophagus at the cervical dorsal junction. This extends somewhat to the left and measures approximately 3cm. in greatest diameter. It fills readily and empties somewhat slowly. Mild associated compression of the adjacent esophagus is readily demonstrated. 

3) The esophageal contours otherwise are satisfactory. A small sliding hernia was intermittently visualized. No spontaneous reflux was demonstrated and there was no reflux with a water siphon test.
Zenker's Diverticulum
1) Zenker's diverticulum- above upper esophageal sphincter

2) Traction diverticulum- near midpoint of esophagus

3) Epiphrenic diverticulum- above lower esophageal sphincter
62 year old male with 1 year history of progressive dysphagia and associated hoarseness.  Patient also reported transient episodes of rumination and gurgling sound from throat.
