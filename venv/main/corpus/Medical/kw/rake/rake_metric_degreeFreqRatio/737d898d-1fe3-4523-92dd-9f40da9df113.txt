Chest CT demonstrates right apical lung mass with multiple pulmonary nodules and enlarged subcarinal and paratracheal lymph nodes.
Aggressive chemotherapy and radiation therapy were continued, however the patient succumbed to his disease 4 weeks after the bone scan was performed.
A 99mTechnetium methylene diphosphonate bone scan demonstrates bilateral upper and lower extremity periosteal accumulation of bone tracer.
Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPO)
Metastatic vs. metabolic bone disease (e.g. Paget’s disease, thyroid acropachy, acromegaly, fibrous dysplasia).
This 65 y.o. man, with lung cancer (neuroendocrine carcinoma with small cell component) is on concurrent radiation and chemotherapy.
Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (Bamberger-Marie disease) is a clinical syndrome of clubbing of the fingers and toes, symmetric periostitis of the long bones of the upper and lower extremities and painful swollen joints. A small number of patients have primary osteoarthropathy so-called pachydermoperiostosis while the majority (> 95%)  have secondary osteoarthropathy as a result of pulmonary disease.
