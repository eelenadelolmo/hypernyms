The abdomen is soft and nondistended.  There are normal bowel sounds in all four quadrants of the abdomen.  Negative Murphy's sign.  No rebound tenderness or involuntary guarding.  There are no palpable masses.
Although it is acceptable to observe asymptomatic gallstones, symptomatic gallstones should be treated.  Oral dissolution can be considered if surgery (e.g., laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy) is not an option.  Percutaneous cholecystostomy can be considered in high risk patients.
Gray scale ultrasonographic images of the gallbladder demonstrate innumerable mobile subcentimeter foci of increased echogenicity nearly completely filling the gallbladder lumen with posterior acoustic shadowing.  The gallbladder wall has a normal appearance and measures 2 mm in thickness.  There is no pericholecystic fluid.  The common bile duct is not dilated and measures 2 mm in diameter.
