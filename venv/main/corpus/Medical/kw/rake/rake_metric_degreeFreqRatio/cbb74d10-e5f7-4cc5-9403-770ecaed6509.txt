Labs from infertility workup normal to date
Infertility workup continuing, patient referred for IVF evaluation.
HSG findings:
• Uterine cavity normal contour and size
• No evidence of persistent uterine filling defect
• No spillage of contrast into the peritoneum
• Bilateral clubbing of the distal fallopian tubes
Hydrosalpinx
Hydrosalpinx
31 year old G6P0 presents for infertility workup, first 5 pregnancies resulted in early SABs. Last pregnancy was right side ectopic 1.5 yrs ago, patient received D&C and exlap with right salpingectomy and removal of an incidentally discovered left ovarian endometrioma with left sided chronic salpingitis noted on path. No history STDs.  HSG performed prior to last pregnancy was normal.
This patient’s 10 year history of recurrent pregnancy loss and fertility problems led to performance of HSG.  Images taken early in the process of  contrast administration revealed normal uterine anatomy and filling, suggesting that defects of the uterine cavity, such as polyps, fibroids or synechiae were not currently contributing to her fertility problem.  Likewise, proximal fallopian tube anatomy appeared to be normal bilaterally, based on normal flow of contrast through the cornu into the distal tubules.

The finding of distal tubal clubbing and a lack of spillage of contrast from the distal tubal ends into the peritoneum suggests the presence of bilateral tubal blockage.  Given the patient’s previously normal HSG results, it is possible that bilateral tubal scarring developed following surgery, leading to impeded transport of oocytes and sperm.  

The presence of hydrosalpinges has been linked with decreased success rate of IVF, and this patient should be considered for surgical correction of these defects prior to fertility treatment.  Further, while this study suggests post-surgical obstruction as the cause of her current infertility problems, it does not reveal the cause of her extended history of early pregnancy loss, necessitating continuation of the fertility workup.
