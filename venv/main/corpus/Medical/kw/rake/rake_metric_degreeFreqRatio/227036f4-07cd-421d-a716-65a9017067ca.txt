By MRI - Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis, Rice bodies
Left knee pain for several months
SOC may be confused with pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) if only MRIs are available, and plain radiographs may help in such cases. On MRI, may appear as a lobulated intra-articular mass isointense to muscle on T1WI and hyperintense to muscle on T2WI containing multiple foci of low signal intensity. The distinguishing feature of SOC is calcification, which appears as signal voids in the synovium, best seen when the intra-articular fragments are calcified.
