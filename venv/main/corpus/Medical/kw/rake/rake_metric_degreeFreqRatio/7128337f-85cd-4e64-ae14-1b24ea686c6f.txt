Texto: 
Asymmetric right breast enlargement and firmness
-No erythema
-Thick, whitish nipple discharge
-Antibiotic treatment
-Aspiration  (if recurrent aspiration needed for re-accumulation, then a drainage catheter can be placed).
Mammogram:  Dense right breast parenchyma.  A large double density is present in the posterior third of breast.  No suspicious calcifications or secondary signs of malignancy.

US:  Diffuse breast parenchymal edema with a large hypoechoic mass in the posterior breast.  No internal color flow.
INFECTED GALACTOCELE
Galactocele (Infected or noninfected)
Abscess
31 year old with right breast firmness and enlargement with thick white nipple discharge.  

--Had been breast feeding since December and recently stopped with minimal improvement.  
--Unable to pump right breast during this period.
--Prior history of mastitis in right breast during lactation period, which was treated with oral antibiotics.
Given the patient history of mastitis, it is unclear whether the galactocele was present and got secondarily infected from the mastitis.  Or whether the breast edema from the mastitis created a functional obstruction leading to the formation of the galactocele.
