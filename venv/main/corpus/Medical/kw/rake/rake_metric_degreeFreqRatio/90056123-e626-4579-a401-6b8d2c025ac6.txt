The plain film shows severe osteopenia.  There is a subtle area of sclerosis noted at the superior posterior aspect of the calcaneus.
On the MRI, a T1 sagital image shows a nondisplaced fracture through the calcaneus.
Calcaneal fracture in the setting of disuse osteopenia.
Secondary osteoporosis

14 yo boy with left foot pain and swelling after a physical therapy session with a new therapist.
The patient presented with pain and swelling in the left foot after a physical therapy appointment with a new therapist.  The plain film demonstrated severe osteopenia, disuse osteopenia secondary to the patient’s cerebral palsy.  Due to the osteopenia, it was difficult to identify the fracture on plain film, so a further evaluation with an MRI was recommended to better evaluate the osseous structures and the soft tissues.  The MRI clearly demonstrates a  nondisplaced calcaneal fracture.
