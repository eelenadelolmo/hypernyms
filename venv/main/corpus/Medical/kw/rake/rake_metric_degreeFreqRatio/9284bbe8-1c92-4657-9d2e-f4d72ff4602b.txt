No findings of active SLE were noted on patient's initial presentation to the radiology department.  After having the patient ingest barium, she began experiencing chest pressure/pain.
"Laparoscopic treatment is successful and should be the method of choice. The diverticular neck can be exposed satisfactorily from the abdomen; a stapler inserted from this angle is better orientated to transect the neck than one inserted through a thoracoscopic approach."   ----

Single-column contrast upright frontal-oblique fluoroscopic image of the gastroesphageal junction shows a large sacular outcropping of the distal esophagus and multiple filling defects within.  More distally, a stricture of the gastroesophageal junction itself is noted.
Epiphrenic Diverticulum with retained food contents.
No differential for this lesion.
41 year-old African American female with history of systemic lupus erythematosus, now with increasing dysphagia for the past week and chest pain with ingestion of food.
This outpouching was directly related to the patient's underlying systemic disease.  Increased pressure from a stricture at the GE junction created this large outpouching.  The outpouching was a source of significant pain for the patient and the administration of barium contrast worsened the patient's symptoms.
