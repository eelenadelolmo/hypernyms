Supportive treatment.
Thickened, dysmorphic long bones and bowing of both tibias and femurs.  Absent sacral alae, narrow iliac bones, acetabular hypoplasia, and widely separated, short ischial bones.

Developmental, or physiologic, bowing represents exaggeration of normal age-related varus angulation at the knee joint.  Believed to be secondary to in utero molding, the growth plates are normal, and this condition usually corrects within 6 months of walking.  It is more common in obese and African-American children.  

Tibia vara, or Blount disease, is secondary to abnormal stress on the posteromedial proximal tibial physis, with resultant growth suppression and asymmetric growth at the epiphysis. It is believed to be an exaggerated form of the physiologic varus angulation (bowing).  As opposed to developmental bowing, the medial aspect of the tibial metaphysis is characteristically depressed, with an abrupt angulation and a beak-like prominence.  It is usually treated with braces, though surgery can be required.

In osteogenesis imperfecta, bowing of the long bones results from softening caused by abnormal collagen and multiple fractures. Bowing typically involves all the long bones, though fractures may not appear until later in infancy.  Deformities of the extremities, blue sclera, lax ligaments, and dental abnormalities may also be seen.

Achondroplasia is the most common short-limbed dwarfism.  Short, thick long bones with cupping and metaphyseal flaring is typical, as is lower extremity bowing.  The phalanges are short and cupped, the iliac bones are short and rectangular, and the pubic and ischial bones are short and wide.  As opposed to a normal spine, narrowing of lumbar interpedicular distances is frequently seen.
