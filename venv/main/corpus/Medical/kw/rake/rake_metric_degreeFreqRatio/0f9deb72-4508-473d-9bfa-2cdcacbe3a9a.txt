Texto: 
Violaceous non blanching papules and plaques, with minimal scale. Mild rhinitis and watering of eyes. No lymphadenopathy. Hip incision site well- healed without tenderness, erythema or discharge. 

LAB: Mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lipid panel within normal limits except for a mild increase of HDL and VLDL.
UPEP/SPEP within normal limits, complete skeletal survey without evidence of lytic bone lesions. Lymphocyte transformation assay shows no reactivity upon exposure to metals. Prednisone helps improve the pruritus with mild decrease in induration of the plaques, but no resolution of lesions.
S06-13374 A and B (right inner arm and left mid back). Xanthogranulomatous dermatitis.
