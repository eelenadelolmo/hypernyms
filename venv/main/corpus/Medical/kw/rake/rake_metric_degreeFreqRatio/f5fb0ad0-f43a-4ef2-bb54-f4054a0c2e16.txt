Path proven myxoid liposarcoma of the right thigh.
Patient is scheduled to undergo resection of this lesion.
Frontal and lateral views of the chest show a large, well-demarcated mass overlying the right hemothorax.  Given the smooth, distinct contours, a chest wall/pleural based process was favored.  This mass was eventually proven to be metastatic myxoid/round cell liposarcoma of the right anterior chest wall, identical to the histology of the primary thigh mass.

Selected axial noncontrast CT images of the chest show a large, well-demarcated pleural/chest wall based mass at the anterior aspect of the right hemithorax.  An anterior mediastinal component is also present.  This mass was eventually proven to be metastatic myxoid/round cell liposarcoma of the right anterior chest wall, identical to the histology of the primary thigh mass.
Myxoid/Round Cell Liposarcoma, Metastatic to Chest Wall
I.  Primary and metastatic sarcomas
    A.  Liposarcoma – well-differentiated, myxoid/round cell, dedifferentiated, and pleomorphic histopathologic subtypes
    B.  Other sarcomas arising from the pleural cavity (Okby et al.)
	Synovial sarcoma
	Malignant fibrous histiocytoma
	PNET/Ewing sarcoma
	Angiosarcoma
	Chondrosarcoma
	Osteosarcoma
	Leiomyosarcoma
II.  Other
     A.  Lymphoma
     B.  Metastatic carcinoma of extrathoracic primary
     C.  Malignant mesothelioma
The patient is a 51 year-old male with a history of right thigh myxoid/round cell liposarcoma.  A large pleural/chest wall mass was identified on a routine chest radiograph three months after VATS for resection of a 2.2cm x 2.2cm x 1.5cm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule.  The patient was asymptomatic.
