Pain control and immobilization.
An oblique fracture is present through the ulnar aspect of the third metacarpal which extends to the physis, consistent with a sprial Salter-Harris II fracture. There is minimal displacement of the fracture fragments, less than 2 mm at the midshaft. No other fractures are evident. Soft tissue structures are remarkable for
 extensive swelling on the dorsum of the hand.
