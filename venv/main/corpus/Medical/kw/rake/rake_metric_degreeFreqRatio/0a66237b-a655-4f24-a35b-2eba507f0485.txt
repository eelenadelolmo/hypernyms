Temp 99.0 HR 126 Resp 28 BP 96/60 Sat 90% on room air
Significant PE findings:
Lung: inspiratory stridor, clear rhinorrhea, no retractions/flaring, no use of acc. muscles
PE otherwise unremarkable
Pt initially seen and physician gave child dose of racemic epi and decadron, and sent child via ambulance to our hospital for admission to Peds Ward. Pt seemed to initially respond to treatment, but later that evening, symptoms returned. Repeat dose of racemic epi produced no relief of symptoms, so then imaging performed.

CXR revealed a coin lodged in esophagus, likely impinging slightly on trachea and causing breathing difficulties.

EGD retrieval under sedation was performed, and repeat films were shot to look for any evidence of soft tissue damage.

Pt was observed overnight and discharged to home the following day.

At f/U visit in clinic 3-4 days later, no return of symptoms, child otherwise well.
