Conservative management with follow up as indicated clinically.
Frontal and frog leg lateral radiographs of the hips demonstrate normal alignment and ossification.  There is no fracture and the joint spaces appear within normal limits.

Long axis sonographic images of the hips demonstrate a predominantly anechoic fluid collection at the left hip joint consistent with an effusion.  The right hip joint is within normal limits.

A single intra-operative fluoroscopic view of the left hip demonstrates placement of an aspiration needle within the left hip joint space.
