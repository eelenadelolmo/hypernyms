On physical exam there is no obvious deformity of right upper extremity and the shoulder girdles are symmetrical with normal contours.   Pain in right upper extremity, with palpation internal and external rotation, and with passive and active range of motion.  Special tests:  Negative sulcus sign, positive apprehension test.   No neurological deficits noted.
For a simple Hill-Sach’s lesion,  appropriate reduction should be done as soon as possible, followed by immobilization for approximately four to six weeks (although this remains controversial), and rehabilitation of shoulder to include increasing range of motion, increasing strength, and restoring neuromuscular control (if deficit present).  If a Hill-Sach’s lesion is coupled with a Bankart lesion, surgical intervention and repair may be required.  Surgical repair may be conducted via arthroscopy or in an open procedure, with advantages and disadvantages to each approach.  Some of the benefits of the arthroscopic approach are less morbidity such as less risk for injury to the axillary and musculocutaneous nerves and subcutaneous tissue, quicker recovery time, improved shoulder stability, and more effective response to physical therapy.  The disadvantages of arthroscopic surgery include higher failure rates (7-17% will redislocate).    The advantages of open surgery include less than 10% failure rate and more accurate repair.  Disadvantages of open repair are significant loss of external rotation (approximately 12%)  and abduction, extensive dissection and greater capsular scarring.
A-P radiograph of the right shoulder in internal rotation shows a grooved defect in the posterolateral humeral head.  Axial proton-density with fat saturation MR image shows an area of high signal intensity of the posterolateral humeral head and overlying cartilage consistent with a Hill-Sachs lesion. Proton-density and the T2-weighted with fat sat coronal oblique MR images show the Hill-Sach’s lesion of the humeral head with fractured cortex.  T2-weighted with fat sat sagittal oblique MR image shows the high signal intensity edema and subchondral cyst formation in humeral head beneath the Hill-Sach’s fracture.  There is no evidence of bony Bankart lesion on the plain radiographs or bony or cartilaginous Bankart lesion on the MR images.
Hill-Sach’s lesion with underlying subcortical bone contusion and subchondral cyst formation consistent with chronicity.
The findings are typical for Hill-Sach’s lesion.
42 yo man presents with onset of right shoulder pain for two years, combined with right upper extremity numbness and tingling.
A Hill-Sach’s lesion occurs when the humeral head is dislocated anterolaterally and impacts against the anterior glenoid bony labrum.  This lesion can be seen in approximately 30-40% of patients who have first-time anterior dislocations and approximately 80% of patients with repeat dislocations.   A Bankart lesion, which is defined as an avulsion of the anterior inferior glenoid labrum at its attachment to the inferior glenohumeral ligament complex, can accompany the Hill-Sach’s lesion. For patients with a Bankart lesion, 75% will also sustain a Hill Sach’s lesion.    The probability of a recurrence is related to the age of the patient at time of injury.  Recurrence of dislocations develops in 90% of patients under age 20 years, 60% of patients between 20 and 40 years, and 10% in patients over 40 years.   The type of sporting activity (i.e. contact versus individual) and the level of sport participation (i.e. recreational versus professional) is also related to recurrence.   For both lesions males are affected much more often than females, especially active adolescents and adults who are younger than age 25.    However, as young women become more involved with athletics, the incidence of dislocations may change.  Ethnicity of the patient is not a predisposing factor for dislocations.  Although plain radiographs should always be the first study done to evaluate patients with any shoulder pain, MR imaging is the procedure of choice to diagnose and define the extent of the lesion.  In fact, MR imaging resulted in a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 91%, and an accuracy of 94% in the detection of Hill-Sach’s lesions.    T2-weighted MR images will show high signal intensity at the site of impaction of the humeral head.  T2-weighted MR images may also show subcortical bone high signal intensity that represents an area of contusion or subchondral cyst formation when chronicity is present.
