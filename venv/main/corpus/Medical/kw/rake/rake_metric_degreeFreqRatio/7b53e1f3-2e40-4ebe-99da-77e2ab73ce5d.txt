Normal exam.
Catheter directed thrombolysis/thrombectomy was performed as well as systemic anticoagulation.
Hyperdense thrombus throughout dural sinuses and hyperdense material throughout sulci, sparing the basal cisterns and ventricles.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage from sinus thrombosis
• Subarachnoid hemorrhage from sinus thrombosis
• SAH from vs. aneurysm
• SAH from  trauma
• Dural sinus thrombophlebitis from infection
55 y.o. woman presented to the ED 4 days after minor head trauma with a progressively worsening headache.  She had no significant past medical history.
It was felt that the initial head trauma was so minimal that it was likely unrelated to the SAH.  The patient is undergoing extensive workup to determine the etiology of the dural sinus thrombosis.
