Elavated CA 19-9 = 185 (37 upper limits normal)
Whipple procedure +/- adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy
The images through the level of the liver and porta hepatis demonstrate extrahepatic and intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Images through the level of the pancreas demonstrate a 3cm mass in the head of the pancreas. Pelvic images demonstrate thrombi within the right common iliac and left common femoral vein.
Pancreatic Carcinoma
Pancreatic carcinoma
Mass due to chronic pancreatitis
Cholangiocarcinoma
Duodenal/ampullary carcinoma
Painless jaundice.
Classic CT imaging findings for pancreatic carcinoma are present in this case to include pancreatic head mass and extrahepatic and intrahepatic ductal dilatation. The finding of multiple DVTs is consistent with Trousseau's sign, a paraneoplastic migratory thrombophlebitis strongly associated with pancreatic and lung cancers.
