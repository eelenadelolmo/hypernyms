Casting with bone electrical stimulation device.
Markedly bowed right tibia, convex anterolateral, greatest in mid diaphysis with endosteal reaction and cortical thickening, medial greater than lateral in the shaft of the right tibia.  There is an oblique lucency through the area of greatest bowing consistent with a closed fracture.  The distal fragment is slightly displaced anteriorly.  The fracture line is subacute as there is sclerosis at the ends of both fragments.

Comparison AP and Lateral radiographs seven months prior revealed markedly bowed right tibia, convex anterolateral, greatest in mid diaphysis with endosteal reaction and cortical thickening, medial greater than lateral, in the shaft of the right tibia without evidence of fracture.
Neurofibromatosis associated pseudoarthrosis of the tibia
Neurofibromatosis, fibrous dysplasia, healed Rickets, osseous syphilis, developmental bowing deformity, Weissmann-Netter-Stuhl syndrome, Osteogenesis Imperfecta, congenital pseudoarthrosis, and any cause of pseudoarthrosis or nonunion of fracture such as inadequate immobilization of an occult fracture, gap between fracture fragments, loss of blood supply, or infection.
Three year-old female with neurofibromatosis and suspected right tibial fracture.
