Within the inferior pole of the left testicle is a well-circumscribed heterogeneous, predominantly hypoechoic mass with peripheral chunky calcifications. The mass measures 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm. No increase vascular flow is seen.
epidermoid cyst
Epidermoid, germ cell tumor, hematoma, abscess, and metastasis.
20 YO Midshipman with left cystic lesion inferior pole on exam.  No history of trauma.
The patient had a pathology proven epidermoid cyst.  Epidermoid cysts account for 1-2 % of resected testicular tumors.  They are benign and typically asymptomatic.    Organ preservation surgery has been suggested but because the findings of epidermoid cysts can vary, most surgeons still perform orchiectomy.  

Most are well demarcated round masses with echogenic or echolucent rims and variable internal echotexture.  Some will have calcifications.  More  specific findings include an  onionskin or target appearance of concentric rings of alternating hypoechogenicity and hyperechogenicity.    This finding correlates well with alternating layers of compacted keratin and loosely dispersed desquamated squamous cells.  Most epidermoid cysts will show a lack of internal flow unlike other tumors.  MRI should show a nonenhancing lesion.  T1/T2 signal may be heterogenous.
