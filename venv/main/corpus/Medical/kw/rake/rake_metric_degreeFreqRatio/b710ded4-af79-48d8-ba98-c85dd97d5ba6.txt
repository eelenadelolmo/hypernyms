Vitals stable-
head circumference has crossed two standard deviations since birth at last check up at 4 months of age.
At time of imaging- the sedation unit was notified as well as the on-call pediatrician to initiate work up for non-accidental trauma
CT-head: demonstrates bilateral extra axial subdural fluid collections with HU measurements greater than 20.  There is mass effect with displacement of the bilateral cerebral hemispheres caudally

MRI-brain:  Extra-axial fluid collections that demonstrate varying signal intensity on Flair and T1 weighted imaging suggestive of hemorrhagic collections of different ages. There is magnetic susceptibility artifact at the junction of the extra axial collection with the cortex on GRE imaging consistent with hemosiderin
Child abuse, subdural hematoma, retinal hemorrhage
Non-accidental trauma
Accidental trauma 
Bleeding diathesis
Birth injury
4 month old infant presents with increasing head circumference- rule out hydrocephalus
