Our patient was diagnosed with Stage 5 Wilms tumor as her disease was present bilaterally.  Prior to her several kidney surgeries the patient underwent several rounds of Chemotherapy including Actinomycin and Vincristine in hopes of shrinking the kidney and allowing for sparing of some of its function.  The patient then underwent L radical nephrectomy with R partial nephrectomy.  She is followed closely with Hematology and Oncology as well as Urology.  She will require recurrent ultrasounds and CT scans to monitor for recurrence of disease.  Regular follow up with her PCP is suggested for routine physical exams and evaluation of patients current symptoms.  abnormalities in either of these screening measures may indicate reoccurrence may indicate reoccurrence. Patient symptoms should be followed as well as these may indicate recurrence of disease.
1)CT OF CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST, 

The right kidney apparently has a single mass. It is measured at 5 x 5.7x 5.6 cm. The remainder of the right kidney appears to enhance and excrete normally. The right renal collecting system does not appear to be involved. The left kidney is much more difficult to evaluate. There are at least seven left renal masses. The largest mass on the left anterior and off the inferior pole. It measures 5.5 x 4.9 x 4.1 cm. This mass is the most heterogenous and may be more vascular than the remainder of the masses. A second mass is identified superior and about the same level anteriorly on the right kidney. This measures 3.3 x 3.0 x 2.4 cm. On the ultrasound I believe that the masses were multi- lobulated, but I believe they actually are separate masses. A second inferior pole mass measures 3.7 x 4.3 x 4.1 cm. Smaller masses are identified in the left kidney, more posteriorly, measuring approximately 12 x 12 mm, 11 x 16 mm and 21 x 18 mm. I see no evidence of free fluid in the PELVIS. There is no definite mesenteric adenopathy. The bladder
is unremarkable. I see no evidence of enlarged inguinal nodes. There is shotty inguinal adenopathy bilaterally.




2)ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The left kidney is outside two standard deviations of normal in size.  It measures 5.7 cm in longest dimension with 9 cm being upper limits of normal for this age.  Inferior to the spleen there is a solid appearing mass which appears to adjoin the left kidney. This mass is echogenic in nature and multi-lobulated. It measures 8.4 x 4.3 x 7.1 cm. Inferior to the mass there is relatively normal appearing left kidney. The measurements stated for the left kidney include only the normal portion of the kidney.  Images of the right kidney also demonstrate a solid appearing mass off the superior pole. The right kidney measures 7.4 cm in longest dimension without the addition of the mass. The mass measures 5.5 x 3.1 x 4.8 cm. It again is echogenic and solid in appearance suggesting a solid renal tumor. The inferior portion of the right kidney is more normal in appearance, without evidence of hydronephrosis, echogenic focus to suggest a stone, or perinephric fluid collections.

Pt is a 3 y.o female who presented to PCP with distended abdomen and mild constipation x 2-3 weeks.  Denies nausea, vomiting, fever, chills.  The patient denies weight loss, night sweats, and hematuria.  No significant PMH.  The patient was then sent for Ultrasound, which showed bilateral enlargement of the kidneys with solid masses in both, confirmed by CT. She was referred to urology for further evaluation.
Path Report:
A. Specimen: L Radical Nephrectomy:
Microscopic Examination:
Tumor cells in the yellow area resemble those of the previous renal biopsy. A triphasic tumor with a prominent blastemal component is present.  In the adjacent grey-white to brown areas, the tumor shows more prominent epithelial components with prominent pleomorphism.  The Stromal component in both areas is much less prominent compared to the previous partial right nephrectomy.  Multifocal perilobar nephrogenic rests are present adjacent to the tumor and elsewhere in the upper pole.  The largest upper pole lesion shows additional papillary change.  A microscopic foci of tumor is present on the surface of this lesion and is interpreted as contamination.  No extra capsular tumor is appreciable in the lower pole lesions.  Intracapsular metastatic tumor is seen fairly frequently in the tumor blocks and 3 of 10 lymph nodes sections form the hilar region.  Focal subcapsular metastatic tumor is also present in these affected lymph nodes.  The hilar vascular and ureteral surgical margins show no appreciable tumor.  
Final Diagnosis: 
1.Wilms tumor S/P Chemotherapy
2.Nephroblastomatosis s/p Chemotherapy
3.Intracapsular metastatic tumor, kidney
4.Intracapsular and sub-capsular metastatic tumor, hilar lymph nodes.

B. Specimen: R partial nephrectomy
Microscopic Evaluation
Permanent sections show renal tissue, a thick fibrous capsule and adjacent nephroblastoma with blastemal areas and extensive tubular areas.  Abundant lymphocytic infiltrate is observed in this area.  Inked margins show capsular surface free of neoplasm. Medial edge of kidney section shows tubular nephroblastoma infiltrating margins of excision focally.
Final Diagnosis:
1)	Wilms Tumor with favorable histology
2)	Renal medial edge with focal nephroblastoma at margin of excision
Final Diagnosis: Bilateral Wilms Tumors with areas of nephroblastomatosis
