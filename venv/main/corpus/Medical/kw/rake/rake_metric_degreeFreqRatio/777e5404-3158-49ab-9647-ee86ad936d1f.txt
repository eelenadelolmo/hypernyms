This patient was immediately taken to the Labor/Delivery unit where examination revealed mild dilation of the external os and palpable membranes. Immediate placement of cervical cerclage was then done.
Sagittal views of lower uterine segment shows the fetus in a cephalic presentation. The placenta is posterior and well away from the internal cervical os.  The internal os however is widely open. There is also tunneling and funneling of the endocervical canal. 

The cervical plug was found to only be approximately 1 cm in length.
