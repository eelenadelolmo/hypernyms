Texto: 
The patient’s right wrist was swollen, red and painful.  No cutaneous injury was visible.  Blood cultures were negative, and the patient remained without an elevated white count or fever.  His sedimentation rate was mildly elevated at 27 (normal: 0-20).
The patient was started on IV Gentamicin and Vancomycin.
Plains films of the right wrist demonstrate a permeative lytic lesion involving the metadiaphysis of the right distal ulna.  There is disruption of the lateral cortex and periosteal reaction of the medial aspect of the ulnar metadiaphysis.  Swelling of the surrounding soft tissues is present without soft tissue calcifications identified.  The radius, carpal bones and metacarpal bone are unremarkable.  No pathologic fracture is seen.

12-year old boy presented to the emergency room complaining of right wrist pain for several weeks.  He had been hit with a hockey stick in the wrist approximately three weeks prior to presentation.  He initially presented to an outside hospital at the time of injury. At that time, plain films of his forearm and wrist were read as negative.
Osteomyelitis is an infection of bone, and it develops by three major routes: (1) hematogenous spread, (2) contiguous spread from an adjacent infection, and (3) direct implantation from a penetrating wound.  The most common route of infection in children is from hematogenous spread, and the most common organism of infection is Staphylococcus aureus.   Today, Salmonella osteomyelitis is rare, and is associated with sickle cell anemia.  Plain films are often normal early in the course of the infection as it may take 7-14 days from the start of the infection until plain radiographic findings develop.  The earliest finding may be nonspecific soft tissue swelling followed by bone destruction and periostitis.  In children, the open growth plate results in separate vascular supplies for the metaphysis and the epiphysis.  As a result, there is a tendency for hematogenously spread osteomyelitis to involve the metaphysis in children.  Subacute and chronic changes of osteomyelitis include sequestrations, involucrums, sinus tracts and Brodies abscesses.  

Imaging modalities important in helping make an early diagnosis of osteomyelitis include bone scan and MRI.  On MRI, acute osteomyelitis is associated with high signal intensity on T2W sequences as a result of the bone marrow edema.  In addition, cortical disruption and adjacent soft tissue swelling can be seen.  Technetium 99m bone scans will be positive within hours to days after the onset of infection, and will be three-phase hot.

Differential diagnosis for the radiologic findings of osteomyelitis include osteogenic sarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, lymphoma and eosinophilic granuloma.  The diagnosis can be made by biopsy of the site.  Therapy for osteomyelitis often involves 4-6 weeks of IV antibiotics.
