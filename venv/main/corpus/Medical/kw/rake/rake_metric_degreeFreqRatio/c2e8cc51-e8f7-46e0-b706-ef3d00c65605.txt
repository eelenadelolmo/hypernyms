The MR images demonstrate a lobulated, multiloculated sepatated mass within Hoffa’s fat adjacent to the undersurface of the patellar tendon.  The lesion demonstrates bright  fluid signal intensity on long Tr images.  Post-gadolinum images demonstrate thin peripheral enhancement and septal enhancement with no evidence of central/solid enhancement.  This suggests that the mass is cystic in composition.

A ganglion cyst is an idiopathic, benign mucinous soft tissue mass occurring in predictable locations.  They usually present clinically as localized swelling on or around joints, and near tendons of the hand or foot. The size of the cyst can vary over time. A ganglion is most frequently found around the wrist and in the fingers.  In the knee, a ganglion is typically para-articular in location or seen about the proximal tibiofibular joint.  Ganglion cysts arising from a joint may be connected to the joint via a “check valve” system, allowing fluid out of the joint, but not necessarily back in. 
     Ganglion cysts are often difficult to visualize on radiographs, but occasionally a soft tissue density creating a contor abnormality is present.  Doppler ultrasound can be utilized to assess vascularity as well as to assure cystic characteristics of the lesion (ie. exclude a pseudoaneurysm).  
     MRI is the imaging modality of choice to characterize a ganglion cyst.  T1w images typically demonstrate a hypointense to intermediate signal intensity mass. T2w images typically demonstrate a uniformly hyperintense soft tissue cystic mass.  On occasion, a narrow stalk is noted connecting the cyst to the joint space.   Multiple septations may be seen in the mass.  Post contrast MR images should be obtained to confirm benign peripheral and septal enhancement without central solid enhancement.  Solid enhancement would suggest other pathologic entities such as nerve sheath tumor.
     Also referred to as “Bible Bumps”, ganglion cysts were once treated by striking the lump with a large, heavy book, causing the cyst to rupture and drain into the surrounding tissues.  Historically, a Bible was used, as it was commonly found in many homes.  Unfortunately, the reccurrence rate was high with this type of treatment, and is not recommended (certainly not by the church).  
     Aspiration or excision of the cyst is the preferred method of initial management.  Clear synovial fluid is aspirated from the cyst, reducing its size and providing temporary relief in symptoms.  However, cysts generally reccur at a rate up to 50%.  Surgical excision is the definitive treatment in patients with reccurrence and persisting symptoms.  When the "check valve" at the joint capsule is completely removed, and the reoccurrence rate drops to 5%.
