Birth weight - 3390 g; T – 36.9; P – 123-153; RR – variable, on oscillator; BP – (63-90)/(34-57)
General: sedated, pt in no acute distress
HEENT: AFSF; symmetric face and mouth; normally shaped and located ears; 
Lungs: Small chest with bell shaped thorax and foreshortened ribs; BS clear in generally all fields, symmetric; no wheezes/rales/rhonchi
Abd: anasarca in neonatal period
Extremities: no evidence of rash; proximal arms shorter than distal arms

LABS - No abnormalities
Long narrow chest and relatively short ribs (Image 1)
Anterior aspects of the ribs are bulbous and irregular (Image 1)
Clavicles have a handlebar configuration (Image 1)

Pelvis is small with short flared iliac bones (Image 2)
Capital femoral ossification centers not present (Image 2)
Long bones appear relatively shortened (Image 2)

Exaggerated lumbar lordosis noted (Image 3)
Jeune Syndrome (Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy)
1.	Jeune syndrome
2.	Ellis van Crevald syndrome
3.	Achondroplasia/hypochondroplasia
4.	Thoracolaryngopelvic dysplasia (Barnes syndrome)
5.	Short rib polydactyly syndrome (types I-III)
Term newborn male noted to have poor respiratory effort and difficulty maintaining oxygen saturations despite intubation. Pt had the prenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia including short limbs and a small thorax; pt’s birth weight was 3350g, and Apgar scores were 3, 6, and 8 at one, five, and ten minutes.
In light of pt’s difficulty breathing occurring as a result of his pulmonary hypoplasia (small thorax being the main culprit in Jeune syndrome), the first and foremost intervention came in the form of a high-frequency oscillating ventilator. After about 4 weeks, pt was transferred to a conventional mechanical ventilator. At about 7 weeks, pt was extubated and slowly weaned to 4L HFNC. Thereafter, pt was briefly re-intubated for respiratory failure associated with increased secretions from Klebsiella infection. Apart from respiratory troubles, pt was also noted to be retaining fluid in his first two weeks of life, thus affecting another important organ system in Jeune syndrome, i.e. renal system. Pt was started on Aldactone and Diuril. Despite being on diuretics, pt’s blood pressure was found to be elevated, and at about 7 weeks, Norvasc and clonidine were added to the growing medication list. Pt’s multiple renal ultrasounds suggested normal renal size and parenchyma. Lastly, it is also vital to mention pt’s numerous bouts with infections, a common finding in patients with Jeune syndrome. Pt was started on nebulized tobramycin on DOL 15 after a leukins culture grew MSSA. Thereafter, on DOL 59, after requiring re-intubation with increased sputum production, pt’s leukin culture grew Klebsiella pneumonia, blood culture was negative, and urine culture grew Enterococcus. Pt was started on gentamicin, claforan, and ampicillin. After these microbes cleared up from the system, a subsequent leukins culture grew Pseudomonas for which tobramycin was re-started. Given pt’s history an early UTI, a VCUG study was done which showed up as normal.
