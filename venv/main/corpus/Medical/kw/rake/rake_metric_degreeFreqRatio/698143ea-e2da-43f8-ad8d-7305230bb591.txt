UA:  negative
-Urethroplasty or surgical treatment
-Beaded irregular appearance of the bulbous portion of the anterior urethra indicates the presence of multiple serial strictures.
Urethral stricture
1) Post Infectious urethral stricture:  This is highest in the differential given prior history of STD and imaging appearance.

2) Iatrogenic or post traumatic:  No such prior history.
32 y/o male with decreased urinary stream

PMH:  Prior history of STD as a young adult
INFECTION:  Venereal infection with Neisseria begins in the mucosal and periurethral Littre glands.  (can spread to posterior urethra, seminal vesicles, or epididymis).  Nongonococcal urethritis (Chlamydia and Ureaplasma)

*It is estimated that infection is cause of stricture in 40% (North America).  Proximal bulbous urethra is the site of stricture in 70% (higher concentration of periurethral glands and dependent position).  

*Infectious strictures can be multiple and short and serial or long.  Can see Littre gland opacification (backfilling)

IATROGENIC:  most commonly at anatomically fixed and narrow sites (ie:  membranous urethra and penoscrotal junction).  No characteristic findings:  focal and short, multifocal or long.

TRAUMA:  usually after complete transection  (vice partial laceration, which often heals without significant narrowing).  Usually solitary, < 2cm long and flanked by segments of urethra of normal caliber.
