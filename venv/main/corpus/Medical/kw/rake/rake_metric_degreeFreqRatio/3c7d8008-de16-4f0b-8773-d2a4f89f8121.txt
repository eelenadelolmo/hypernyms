ERCP Mar 1999: There is a calcified structure in the right upper quadrant overlying the liver.

RUQ US MAr 2001: Echogenic structure in the region of the gallbladder with posterior acoustic shadowing.

 CT Abd dated Oct 2002: Large calcified gallstone in the gallbladder causing mass effect on the gastric antrum/duodenum. Also note thickening of what appears to represent the gastric body or fundus.  Normal for age are some scattered arterial vascular calcifications.

AP abd film dated Dec 2002: Dilated loops of small bowel and paucity of gas in the Colon.

CT Abd dated Dec 2002: The gallstone has "disapeared" from the right upper quadrant/gallbladder fossa. In the terminal ileum there is a calcified structure with the same size and configuration of the gallstone that was described in the gallbladder on the Oct 2002 study

NOTE: There is an "incidental" finding of an "apple core" lesion located in the splenic flexure of the colon, consistent with a colon carcinoma and corresponding to the findings noted on the Oct 2002 abdominal CT.
Gallstone Ileus, Colon carcinoma (incidental)
For mechanical bowel obstruction:
<li> Adhesions.
<li> Small or large bowel masses.
<li> Extrinsic compression.
<li> Gallstone ileus.
<li> Foreign bodies
81 y.o. man with chronic mid-epigastric pain. Upper GI endoscopy  demonstrated a "possible proximal duodenal submucosal or extrinsic mass" and a CT scan of the abdomen was ordered.
This case highlights the progressive changes possible with chronic cholelithiasis and cholecystitis.  The large gallstone eventually eroded through the gallbladder and into the duodenum.  The stone then traveled through the small bowel, until it impacted in the terminal ileum near the ileocecal valve (junction with the cecum and ascending colon).  The bowel wall thickening - which was originally interpreted in CT as stomach - was shown to be distal transverse colon cancer.
