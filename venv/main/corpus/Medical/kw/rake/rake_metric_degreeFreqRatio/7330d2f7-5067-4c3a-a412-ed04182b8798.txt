No hard muscle mass or “olive” was appreciated on physical exam of the abdomen..
Surgical referral with incision of the hypertrophied muscle. The mucosa is left intact.  The procedure can be done via abdominal incision or laparoscopy.
The pylorus demonstrated abnormal increased wall thickness with a maximum thickness of 3.5 mm in the transverse plane.  The length of the pyloric channel was increased and measured approximately 16.7 mm.  On real time imaging, very little fluid was seen passing through the pyloric channel.
Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis
Gastroesophageal reflux
Pylorospasm
Hiatal Hernia
Preampullary duodenal stenosis
Malrotation (typically present with bilious vomiting)
Duodenal atresia
A 4 week old male presented complaining of a one week history of non-bilious vomiting.
The incidence of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is approximately 2-5 per 1,000 births.  It is more common in white individuals which was consistent with the race of the patient in this case.  Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is less common in India and among black and Asian populations with a frequency that is one third to one fifth that in white populations.
The patient in this case presented with nonbilious emesis; however, the classic “olive” or hard muscle mass on abdominal exam was not appreciated.  Studies have shown that abdominal palpation performed by experienced hands can successfully lead to the correct diagnosis in 85% to 100% of infants.  Increased reliance on imaging techniques has led to a decline in this rate.  A study in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s found that only 49% of cases could be diagnosed on clinical exam alone.  

An UGI study was not performed in this case; however, it is another method to diagnosis this problem.  Fluoroscopic observations include vigorous active peristalsis that comes to an abrupt halt at the pyloric antrum.  The thickened muscle causes an extrinsic impression which is termed the shoulder sign.  Eventually, peristalsis propels contrast through the pyloric channel with the appearance of a string sign or a double-track sign.  In a normal study, the prepyloric antrum widely distends between normal peristaltic waves.

An ultrasound examination of the upper abdomen was performed using a linear transducer operating between 8 and 15 MHz.  The sonographic exam in this case demonstrated a thickened pyloric channel of 3.5 mm.  Within the literature, the upper limit of normal muscle thickness ranges between 3.0 and 4.5 mm.  The hypertrophied canal in this case measured 16.7 mm. Reports in the literature for a normal pyloric channel in the longitudinal plane vary from 14 mm to 20 mm.  For many radiologists, the actual numeric measurements are less important than the overall morphology of the canal during real time observations.  The diagnosis for this case was confirmed by the demonstration of gastric peristaltic activity failing to distend the preduodenal portion of the stomach at the pylorus.  The thickness of the pyloric channel remained greater than 3 mm throughout the exam, and it was filled with redundant mucosa.  

The pylorus for this patient was not difficult to visualize; however, if difficulty is encountered, it is most often due to gastric over distention causing the displacement of the pylorus dorsally.  This problem can be overcome by orienting the patient toward the left in the supine position.  This position causes the pylorus to rise anteriorly which enables better sonographic examination.
Patients in which the pylorus does not relax during the exam and measures 2-3 mm in the transverse plane should be carefully monitored, and a follow up exam should be performed to rule out hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.
