There is a mass at the dome of the liver that is hypoattenuating on the precontrast images.  This mass demonstrates nodular peripheral enhancement with centripetal fill-in of the lesion with contrast over time and persistence on delayed images.  The enhancement of the lesion follows the aortic enhancement (blood pool) on all phases.
