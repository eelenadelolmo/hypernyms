No coagulopathy or elevation of sedimentation rate

Ataxia resolved on day 9
Anticoagulation
• Day 1  Left thalamic infarct by CT and MRI
• Day 3  Develops right cerebellar infarct
       CTA and MRA reveal small right vertebral artery
       without convincing evidence of dissection
• Day 6 Cerebral Angiogram demonstrates dissection of right vertebral artery with reconstitution by long cervical branches.  Right AICA is also occluded just past origin
Vertebral Artery Dissection with Cerebellar Infarction
• Arteritis
• Cerebritis
• Aminoacidopathy
• Sickle Cell Disease
• Vascular anomaly
• Vertebral artery dissection
• Cervical spine trauma
2 year old boy presents with lethargy, ataxia, and vomiting.

Father stated that symptoms began shortly after having child perform various gymnastic type exercises at home.
Both CTA and MRA showed small right vertebral artery without definite changes diagnositic of dissection.
Signal drop out on the MRA at the level of the high right vertebral artery was initially attributed to turbulent flow rather than occlusion with collateral reconstitution of the artery.
Catheter angiography was required for definitive diagnosis
