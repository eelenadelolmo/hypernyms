Patient was treated initially with ultrasound-guided compression of the pseudoaneurysm neck, which was not successful.  Ultrasound guided percutaneous injection of Thrombin was then performed with successful thrombosis.
Gray scale sonography:  1.6x1.6 cm anechoic mass with no visible wall located anterior to the superficial femoral artery.  There are internal echoes present.
Color Doppler:  Internal bidirectional flow which gives the classic “yin-yang” appearance.  There is a small lobulation projecting laterally which demonstrated flow.  There is also a visible neck which connects the mass to the superior femoral artery which demonstrates normal flow pattern.
Post-catheterization pseudoaneurysm
Pseudoaneurysm
Arteriovenous fistula
Hematoma
76 y/o male with right groin swelling, ecchymosis, and audible bruit following routine cardiac catheterization.
