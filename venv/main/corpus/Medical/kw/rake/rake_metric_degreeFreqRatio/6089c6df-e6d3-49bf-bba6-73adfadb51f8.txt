Lungs CTA bilaterally on exam

Chem panel was significant for elevated LFTs
Steroid therapy
Ultrasound image demonstrates a heterogenous appearance of the liver.  There is a question of diffuse low echotexture to the liver (a "starry sky" appearance) which may suggest edema.  It is difficult to exclude confluent hypoechoic nodules.

CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis demonstrates bilateral mediastinal adenopathy and innumerable small hypoattenuating nodules throughout the liver and spleen.
