Exam consistent with rotator cuff tear by orthopedist report.
Arthroscopic debridement resulted in symptom improvement.
Axial proton density images reveal a nondisplaced antero-inferior labral tear, with associated absence of the articular cartilage in this region.  The labrum remains attached to the anterior scapular periosteum.   T2 images (not shown) reveal no evidence of edema in this region.
