GEN: Child presents holding her arm in flexion and pronation.
RIGHT UE: Wrist/forearm: Nontender. No soft tissue swelling. Full ROM. Elbow: Swollen elbow circumferentially. Limited ROM. Shoulder: Nontender. No soft tissue swelling. Full ROM.
- Reduction of radial head subluxation via supination and extension.  Reimaging scheduled for 14 days.
1) LATERAL ELBOW:
- Displaced radial head epiphysis
- Anterior and Posterior fat pad signs are positive.
- Anterior Humeral Line: normal alignment

2) AP VIEW:
- Baumann's angle: decreased. abnl valgus carrying angle.
- Abnormal inferolateral slipped position of the radial head ossification center.
Salter-Harris injury of proximal radius
Salter-Harris injury of proximal radius, at least Type 1 but likely Type 2 (as this is more common).
4 year old female fell off a bunk bed. Rule out fracture.
