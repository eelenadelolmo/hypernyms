Back extension limited to 15 degrees due to lower back pain.

Unsteady during toe walk and heel walk.  

Perception of light touch intact bilaterally throughout lower extremities.  Perception of pin prick decreased along lateral aspect of right foot, intact on remainder of right foot and left foot.

Tenderness to palpation and percussion in lower back.  

Positive straight leg raise on right at 65 degrees, lower back pain radiating to right extremity above the knee.  Negative straight leg raise on left.

Right lower extremity strength: 4/5 dorsiflexion of foot, 4/5 extensor hallucis longus, 4/5 flexor hallucis longus, 4/5 plantar flexion of foot, 5/5 extension knee, 5/5 flexion knee.

Left lower extremity strength: 5/5 dorsiflexion of foot, 5/5 extensor hallucis longus, 5/5 flexor hallucis longus, 5/5 plantar flexion of foot, 5/5 extension knee, 5/5 flexion knee

Reflexes: 1+ Achilles tendon bilateral, 1+ patellar bilateral.

Electromyography: electrophysiological evidence of chronic right S1 radiculopathy based on the presence of large amplitude, long duration polyphasic motor units isolated in the right gastrocnemius medius and right peroneus longus muscles on monopolar needle examination.
Clinical diagnosis via patient history and physical exam findings: acute event followed by chronic back pain with radiculopathy.  This was confirmed by MRI which showed disc herniations at levels L4-L5 and L5-S1.

Beginning in 1994, the patient has pursued various treatment modalities.  Physical therapy exacerbated the pain.  Medrol Dose Pak (oral glucocorticoid), Naprosyn (naproxen), muscle relaxants, and Tylenol (acetaminophen) did not relieve the pain.  Surgery was suggested, but patient was reluctant to undergo an invasive procedure.

Chiropractic treatment was begun September 2009 and continued through the time of submission of this case.
MRI from last exacerbation:

L4-L5 disc level:   Disc desiccation.  Broad-based posterior disc herniation of the protrusion type moderately indenting the ventral thecal sac with borderline narrowing of central spinal canal.  Posterolateral bulges mildly encroach on and narrow the neural foramina with mild effacement of exiting nerve roots.   Mild facet arthropathy. Hypertrophic changes of ligamentum flavum.  

L5-S1 disc level: Disc desiccation.  Mild disc space narrowing.  Very large posterior disc herniation of the extrusion type with inferior extension extending to the lower third of S1 ventral body with severe impingement on the ventral thecal sac and on the transversing S1 nerve roots bilaterally.  Disc herniation measures 12.70mm horizontally and 19.35mm vertically.  Posterolateral ridging and bulges encroach on and mildly narrowing both neural foramena.

Lumbar lordosis: Straightening, probably due to muscle spasm.

MRI from 14 months later:

L4-L5 disc level:  Same as above

L5-S1 disc level: Marked improvement in posterior disc herniation compared to previous scan.  Inferior extension of the disc is markedly reduced. Disc herniation measures 7.97mm horizontally and 12.25mm vertically.

Lumbar lordosis: Same as above

A 43 y.o. man with no chronic adult illnesses presents with a chief complaint of lower back pain.  The lower back pain is midline and radiates down the right lower extremity to the foot.  The patient experiences weakness in his right foot and leg, noting that his right foot does not lift properly as he walks.  He also reports episodic tingling and numbness in his right leg extending to the 3rd to 5th toes of the right foot.  

The pain is an acute exacerbation of chronic pain traced back to a work-related injury from many years ago.   He remembers bending over lifting a box of paint - reported to weight approximately 100 lbs. and he heard a “pop” and immediately felt pain.  The pain had become stable and relatively quiescent, but then became acutely exacerbated about a year ago.

Symptoms have limited the patient to performing only mildly strenuous activities.  The pain is worse with activity, prolonged sitting or standing, repetitive twisting, bending, and lifting.  The pain is relieved with rest, ice, and change of position.  At rest, the pain is 6/10 and constant, sometimes throbbing.  With activity or strain, the pain is 9/10 and sharp. The patient denies changes in bowel movements or urinary continence.  

Since the event, the patient has pursued various treatment modalities.  Physical therapy exacerbated the pain.  Medrol Dose Pak (oral glucocorticoid), Naprosyn (naproxen), muscle relaxants, and Tylenol (acetaminophen) did not relieve the pain.  Chiropractic treatment  relieves the pain.

Patient has L4-L5 disc herniation with associated radiculopathy of the right L5 nerve root.  The disc herniation is of the protrusion type as seen on MRI.  The L5 radiculopathy is evidenced by the history of tingling and numbness of the medial toes, the weakness on heel walk, and the decreased strength of the right foot dorsiflexion and right great toe extension. 

Patient has L5-S1 disc herniation with associated radiculopathy of the right S1 nerve root.  The disc herniation is of the extrusion type as seen on MRI.  The S1 radiculopathy is evidenced  by the history of tingling and numbness in the lateral toes, the EMG results, the decreased pinprick sensation on the lateral right foot, the weakness on toe walk, and the decreased strength of right foot plantar flexion and right great toe flexion.

The patient’s pain and symptoms were refractory to treatment with Medrol Dose Pak (oral glucocorticoid), Naprosyn (naproxen), muscle relaxants, Tylenol (acetaminophen), and physical therapy.  

At the time of the last exacerbation, MRI scan was done (see results in “Summary of Imaging Findings”) and spinal manipulation was initiated as sole long-term therapy.  The technique is a modified chiropractic maneuver, designed specifically to relieve compressive effects of the disc herniation.  The patient is positioned prone on a flexion distraction table.  The patient grasps a handle located cephalad while the patient’s ankles are strapped at the opposite end.  The table is locked into a slightly flexed position and the bottom part of the table is distracted strongly, creating longitudinal tension on the spine.  The doctor makes a contact at the spinal segment superior to the disc herniation and delivers a powerful caudad to cephalad thrust using the doctor’s full body weight.  This decompresses the spine as the superior vertebra distracts relative to the subjacent segment.

With use of this modified chiropractic technique between September 2009 and August 2011, the patient’s symptoms and physical exam findings improved.  Per patient, the pain and tingling that had originally radiated to his toes became limited to radiating mid-thigh, and the strength in his right foot improved, though it remained weaker than his left foot.  

During the course of treatment between September 2009 and November 2010, MRI showed striking structural improvements corresponding with the symptomatic improvements.  Comparison of the two imaging studies reveals marked decreased extent of disc herniation at the L5-S1 level.  Horizontal disc herniation dimensions decreased from 12.70mm to 7.97mm, a 37.2% decrease.  Vertical disc herniation dimensions decreased from 19.35mm to 12.25mm, a 36.7% decrease.  There is decreased nerve impingement.  

The diagnosis of disc herniation was established in 1994 via the clinical presentation.  It would be ideal to have a baseline MRI from the original injury in 1994 to establish whether the disc herniations as of September 2009 had been stable since the event in 1994, or if new structural changes coincided with the acute exacerbation of symptoms in 2009.  Had the disc herniations been stable since 1994, evidence would be stronger for the direct positive effect of spinal manipulation therapy on spinal structure.  

These results suggest that spinal manipulation therapy had a positive impact on the clinical outcome of this patient.  Symptoms, physical findings, and MRI findings improved within 2 years of treatment.  The patient also experiences short-term pain relief with treatments.  The patient remains functionally impaired as he remains unable to work due to continued chronic back pain and weakness.  However, he states his quality of life has improved with the partial relief of pain. It is difficult to establish a causal link between the improvements and the spinal manipulation therapy because the patient presented with an acute exacerbation and acute back pain often spontaneously improves.  Yet the exacerbation was superimposed on chronic pain of 15 years.  

Although this patient had varying success with different treatment modalities, other more invasive treatments remain options.  This patient is a potential candidate for surgery because he has persistent disabling radiculopathy associated with a disc herniation.  Possible surgical measures include discectomy, microdiscectomy, disc replacement, and/or spinal fusion. Epidural glucocorticoid injections could be used to decrease local inflammation.

Chronic back pain and radiculopathy due to disc herniation is difficult to manage and there is conflicting literature on the effectiveness of treatments.  An individualized approach is essential.  For this patient, multiple recommended first-line therapies failed to improve symptoms.  Spinal manipulation therapy with a chiropractor provided short-term relief of pain and potentially long-term improvement of symptoms and MRI findings.  With proper medical guidance and knowledge of benefits and risks, this patient, like all patients, should decide the best approach to treatment.
