Vitals in normal range.
Extubated. 
Extensive subcutaneous emphysema.
No dyspnea.
The patient was brought to the OR and under local anesthesia a  28FR chest tube was inserted in the left pleural space. The OR and the surgical team were prepared for an emergency thoracotomy if necessary. Bronchoscopy was available  (rigid and flexible).  The "pig-tail" was withdrawn without complications. The subcutaneous emphysema disappeared almost completely in 5 days. The patient was discharged with no other complications.

Subcutaneous emphysema from pulmonary-parietal fistula from misplaced catheter
Subcutaneous emphysema in postoperative time can be related to:
1- tracheobronchial injury during intubation,
2- baro-trauma during mechanical ventilation,
3- mal positioning of the chest tube
A 72 year-old man,  five days post a C.A.B.G. developed a symptomatic pneumothorax during mechanical ventilation.  A 14FR "pig-tail" catheter was inserted in the left pleural space by the cardiologist.  Immediately after this, the patient developed subcutaneous emphysema.
Subcutaneous emphysema can be spontaneous or traumatic, but can be also associated with avoidable causes such as inadequate chest tube drainage, intrapulmonary placement of chest tube  (poor tube placement), problems in anchorage and blockage, and also with side-port migration into the subcutaneous tissue. It is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality, and may indicate the need for urgent chest tube replacement. Depending on the case, the OR will need to be prepared for an emergency thoracotomy.
