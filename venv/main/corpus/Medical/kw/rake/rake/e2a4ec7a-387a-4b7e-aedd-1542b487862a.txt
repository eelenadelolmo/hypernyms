MLO views before and  after obtained  after the procedure demonstrate a lucent defect in the area of biopsy.  A metallic clip is present, lying superior (cranial) to the site of biopsy, along the biopsy needle tract, on the MLO view.
Clip Migration Following Sterotactic Core Breast Biopsy
A 67 year old woman who underwent sterotactic core biopsy for a suspicious group of calcifications in the lower half of the left breast.  A crainiocaudal  from below approach was used.
Small masses or microcalcifications are sometimes completely removed at stereotactic core biopsy.  A metal clip is often deployed through the biopsy needle to mark the target.  Should another procedure, such as an excisional biopsy, be required at the same area, the clip aids in re-identification of the target.  In some cases, placement of a clip is also helpful to confirm that the biopsy site and intended target are identical. 
	Clip migration is a well-known phenomenon.  If it is not recognized, confusion can arise regarding the location and results of the original biopsy procedure.  Clip migration may be immediate or delayed, and occurs through a number of mechanisms.
	Most commonly, the clip migrates with re-expanding breast tissue when compression is released at the conclusion of a stereotactic biopsy.   The clip follows the tract of the biopsy needle in the direction the breast was compressed.    This is known as the &#8220;accordion effect&#8221;.  It occurs more commonly in fatty breasts and is best demonstrated in the plane orthogonal to compression.  
	Delayed migration along the tract also occurs more frequently in fatty breasts.  Occasionally a clip will be displaced by a hematoma or &#8220;float&#8221; within a hematoma.  Changes in breast size following reduction mammoplasty or in tumor size following neoadjuvant chemotherapy may also result in clip migration.
	Post procedure mammograms are helpful to confirm the proximity of the clip to the site of biopsy.  Prior to needle localization of an area previously marked with a clip, two orthogonal views are recommended to determine the exact location of the clip with regard to the lesion.
