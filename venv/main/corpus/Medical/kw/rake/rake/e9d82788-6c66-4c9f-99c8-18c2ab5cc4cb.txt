• Perforate anus
• Single urogenital opening (urethro-vaginal orifice)  
• Elevated 17 hydroxyprogesterone
Given the patients moderate degree of virilization and visualized cervix, female gender is confidently assigned. She will be treated with hydrocortisone for signs of adrenal crisis.  Serum electrolytes, especially Na+, as well as blood glucose will be closely monitored.  Given the risk of severe and recurrent urinary tract infections in patients with a persistent urovaginal sinus, a vaginoplasty is recommended in most genetically female (46 XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia who do not have fully masculinized external genitalia.
• Normal bowel gas pattern (non-obstructed) on scout radiograph

• Fluoroscopic Vagino-urethrogram demonstrated contrast opacifying the vagina and then the bladder. A urethral connection with the vaginal orifice close to the skin surface was identified.  There was no abnormal connection with the rectum.  Otherwise, the bladder and vagina are grossly normal in morphology.
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Virilized urogenital sinus
• Virilized urogenital sinus
• Cloacal malformation
2 month old baby girl with abnormal genitalia.
Diagnosis is confirmed by absence of bowel abnormality with perforate anus, physical exam consistent with moderately viralized female genitalia, elevated 17-OH progesterone levels and imaging showing urethra entering canal with normal bladder filling and cervix visualized on later imaging.

Given the patients history of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, known female karyotype with clitoralmegley and single urogenial orifice, a vagino-urethrogram was performed to determine the anatomy of the patient’s genitourinary malformations and rule out the presence of proximal bowl involvement. 

In order to perform the study, a Foley catheter was fixed at the opening of the single urethrovaginal orifice, and iodinated contrast material was administered via hand infusion. The initial films showed a non-obstructed bowl gas pattern indicating that there was no colonic or anal malformation ruling out the diagnosis of a cloacal malformation. The contrast study was also required for the determination of the location of vaginal and urethral insertion into the sinus so that the proper corrective surgical approach could be determined.

Although a vagino-cystogram was selected as the imaging study of choice in this case, ultrasound and vagino-cystoscopy may also have been useful studies in the diagnostic approach to this patient.
