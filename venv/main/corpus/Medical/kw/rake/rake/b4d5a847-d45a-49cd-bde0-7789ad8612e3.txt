Review of the patient's record revealed history of Granular Cell tumors removed from the right thigh and abdominal wall in 1995.
Recommend correlation with history and biopsy as needed
Not Shown: No new lung mass (atelectasis)
Right sided, slightly hyperdense 2cm mid renal mass with iso-hypo metabolic activity relative to the rest of the kidney.

Shown: PET/CT images of four Cutaneous and Subcutaneous masses with increased metabolic activity with SUV approximately 2.5. Which had enlarged slightly since the CT examination almost 2 years prior.
