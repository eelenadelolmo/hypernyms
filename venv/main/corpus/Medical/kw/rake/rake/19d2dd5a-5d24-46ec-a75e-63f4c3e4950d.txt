Normal physical exam.

Mildly anemic, normal cardiac enzymes.

The initial PA chest radiograph only showed non-specific enlargement of the cardiac sillhouette.  An echocardiogram was performed(images not available), which demonstrated a right atrial mass.  A CT and MRI was then performed.  Both studies demonstrated a large mediastinal mass involving the SVC and right atrium.  Supraclavicular lymphadenopathy was also seen.  The MRI findings strongly indicated an infiltrative type process.
Hodgkin's Lymphoma
<li> Lymphoma
<li> Angiosarcoma

Less likely:
<li> Germ cell tumor (seminoma, teratoma)
<li> Fibrous tumor of the pleura / pericardium
<li> Thymic carcinoma
<li> Metastasis
<li> Sarcoidosis
21 year-old man presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath, 15 lb weight loss, exercise intolerance, and anemia.
Patient was found to have a large mass involving the right atrium on a recent echocardiogram.

This was an interesting case of a patient with vague symptomatology and a chest radiograph at presentation that was not very impressive, given the extent of disease that was later revealed with cross-sectional imaging.  Ultrasound guided FNA was instrumental in clinching the diagnosis.
