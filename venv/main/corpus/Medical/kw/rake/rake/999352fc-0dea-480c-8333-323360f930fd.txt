PE is remarkable only for focal back pain, there was no cervical or supraclavicular adenopathy. Patient was Afebrile with stable vital signs. CA-125 of 48 and LDH of 740 were both elevated.
Chemotherapy CHOP-Rituximab six cycles. Evaluation for adjuvant radiation thereapy may be warranted.
MRI showed L3 compression fracture and large pelvic mass. Subsequent CT with contrast revealed a 12 x18 heterogeneous multiloculated pelvic mass with adjacent collections of low density free fluid, a soft tissue density mass measuring 4 x 7.4 cm at superior pole of right kidney and a 7.6 x 7.2 cm fluid-filled collection anterior to ascending colon. An aortocaval lymphnode measuring 12x13 mm and additional sub-centimeter nodes were identified. Interval CT evaluation after second cycle of CHOP-R treatment showed complete resolution of Right renal mass, interval decrease of aortocaval node, and interval decrease of pelvic mass now measuring 12.7 x 7.2 cm. The L3 compression fracture is stable.
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
(1) Ovarian Carcinoma (2) Acute leukemia, 3) Hepatocellular carcinoma, 4) Non Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, (5) Pancreatic tumor
This 50-year-old post menopausal woman presented with progressive back pain of two months duration with worsening after a fall two weeks ago.  She reports night sweats but no fever, chills or weight loss.  She also reports some lower extremity weakness.
MRI of spine showed L3 compression fracture and incidental finding of a large pelvic mass. She reports night sweats but no fever, chills or weight loss. The mass was worrisome for malignancy. The patient also reports some low extremity weakness.  The patient has an IPI (International Prognostic Index) of 3, meeting criteria for LDH, stage, and extra-nodal disease and thus appears to have a poor prognosis. In the presence of a pathological bone fracture (L3) the patient’s clinical condition raises the suspicion whether this may either be due to primary or secondary Non Hodgkin’s lymphoma of the bone. In a retrospective study of 23 patients with Primary Non Hodgkin’s lymphoma of the bone (PLB) it was found that most were due to Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma and three cases involved pathologic bone fractures. According to this study Computed Tomography and roentgenography alone were not sufficient to diagnose PLB and that diagnosis must be confirmed according to clinical features (localized pain and tenderness), pathological findings and immunohistochemistry assay [4]. Our patient meets these confirmatory measures and given the fact that the therapeutic procedure for PLB mainly includes local radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy, our patient may best benefit from adjunctive radiotherapy.
