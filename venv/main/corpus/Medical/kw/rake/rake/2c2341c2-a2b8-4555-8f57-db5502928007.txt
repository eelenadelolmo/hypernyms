Firm abdominal mass in midline.
Surical removal without complication
KUB demonstrates calcified fetus with overlapping skull fragments, some extremity recognition such as radius and ulna, etc.
Lithopedian
Fetus-in-fetu (usually with twin and within a twin)
Teratoma (usually disorganized)
Lithopedian (fetal demise, retained fetus with calcification)
Obese woman with abdominal pain for a year
Lithopedian occurs with retention of a dead fetus for months or years, resulting in dystrophic calcification.  Prolonged retention after fetal demise is unusual and may be associated with obesity - where the preganancy was not recognized.  

Described in association with ovarian pregancy.  Ovarian pregnancy is very rare and usually ruptures before the end of the first trimester.
