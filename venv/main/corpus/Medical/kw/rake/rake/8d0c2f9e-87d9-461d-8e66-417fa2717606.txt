• Positive CSF for tau
• Positive CSF for 14-3-3 protein
• Abnormal EEG with sharply contoured slow wave activity left frontal and temporal region.
Supportive
Abnormal signal involving head of caudate, putamen, and left partietal cortex on Flair, T2, DWI and ADC map.
No pathologic enhancement or mass effect.
Spongiform Encephalopathy;  presumed variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease
Post-ictal state.
Encephalitis
Infarction
68 year old woman admitted to neurology service with altered mental status and  new onset seizures.
Positive CSF for tau; and, positive CSF for 14-3-3 protein -  suggested to be 85% specific for CJD.

"Both 14-3-3 and tau protein are sensitive and specific biomarkers for CJD. The combination of 14-3-3 and b amyloid analysis resulted in the maximum sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. When these biomarkers are used in the diagnosis of CJD, the phase of the disease in which the CSF sample was obtained should be taken into account. Disease duration, dependent on the PrP genotype, also has a significant influence on the level of 14-3-3 and tau in the CSF."
