Decreased weakness of upper extremeties.
Unknown
MR imaging may show foci of high-velocity signal loss within the enlarged vessels.  This cord is not atrophic, and no high signal intensity is  observed on T2-weighted scans.  There is no hemorrhagic residu present.  All of the above may be seen in Spinal dural AV fistula
Dural arteriovenous fistula, cervical spine
Dural AV fistula
Dephasing from turbulent CSF flow 
Multiple sclerosis
ADEM
66 year old female with progressive neck pain and increasing weakness in her upper extremeties.
This case nicely demonstrates the flow voids seen in dural arteriovenous fistulas.  These lesions are important to recognize and treat early in order to prevent unnecessary neurologic loss.
