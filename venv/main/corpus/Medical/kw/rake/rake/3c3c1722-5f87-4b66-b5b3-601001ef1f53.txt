Hypertensive and anxious
The patient went on to have surgery and is still recovering.
• CXR findings:
-widening of the superior mediastinum, nonspecific

• CT findings:
-intimal flap
-two separate lumens
-soft-tissue mass surrounding great vessels
Aortic dissection
In an elderly patient w/ chest pain and a widened mediastinum on CXR, a CT should be obtained, as an aortic dissection is the most dangerous acute condition; and, it should be evaluated urgently.
74 yo woman with "tearing" chest pain.
This is a classic appearance of an aortic dissection:  an elderly patient complaining of chest pain, maybe penetrating through to the back, with a widened mediastinum.  In this setting, a dissection must be ruled out.

• The Goals of imaging studies include:
-Determine ascending aorta involvement
-Determine origin and extent of dissection
-Define branch vessel involvement: coronary arteries, great vessels, mesenteric and renals, iliac arteries
-Find the intimal flap and entry/reentry points
-Determine if there is aortic regurgitation
-Eval patency of false lumen
-Determine if there is extrathoracic hematoma (pericardial, paraaortic, wall thickening)

-CT is more accurate in detection of
	thrombosed false channels
	periaortic hematoma and pericardial/pleural blood
	isolated aortic wall hematoma
-CT not accurate in eval of
	great vessels and coronaries
	aortic valve
	entry or exit sites
-Role of CT
	triage patients w/ equivocal findings
	surveillance of chronic dissections
