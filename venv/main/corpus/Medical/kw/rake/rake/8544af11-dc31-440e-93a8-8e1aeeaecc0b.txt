Negative clinical breast exam by experienced surgeon, negative screening mammography. Genetics testing revealed BRCA-1 positivity.
Patient will undergo lymphoscintigraphy for sentinal node biopsy. If no metastases, she will likely opt for breast conservation therapy to include lumpectomy and radiation.  She is considering the option of bilateral mastectomy.  She will require continued close monitoring for development of additional disease.
Initial screening two view mammogram was negative for suspicious calcifications or mass.  The brest tissue was heterogenously dense.

Patient underwent routine screeing breast MR which demonstrates a small enhancing mass within the mid right breast, 12:00 position.  There is minimal associated T2 hyperintensity, but this involves more the periphery of the lesion, rather than the substance of the lesion itslef.  No other discordant foci of abnormal enhancement were present within either breast.

The patient was recalled for subsequent right breast ultrasound.  This demonstrates an angulated, hypoechoic 5mm mass in at the 12:00 position, zone 1a.

Subsequent ultrasound-guided 14ga core biopsy was performed.

32 year-old female, asymptomatic with respect to the breasts.   Patient has a mother and sister with breast cancer before age 45.  She is 10 months postpartum, is no longer lactating, but is trying to get pregnant.
The issue of screening high risk patients with breast MR has been discussed for several years.  It has taken some time for vendors to develop the software necessary to accurately and efficiently use existing MR technology for a screening population.  MR utility has been extensively used for problem-solving and for evaluation of the patient with impants. 

The exquisite contrast sensitivity of MR is balanced in the high-risk patient by somewhat decreased specificity; many things other than cancer enhance, but benign entities often have an intrinsic high T2 signal whereas breast cancer does not.

Sensitivity has been greatly improved with the use of dynamic contrast-enhancement, and the addition of software tools allowing the creation of a graphical depiction of contrast kinetics within a specified region of interest.  Given that the region is selected appropriately, breast cancer tissue will typically exhibit an early wash-in, and a rapid wash-out of contrast enhancement.  In contradistinction, beningn tissue will demonstrate a progressive increase in enhancement or alternatively a plateau. 

Software refinements continue to be made in order to hopefully better define the specific region of interest and therefore yield the best curve.

At the time this case was performed, the combination fo software and hardware technology necessary to perform adequate screening MR had only been available for approximately 2 months.  This patient's cancer was only detectable initially through this modality.  The mammogram was, even retrospectively, negative, and there was no palpable abnormality for which to justify an ultrasound (although the lesion was in fact visible under ultrasound).  This cancer almost certainly would have not been found until it was at a much more advanced state, and this patient's life may have just been saved-- a feat that would have likely not been possible just a few months ago.
