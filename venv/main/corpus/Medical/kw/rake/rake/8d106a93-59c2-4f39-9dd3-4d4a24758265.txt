Head circumference 97th percentile, increased from 50th percentile only 1 month prior.  Some neck hypotonia, unable to lift head in the prone position.  Some sundowning of the eyes.
Surgical resection and follow-up imaging.
MR: Lobulated, intensely enhancing, fungating mass extending superiorly from the region of the third ventricle along the septum pellucidum measuring approximately 5.3 x 4.3 x 4.8cm (CC x AP x transverse).  There is associated obstructive hydrocephalus of the third and lateral ventricles.  Diffusion weighted images are unremarkable.
Choroid plexus papilloma
• choroid plexus tumor (papilloma or carcinoma)
• PNET
• atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor
• ependymoma
2 month old boy with rapidly increasing head circumference.
Choroid plexus papilloma is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the epithelium lining the papillae of the choroid plexus.  It is most frequently encountered in children under the age of 5 but can present in adulthood as well.  Although choroid plexus papillomas account for less than 1% of intracranial tumors in children of all ages, they represent 12-13% of intracranial tumors in children under the age of 1 year.

Choroid plexus papillomas typically arise in the lateral ventricles in the pediatric population, with the fourth and third ventricles being less common.  Choroid plexus papillomas are typically discovered when they cause symptoms related to hydrocephalus.

Typical MR appearance of a choroid plexus papilloma is a lobular intraventricular mass that is homogeneous on T1 weighted images.  On T2 weighted images, the central portion is typically hypointense to gray matter.  Uniform, intense enhancement occurs following administration of gadolinium.  Occasionally, foci of hemorrhage or calcification are present.
