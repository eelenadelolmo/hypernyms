Texto: 
Non-localized tenderness of the medial and lateral left knee. Fullness of the distal femur. No pain on full ROM. Otherwise normal systems examination.
Evolution of disease in this patient:
1. Diagnosis of left distal femur osteosarcoma January 2011. 
2. Resection and left leg salvaging surgery March 2011. 
3. Follow up scans post chemotherapy showed new lesions in proximal right humerus, sternum, right transverse process L5 and possible region in right distal femur. 
4. Recently admitted for right shoulder surgery. 

Treatment: Chemotherapy, complicated by febrile neutropenia and clostridium difficile enterocolitis. Following chemotherapy he then underwent limb salvage procedure of his left leg for resection of his left distal femur osteosarcoma. Treatment for recurrance of disease to involve right shoulder surgery, further chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
The bony lesions show marked sclerosis with periosteal elevation and new bone formation surrounding the lesion. This is a characteristic appearance of osteosarcoma. Bony metastasis later occured following chemotherapy and right lower limb salvage surgery.
Osteosarcoma
1. Ewing’s sarcoma – same age range and male predominance as osteosarcoma, radiographs show a metaphyseal or diaphyseal tumor with a lytic appearance, biopsy confirms diagnosis as no osteoid production is seen and instead shows small blue cell tumor

2. Metastasis from other malignancies – usually occur in older age groups with a history of a primary malignancy known to metastasise to the bone. 

3. Osteomyelitis – usually associated with fever and elevated inflammatory markers, associated periosteal reaction on radiographs

4. Osteoblastoma – roughly same age range and sex distribution as osteosarcoma, lesions are more common in the spine, radiography shows radiolucent lesion in the long bone metaphysic or posterior arch of a vertebrae with a central radiodense area

5. Aneurysmal bone cyst – radiographs show a radiolucent expansile bone lesion, same age range and location as osteosarcoma

6. Fibrous dysplasia – wide age range, radiographs show a ground glass appearance and no associated soft tissue mass, no aggressive features but a pathological fracture may occur
15 year old boy with left knee pain for the past 2 months. Recalls falling over on ice with left knee pain some time ago but reported no known trauma at time of injury. No limp. No other symptoms on systems review. 
PMHx: Asthma, OCD, thalassemia minor, ADHD.
