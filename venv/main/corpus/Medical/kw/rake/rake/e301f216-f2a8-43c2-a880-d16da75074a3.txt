Vital signs demonstrated hemodynamic stability without fever.  She presented with irritability and poor consolability for mother. She exhibited a flat, soft anterior fontanelle, large symmetric and reactive pupils with normal red reflex, and stiff neck unremarkable for lymphadenopathy or stridor.  Skin and mucous membranes demonstrated evidence of mild volume depletion.  Neurologic examination demonstrated increased tone, symmetric startle and fence, but progressed over 48 hours to generalized seizure activity.

CBC:
       WBC: 2100/mm3 (21% band-types)
        Hb: 9.5gm/dl

This patient was treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as acyclovir, until the CSF results clearly identified GBS, at which time therapy was tailored and continued for one month.  She developed a dense left hemiparesis, and continued with intermittent seizures.
       At six months, her hemiparesis has essentially resolved.  She has been on an anticonvulsant without further seizures, though ongoing EEG monitoring reveals some sub-clinical seizure activity.  She demonstrates a subtle right torticollis.  Communicating hydrocephalus was treated with CSF diversion via right parietal occipital ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
	She is obtaining ongoing follow-up with neurosurgery and developmental pediatrics.

Day 5 MRI
     DWI: Patchy left-hemispheric areas of restricted diffusion compatible with  ischemia.    
      MRV: the is no flow void in straight sinus.
Meningitis with dehydration, straight sinus thrombosis and venous infarction.

Venous Infarct
Cerebritis with stroke
This 4-week old female was the product of a term Cesarean section for fetal intolerance of labor.  Maternal history included a positive antenatal Group B Streptococcus screen.  Intrapartum prophylactic antibiotic treatment was administered, and the infant was observed by sepsis screen protocol in the neonatal intensive care unit, and discharged home without significant findings.  A 2-week well-baby examination was benign.  She presented to the emergency department at 4 weeks of age with irritability, poor feeding, and high-pitched cry.
