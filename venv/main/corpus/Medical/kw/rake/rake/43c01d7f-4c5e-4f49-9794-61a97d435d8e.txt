OB ultrasound examination of the c-spine demonstrates multiple loops of fetal cord around the fetal neck.  The rest of the anatomy scan is WNL. A four chambered heart was seen beating at 150 BPM.  All limbs are moving and grosely normal on inspection.
Fetal Nuchal Cords
Fetal cord draped over neck.
Abnormally long fetal cord coiled behind neck.
Normal fetal cord
24 YO Hispanic woman G2 P1001 present for OB ultrasound to review anatomy and to verify dates.
This was a typical case and expected outcome.  The diagnosis of a nuchal cord puts all radiologists on at an ethical dilemna -- to report and potentially impose an unnecessay burden on both the OB/GYN physician and the patient or not to report and risk a potentially preventable death or lawsuit.
