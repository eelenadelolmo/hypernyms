Vital signs - stable.
Abdomen - +BS, soft, nontender.
Pelvis - Lg uterine fundus approximates 14 weeks. Mildly tender adnexae. Nl ovaries by manual palpation.

Labs - 
1) Hct 28. 
2) HCG - negative.
3) Normal gyn cytology.
At our institution, we recommend:
1) Follow up cross sectional imaging in 4-6 months and at 1 year.
2) OBGYN & IR follow up at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year.
MRI PELVIS:
1) SAG T2 image of a myomatous uterus. A large submucosal fibroid is shown to best advantage. There are also several small intramural fibroids. 
2) COR T2 image of a myomatous uterus. This image nicely depicts the orientation/location of the fibroids relative to the uterine cavity. In addition to the submucosal fibroid, there are several smaller intramural fibroids, and at least 2 large, exophytic, broad-based subserosal fibroids.
3) AX T2 image of myomatous uterus. This image nicely depicts the orientation/location of the fibroids relative to the uterine cavity. 
 
UTERINE ARTERY EMBOLIZATION:
1) PELVIC ARTERIOGRAM - Preprocedure arteriogram to evaluate for the course and caliber of the uterine arteries.
2a-c) LEFT UTERINE ARTERY SELECTIVE EMBOLIZATION WITH EMBOSPHERES.
3a-c) RIGHT UTERINE ARTERY SELECTIVE EMBOLIZATION WITH EMBOSPHERES.
4) PELVIS - Post embolization uterine blush secondary to contrast-suspension of embospheres.
UTERINE FIBROID EMBOLIZATION
MYOMATOUS UTERUS. STATUS POST THERAPEUTIC UTERINE ARTERY EMBOLIZATION.
45 year old perimenopausal female with menorrhagia, pelvic pain and pressure, and urinary frequency. She does not desire future fertility.
