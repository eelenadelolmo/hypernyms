WBC 6000
Positive PPD
Patient was admitted for treatment of tuberculosis with IV antibiotics.
Chest radiograph demonstrates biapical reticulonodular opacities with a cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe.

CT: Chest CT demonstrates tree-in-bud opacities in the upper lobes and mid lungs with a cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe.  Right hilar lymphadenopathy was present.

Lumbar spine demonstrates L3-4 intervertebral disk space narrowing with irregularity of the end plates and no osteophyte formation.

MRI:  Right paravertebral rim enhancing fluid is demonstrated adjacent to the L4 level.  Marrow edema is present in L3 through L5.
Reactivation tuberculosis (TB) Vertebral osteomyelitis, paraspinal psoas abscess
Spinal involvement:
Metastasis
Brucellosis
Fungal infection
Sarcoid
23 y.o. man with a chronic cough, thought to be secondary to allergies.  He also has a history of chronic low back pain.
SPINE:  Radiographic findings associating pulmonary disease and vertebral osteomyelitis was strongly suggestive for tuberculosis and Pott disease.

The spine is the most common osseous site of involvement for tuberculosis with the most common level being L1.  More than one vertebral body is affected as was the case in this patient.  Paraspinal involvement extending to the psoas may occur.

The diagnosis for tuberculosis is favored in cases where there is a calcified paravertebral mass and absent sclerosis or bone formation.

CHEST:  The radiographic findings of upper lobe parenchymal disease with cavitation is characteristic for reactivation tuberculosis.  The earliest finding is patchy, ill defined segmental consolidation.  

Tree in bud appearance denotes centrilobular nodules with branching centrolobular opacities is characteristic but not pathognomonic for active disease.
