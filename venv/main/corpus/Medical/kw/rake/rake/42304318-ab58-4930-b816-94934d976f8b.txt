In Film 1 the gallbladder (GB) wall is markedly thickened (1.7 cm), with a lamellated or striated appearance.  Ascites is present.  Portal venous flow (not shown) is hepatopetal, normal in direction.  One day later (Film 2), the GB wall thickening has increased to the point (2.3 cm) that the lumen is now obliterated.  Portal venous flow (Film 3) has reversed and is now hepatofugal.
Gallbladder wall thickening, secondary to portal venous hypertension from hepatic venocclusive disease (after bone marrow transplant)
This is a 39-year-old female five and six days after bone marrow transplant for aplastic anemia.  She had received chemotherapy and total lymphoid radiation prior to the transplant.  Right upper quadrant pain and tenderness have been increasing for several days.  Two ultrasound examinations are performed, the initial one at 5 days (Film 1) and the follow-up at 6 days (Films 2 and 3).
GB wall thickening is a non-specific finding and can be seen with both intrinsic and extrinsic disease processes.  Acute and chronic cholecystitis are the most common intrinsic causes of GB wall thickening and the degree of thickening can be marked.  A striated appearance of the wall from alternating hyperechoic and anechoic regions has been shown to occur more frequently in acute cholecystitis but can also be seen with extrinsic disease, as shown in this case.  Even though stones and sludge are often present, especially with chronic cholecystitis, they can be absent.  Pericholecystic fluid and ascites are significantly associated with perforation when acute cholecystitis is present, but these findings may also occur with extrinsic disease.  When bright hyperechoic intramural foci are seen, emphysematous and gangrenous cholecystitis should be considered, but again, these findings are non-specific.  The clinical situation is often very helpful in determining the significance of these findings.  Other intrinsic causes of GB wall thickening include adenomyomatosis and both primary and metastatic malignancy.  GB wall thickening can be diffuse, focal, or even circumferential with adenomyomatosis, whereas malignancy is usually focal.  Malignant changes can extend intraluminally or extrinsically as well.

On occasion, if the patient has eaten prior to the ultrasound study, the GB may be normally contracted and have thick walls.  The wall usually has three layers.  

Extrinsic causes of GB wall thickening are numerous and include AIDS, hepatitis, sepsis, hypoalbuminemia, congestive heart failure, amyloidosis, lymphatic obstruction, and portal hypertension from any cause.  Ascites has been associated with GB wall thickening.  While this may be technical, related to beam spreading artifact, it is more commonly associated with hypoalbuminemia and/or portal hypertension.

GB wall thickening in AIDS has been associated with cytomegalic virus (CMV), cryptosporidium, and Mycobacterium infections.  Intrinsic inflammatory cell infiltrate has been documented, but many cases are likely to be secondary to primary liver involvement, cholangitis, or more diffuse abdominal infection.

Hypoalbuminemia has been well documented as a cause of GB wall thickening, but values <2.5 g/dl are usually necessary.  Malignant ascites has not been associated with GB wall thickening, except when the albumin level is low.

Portal hypertension with or without hypoalbuminemia is commonly the cause of GB wall thickening most often associated with cirrhosis.  The findings in this patient are of acute and fulminant portal hypertension from hepatic venocclusive disease.  The portal hypertension develops because of occlusion of the venous outflow at the level of the terminal hepatic venules and sublobular veins.  Since the major hepatic veins are not involved, this distinguishes this entity from the classic Budd-Chiari syndrome, even though both may cause acute portal hypertension.  It is believed the chemotherapy and radiation directly damage the venules as well as the hepatocytes.  Further damage to the hepatocytes occurs from the congestion and hypoxia.  Graft-versus-host disease may also cause portal hypertension in bone marrow transplant patients, but the development is much more chronic and occurs well after the onset of disease.

Marked GB wall thickening (>1.0 cm) is most commonly found with acute cholecystitis, hepatitis, and hepatic venous occlusion.  The striated appearance in the GB wall may be related pathologically to hemorrhagic edema.  As mentioned previously, this finding has also been significantly associated with acute cholecystitis.  The clinical setting and correlation with other findings should help determine the value of this finding for a given patient.  As much of this discussion has focused on hepatic venocclusive disease, it should be emphasized that hepatic venocclusive disease is rare except in a small subset of patients.  Acute cholecystitis, however, is common.

To determine the direction of flow with duplex Doppler, the angle of the transducer, the angle of the vessel being sampled, and the relationship of the spectral tracing to the baseline are the key considerations.  Flow in the vessel toward the transducer registers the spectral tracing above the baseline, whereas flow away from the transducer registers below the baseline (unless manually inverted).  In this patient, the spectral tracing from the portal vein is below the baseline on day 6 (Film 3).  The transducer angles from the patient's right to left, and the spectral tracing registers below the baseline, indicating flow away from the transducer, right to left, or abnormal hepatofugal flow
