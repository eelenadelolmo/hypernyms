Images from a multiphase CT exam of the pancreas demonstrates a complex cystic mass centered in the head of the pancreas with enhancing internal septa and multiple cysts, some of which are < 2cm in size. The cysts averaged fluid attenuation on all sequences. On the nonenhanced image, dystrophic calcification is noted within the cyst wall. No intra or extrahepatic or pancreatic ductal dilatation.
Microcystic (serous) adenoma of the pancreas
Serous cystadenoma (Microcystic)
Mucinous cystadenoma/Cystadenocarcinoma (Macrocystic)
Intraductal papillary mucinous tumor
Nonfunctioning islet cell tumor
Metastatic disease
Ductal adenocarcinoma
with decreased appetite, elevated liver function tests.
