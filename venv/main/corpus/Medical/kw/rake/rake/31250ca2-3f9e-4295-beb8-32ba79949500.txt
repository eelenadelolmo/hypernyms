The presence of computed radiography cassette or imaging plate artifact was discussed with the technologist.  Cleaning of the cassettes and plates prevented continued image artifacts.  Due to clear demonstration of a fingerprint with magnification, repeat images were not obtained.
Mild hyperinflation is present, the lung are clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature within normal limits.   There is mild levocurvature of the thoracic spine, which is likely positional.   Incidental&#8232;note is made of an irregular density in the region of the left humeral head, which on close observation and with magnification is seen to represent a fingerprint artifact.
Fingerprint Artifact
