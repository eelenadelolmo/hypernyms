Temp 36.4, BP 122/77, P 80, RR 18 at 99% RA. 
Skin: Multiple facial angiofibromas. Multiple ash-leaf hypo-melanotic maculess on torso and extremities. 
Nails: Multiple nodular fleshy lesions scattered on digits—adjacent to and underneath nails;  
Rest of physical exam within normal limits
Labs: pending
1)	Periodic screening: Renal ultrasound/CT; Renal functioning tests to monitor for renal failure; Neuroimaging; High resolution CT of chest 
2)	Genetic counseling
3)	Counsel to avoid estrogen and cigarette smoke
4)	Support organizations
1.	Cortical tubers: MRI T2 axial showing high signal cortical lesions; 
2.	Subependymal tumors:  MRI T2 axial showing subependymal calcifications in left and right lateral ventricles
3.	Subependymal tumors: MRI T1 sagital showing high signal subependymal nodules. 
4.	Renal angiomyolipoma: Non-enhanced axial CT of the abdomen showing multiple renal lesions bilaterally; Attenuation equivocal to fat surrounding torso. 
5.	Small lung cysts (lymphangioleiomyomatosis): A high-resolution axial CT of the chest showing numerous bilateral well defined, thin walled cysts
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)
Kidney findings: Polycystic Kidney Disease, Wilm’s tumor, Renal Cell Carcinoma, Angiolipoma
Lung Findings: Emphysema, Bronchiectasis, Cystic fibrosis,  
Skin Findings: Acne, Hypopigmented nevus, Sebaceous adenoma
Brain Findings: Ependymoma, Gliomas, Glioblastoma multiforme, Craniopharyngioma, Astrocytoma
28 yo woman with history of seizures between 13 months- 12 years of age. Complaints of rare episodes of hemoptysis and 2 previous episodes of pneumothoraces in the same month.  Surgical history includes mechanical pleurodesis and kidney embolization. Mother also diagnosed with the same disease.
Diagnosing TSC is challenging because many of its characteristics may also be found without having TSC.  This patient displayed many of the associated characteristics to include the skin, brain, lung and kidney.
