Physical exam was positive for diffuse lower abdominal pain to palpation.  Her abdomen was soft and nondistended.  Her pain was not in the classic McBurney's point location. Otherwise normal physical exam.

Labs were normal except for a WBC count of 13.0 with a mild left shift.
None, this is self limiting.
There is a small focus of predominately fat attenuation on the anterior surface of the sigmoid colon.  There is a moderate amount of fat stranding adjacent to the area.  There are no areas of diverticulosis in the colon.  The remainder of the fat was clean.
Epiploic Appendigitis.
1. Epiploic Appendigitis
2. Diverticulosis.
Patient is a 30 year old female who presented to the emergency department after 3 days of low abdominal pain.  She denied vaginal bleeding and or changes in her menstral cycle. She denied vomiting and changes in bowel function or habits.  She endorsed low grade fevers.  Otherwise no medical problems and no surgical history.
This case again demonstrates one of the relatively common appendicitis mimickers.   This study was obtained to assess for appendicitis in this patient with low abdominal pain and a mildly elevated WBC.
