Currently undergoing treatment by General Surgery and Oncology.
Chest X-ray demonstrates a ‘lingular consolidation’.


Chest CT demonstrates a 6.0x5.4cm mass centered in the lingula of the lung.  This lesion has central low attenuation and a small focus of air.  Peripherally, there is a rind of higher attenuation.  A 3 cm lymph node is demonstrated in the left paratracheal region.
Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC)
Primary Malignant Neoplasm
Metastatic disease
Lymphoma
Granulomatous disease
Inflammatory process, Pneumonia or Abscess
Congenital abnormality
63-year-old female with history of breast cancer in the Emergency Department, rule out pneumonia.  Complains of shortness of breath, fever, and white count.
The initial radiograph for the patient's presentation was a lingular infiltrate.  This was a well circumscribed mass without an air bronchogram.  Follow up radiographs demonstrated no interval change.  Given the patient's history of breast cancer, the presumptive diagnosis was metastatic breast cancer.

Imaging findings demonstrated a well circumscribed mass with central decreased attenuation in the lingula.  With the central distribution and associated massive adenopathy, a neoplasm such as a primary malignant neoplasm was at the top of the differential.  Further workup included a bronchoscopy which showed no malignant cells.  A fine needle aspiration confirmed the diagnosis of NSCLC.
