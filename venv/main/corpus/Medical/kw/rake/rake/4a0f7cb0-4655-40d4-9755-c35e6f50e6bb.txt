Texto: 
Abdomen soft, tender right flank, non-distended, no guarding or rebound tenderness.  No appreciable mass or HSM.
None required.
CT, ABDOMEN, WITH CONTRAST MATERIAL:
  
Note is made of a vague area of hyperdensity seen in the right lobe of the liver inferolaterally measuring 1.7 x 1.6 cm.  Delayed images demonstrate this area to be less conspicuous.  There is no liver laceration identified and there is no free fluid or inflammation 
seen in the abdomen or pelvis.  Remainder of the liver demonstrates mild fatty infiltration, without evidence of focal lesion.  The liver is normal in size and normal in contour.   Ultrasound of the liver is recommended for further evaluation.

US, ABDOMINAL LIMITED:

There is diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver, moderate in degree, obscuring portal vein walls.  The liver demonstrates a wedge-shaped area along the lateral aspect ofthe right inferior segment that extends from its apex at a hepatic vein branch to the capsule.  This demonstrates normal vessels traversing the region. There is no distortion of the capsule or contour.  This is triangular in configuration.  No free fluid is identified.
