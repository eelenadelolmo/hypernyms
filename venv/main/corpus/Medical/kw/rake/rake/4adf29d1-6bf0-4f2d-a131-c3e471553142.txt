Afebrile. Normal vital signs.
ESR = 19 (1 - 19)
WBC = 6.2
- Blood cultures negative.
- IV antibiotics.
1) Plain film: Left 2nd proximal phalanx demonstrates a mottled, poorly defined, permeative destruction of intramedullary bone with endosteal resorption. There is poor definition between normal and abnormal bone.
2) Select MRI SAG STIR image: High signal throughout the bone marrow of the left 2nd proximal phalynx. 
3) Select MRI T1 SAG post GAD fat sat image: Enhancement throughout the left 2nd proximal phalanx. Volar aspect cortical interruption.
4) Select MRI COR T1 image: Proximal-most aspect of the proximal 2nd phalanx demonstrates only remaining normal marrow signal (T1 bright fatty marrow).
5) Select MRI AX T2 image: Sinus tract from the marrow cavity through the adjacent cortex.
OSTEOMYELITIS
1) Osteomyelitis.
2) EG
3) Malignant bone tumor
Less likely:
4) Other benign cystic lesions of bone
History of injury to left second finger January 2004 presents with pain and swelling at proximal phalanx, 2nd ray.
See Factoid discussion.
