Lateral joint line tenderness and mild lateral joint line swelling.
Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy and cyst decompression.
Coronal FSE T2 fat saturated and sagittal FSE proton density-weighted MR images through the right knee show a cystic, high T2-signal intensity mass adjacent to the midportion of the lateral meniscus, with an associated horizontal tear of the lateral meniscus.  Note also the radial tear through the lateral meniscus.
Meniscal Cyst and lateral meniscal tear.
Lateral Meniscal tear versus intrameniscal cyst.

Associated parameniscal cyst versus meniscocapsular separation versus bursitis.
A 30-year-old Caucasian male with intermittent right knee locking, popping, and lateral joint line swelling.
