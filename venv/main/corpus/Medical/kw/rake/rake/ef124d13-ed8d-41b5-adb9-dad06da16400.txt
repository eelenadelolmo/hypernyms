Rales in the right lower lung base otherwise unremarkable physical exam.

D-Dimer is elevated.
This patient was treated with antibiotics and a bronchodialator.  He will be followed with serial imaging until resolution of symptoms.
Chest X-ray PA and LAT demonstrate opacification of the post segment of the right lung consistent with known pulmonary disease.

CT chest angiogram with coronal reformatted images demonstrates a posterior segment right lower lobe consolidation associated with an anomalous feeding vessel from the aorta and drainage via the pulmonary vein.  There is also a small pleural effusion, likely secondary to a superimposed pneumonia on a intralobar sequestration.
Intralobar Pulmonary Sequestration with superimposed pneumonia
Pneumonia associated with  
- Intralobar Sequestration
- Extralobar Sequestration
- Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation
Bronchogenic carcinoma with or without infection
46 year old man presents to the ER after being diagnosed 2 days ago with pneumonia.  He now complains of increasing shortness of breath, productive sputum, and fever despite antibiotic treatment.
This case illustrates a near classic example of intralobar pulmonary sequestration.  The question to surgically treat is always difficult.  Currently there is little data supporting aggressive surgical treatment over conservative follow up.  In someone who has been asymptomatic for 46 years, there is a chance that a successful treatment with antibiotics might make this symptomatic episode his last.  Never the less, if he continues to develop repeated infections in this area or develops other complications options for treatment includes open surgery or less invasive embolization.
