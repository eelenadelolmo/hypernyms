This patient was pending surgical resection of the left rudimentary horn.
Patients with a unicornuate uterus and a communicating or non-communicating rudimentary horn, which contains endometrial tissue, typically undergo surgical resection secondary to dysmenorrhea and hematometria/cryptomenorrhea.  Those with a noncommunicating horn that contains endometrial lining are usually symptomatic due to obstruction of flow during menses.  In patients with communicating rudimentary horns, there is also potential for pregnancy within this hypoplastic horn and the vast majority result in uterine rupture.
Pelvic MRI shows a right unicornuate uterus with a non-communicating left rudimentary horn.  Normal ovaries containing follicles, the largest on the right 2.5cm.

In comparison retrospectively, pelvic US shows a right unicornuate uterus.  The questionable left ovarian mass corresponds to the non-communicating left rudimentary horn seen on MR.  The left ovary was not clearly identified.

Abdominal ultrasound showed normal kidneys (not uploaded to this case).
Unicornuate Uterus
None.
15 y/o female with recurrent, cyclic nausea, vomitting, and left lower quadrant pain at time of menses.  MRI recommended due to questionable left ovarian mass seen on ultrasound.
The patient's cyclic symptoms were attributed to probable cryptomenorrhea related to the non-communicating left rudimentary horn.
