Texto: 
No palpable masses with scars over both breasts. Otherwise, physical exam is noncontributory.
No treatment required. Annual mammogram recommended.
Mammogram performed on April 2004 to include the left and right breast CC and MLO views compared to mammogram performed November 1995. The breast tissues are predominantly fatty-replaced bilaterally.  Skin markers are present over the right breast upper outer quadrant and left breast midline on the CC views.
 
RIGHT BREAST:  Skin thickening is present in the retroareolar region.  Multiple predominantly fatty lesions centrally with peripheral calcifications ovoid in shape and subcentimeter to 1.5 centimeter in size are present in the upper outer quadrant of right breast.  There is no architectural distortion or suspicious clusters of microcalcification.
 
LEFT BREAST:  Multiple 1-1.5 cm round central lucent lesions are present with peripheral calcifications in the upper outer breast anterior third in a linear arrangement.  Subareolar skin thickening is present.  There are no suspicious clusters of microcalcification.
 
There is overall decreased volume within both breasts from the 2004 study compared to the 1995 study.
FAT NECROSIS
Fat necrosis
Traumatic oil cyst
Lipoma
Galactocele
Patient with history of breast cancer seen in Breast
Care Clinic for abnormal mammogram performed at outside facility. Patient has a history of breast cancer approximately 14 years prior.  Patient
also with history of bilateral breast surgery three years prior.
After trauma or surgical procedures, the breast may heal with a persistent area of architectural distortion. This is more notable when the surgery is extensive like reduction mammaplasty. Fat necrosis can occur but the large, lucent-centered calcifications are rarely confused morphologically with those produced by breast cancer. Nonanatomic parenchymal bands and scars have been also been described. There is often a swirling configuration to the remolded tissues, and isolated islands of breast tissue can be seen. Suture calcifications can also be seen after reduction mammoplasty.

Masses with rim-like pattern of calcifications are considered benign. Cysts appear to calcify in patches with a very thin layer of deposit, while fat necrosis tends to form a thicker rim. Confirmation by aspiration may be needed in questionable cases because the calcifications in the wall of a cyst can reduce the effectiveness of ultrasound in differentiating cyst from solid.
