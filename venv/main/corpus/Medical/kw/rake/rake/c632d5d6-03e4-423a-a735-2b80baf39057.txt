Texto: 
Tender, swollen calf without a discrete palpable mass.  

ESR, CRP, CBC, and Chem-12 were normal.
The patient improved with conservative treatment.
MRI demonstrates a heterogenous fluid collection(dark on T1/bright on T2)1.5cm AP x 18cm long x 4.7cm trv between the proximal soleus and medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle. Within the collection, there is decreased signal on T2 suggesting hemosiderin deposition due to hemmorhage.  

Ultrasound was negative for deep venous thrombosis but notable for a Baker cyst.
History, clinical course, and imaging findings compatible with tennis leg.
>>Hematoma
>>Complex Seroma
>>Ruptured Baker cyst
49 year old male with a two-month history of left calf pain and swelling.
1. Tennis leg is a differential possibility in patients who present with these clinical and imaging findings.
2. A fluid collection in this location can be hemorrhagic or cystic in nature. When hemorrhagic, rupture of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle should be considered. This finding makes tennis leg a more likely diagnosis.
3. DVT can mimic or complicate tennis leg.
