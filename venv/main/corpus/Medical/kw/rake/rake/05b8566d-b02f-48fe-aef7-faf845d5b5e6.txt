No back pain.
None.  Patient asymptomatic.
Thickened trabeculae of T10 vertebral body and its right posterior elements (with minimal expansion of involved posterior elements) with adjacent right paravertebral soft tissue mass.  No cortical destruction or periosteal reaction.  Increased signal on both T1w and T2w images confirms diagnosis vertebral hemangioma with extramedullary extension into right paravertebral region.
Vertebral hemangioma (diagnosed by MRI).
Hemangioma
Focal Paget's disease
Chondrosarcoma/osteosarcoma (unlikely given lack of aggressive features)
58 yo male status post debridement for neck infection had chest CT for further evaluation of mediastinal spread of infection (earlier neck CT showed mediastinal spread at inferiormost images).
See FACTOID.
