Asymptomatic.
None required.
Multiple 2-3 mm metallic linear densities seen scattered within the bilateral lower lung parenchyma.
Brachytherapy seed embolization
Aspirated metallic foreign body.
Schrapnel.
Surgical clips.
Embolized brachytherapy seeds.
60 y.o. man for followup
Brachytherapy seed embolization to the pulmonary arteries is a frequent occurance.  Patients should be informed of the phenomenon in case a question comes up on a future radiologic exam.  The tiny metallic seeds may be mistaken for aspirated metallic foreign bodies, or for schrapnel (which would be of more irregular shape).  But given the characteristic rod-like shape, identical to that found within the prostatic bed, the diagnosis is sealed.
