May resolve spontaneously either partially or completely. If clinical findings are significant another source for symptoms must be found prior to attributing them to osteitis condensans ilii, which is usually an incidental finding.
Homogeneous sclerosis of bilateral iliac margins of SI Joints.  Uniform joint spaces without erosions or irregularity.  Cortical margins are intact.
Osteitis Condensans Ilii
Inflammatory bowel disease
Ankylosing spondylitis  
Hyperparathyroidism
Gouty arthritis
Psoriatic arthritis
Reiters syndrome
Renal osteodystrophy
24 Female left lower lumbar pain for several days worse with bending and lifting. . .
Usually, bilateral symmetric, young multiparous females, with well defined triangular zone of sclerosis involving the inferior portion of the iliac aspect of sacroiliac joint with preservation of the joint space and sparing of the sacrum.
 
Associated with prominent paraglenoid sulcus attributed to resorption of bone as a response to stress.

May resolve spontaneously either partially or completely. If clinical findings are significant another source for symptoms must be found prior to attributing them to osteitis condensans ilii, which is usually an incidental finding. 

Pathophysiology is unclear believed secondary to stress across joint, possibly due to unstable pubic symphysis.  Although it occurs in men and women without children another theory believed OCI also to be due to increased vascularity during pregnancy.

Normal sacroiliac joint in 30 years of age 2-5mm wide.

The bilateral symmetric disease only affecting the iliac aspect without erosions, joint space narrowing, fusion, ligamentous ossification, or subchondral resorption.

Ddx
Inflammatory bowel disease: bilateral symmetric can not be distinguished from ankylosing spondylitis
Ankylosing spondylitis – M> F, bilateral symmetric, osseous erosions, joint space narrowing, ankylosis, sacral involvement, and ligament ossification.  
Hyperparathyroidism: bilateral symmetric, subchondral resorption of bone, joint space widening, sclerosis
Gouty arthritis: can be bilateral symmetric, large erosions, reactive sclerosis
Psoriatic arthritis, Reiters syndrome: variable can be bilateral and symmetric, erosions, sclerosis
Renal osteodystrophy
