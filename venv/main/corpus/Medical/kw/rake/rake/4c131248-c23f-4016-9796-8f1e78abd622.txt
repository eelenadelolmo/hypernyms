Pt was given IV antibiotics and subsequently scheduled for surgical resection.
Initial non-contrast chest CT found to have RLL consolidation.  Follow up contrast enhanced study revealed a multiloculted mass present posteriorly within the RLL.  Systemic arterial supply shown to be from the descending aorta with venous drainage into the R atrium.
Intralobar Pulmonary Sequestration
1. Intralobar pulmonary sequestration
2. Lobar consolidation/abscess
3. Pulmonary neoplasm
Female with recurrent episodes of pneumonia.
Initial non-contrast study showed apparent consolidation involving the posterior basal portion of the RLL.  Possible abscess or underlying mass also questioned, therefore follow up contrast enhanced study recommended.  This clearly revealed the presence of intralobar pulmonary sequestration, with systemic arterial supply and pulmonary venous drainage confirmed with reconstructions.
