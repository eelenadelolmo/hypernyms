Physical exam is remarkable for fine crackles over the left lower posterior hemithorax.
This patient’s radiograph returned to normal and his symptoms resolved after two months of treatment with oral corticosteroids.
“Garland’s triad” (“1-2-3” sign) of thoracic lymphadenopathy: There are bilateral hilar and right paratracheal opacities, the lobulated contours being typical of lymph node enlargement.

Note also the lymphadenopathy at the aorticopulmonary window region.

Also noted is a reticulonodular interstitial pattern at the lung bases, left greater than right.

Incidental findings include degenerative changes of the right shoulder joint, with calcification of the coracoclavicular ligament.
Stage II Sarcoidosis manifiesting with Garland’s triad, aorticopulmonary window lymphadenopathy and parenchymal disease at the lung bases.
Differential diagnostic considerations for bilateral hilar opacities include two major categories of pathology: (bilaterally) enlarged pulmonary arteries (pulmonary arterial hypertension [PAH]) and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. 

Pulmonary arterial hypertension may be divided into (1) cardiac causes including left-sided heart failure, mitral stenosis, left atrial myxoma, and cardiac shunts (VSD, ASD, PDA, truncus arteriosis, and transposition of the great vessels) and (2) pulmonary causes including emphysema; chronic interstitial lung disease, acute and chronic pulmonary emboli; portal hypertension; metastatic tumor emboli; and idiopathic (primary) pulmonary hypertension (plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy). 

The three major etiologies of bilateral hilar adenopathy are: 
(1) neoplasms including lymphoma, leukemia (CLL), metastases (e.g., renal cell carcinoma) and, rarely, primary bronchogenic carcinoma (usually unilateral or asymmetric); 
(2) inflammation including sarcoidosis or occupation lung diseases like silicosis, and 
(3) collagen-vascular diseases including lupus (rarely), polyarteritis nodosa, and mixed connective tissues diseases. Neoplastic and inflammatory diseases that more commonly present as unilateral hilar adenopathy include, in the neoplastic category, bronchogenic carcinoma, metastases, and lymphoma and, in the inflammatory category, tuberculosis, fungal infections (including Histoplasmosis, Coccidioidomycosis, and Blastomycosis), viral infections (including atypical measles), infectious mononucleosis, AIDS, drug reactions (e.g., phenytoin/Dilantin), and bilateral lung abscesses.

The radiographic manifestations of sarcoidosis are classified into three major stages as follows: 

Stage I: hilar or mediastinal adenopathy (or both) without associated parenchymal disease 

Stage II: concomitant lymphadenopathy AND parenchymal disease 

Stage III: diffuse parenchymal disease without associated lymphadenopathy 

Other stages sometimes mentioned include Stage 0 (normal chest radiograph) and Stage IV (pulmonary fibrosis). 

The staging system is important for two main reasons: it is a means of describing the radiographic findings (although patients do not necessarily progress sequentially from one stage to the next) and it has been shown to correlate with clinical outcome. In a survey of 3,676 patients with sarcoidosis from nine countries, 8% had Stage 0 disease, 51% had Stage I disease, 29% had Stage II disease, and 12% had Stage III disease and, on follow-up, 65% of patients with Stage I disease showed resolution of radiographic findings versus 49% of those with Stage II disease and 20% of those with Stage III disease. Sites of lymph node enlargement in decreasing order of frequency include the hilar, the right paratracheal region, the aortopulmonary window, the subcarinal space, the anterior mediastinum, and the posterior mediastinum. The “1-2-3” sign is a common radiographic finding in sarcoidosis and denotes the combination of bilateral hilar and right paratracheal lymph enlargement. The parenchymal abnormalities in sarcoidosis are usually bilateral and symmetrical and may have an upper lung zone predominance; the most frequent patterns are the nodular pattern and the reticulonodular pattern;, less frequently, a reticular pattern, air-space consolidation, or ground-glass opacities are the dominant roentgenographic finding.
