Hyperdense liver on a non-contrast chest CT.  Normal attenuation of the spleen and remainder of visualized organs.
Amiodarone deposition in the Liver
• Amiodarone use
• Primary hemochromatosis
• Wilson disease
• Gold treatments
• Thorotrast exposure
85 year old woman with dyspnea.
The chest Ct was requested in the patient to search for pulmonary findings of amiodarone toxicity,  The lungs, aside from mild emphysematous changes (not shown) were rather unremarkable.  The liver findings were incidental (but not unexpected).
