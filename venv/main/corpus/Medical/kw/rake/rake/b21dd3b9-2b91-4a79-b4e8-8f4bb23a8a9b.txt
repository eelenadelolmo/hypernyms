Normal PAP and pelvic exam.
Patient was refered back to clinician to be evaluated for endometrial biopsy
On transabdominal ultrasound imaging there was a normal homogeneous appearance to the uterus and endometrial stripe.  No endometrial fluid or focal areas of thickening.  EMS measured  1.8 mm consistent with endometrial atrophy.
    Endovaginal images again demonstrate normal, uniform thickness of the endometrial stripe without focal lesion.  EMS measured 1.9 mm.
    Hysterosonogram initially showed no focal lesion with instillation of the saline.  After balloon was deflated a small, well circumscribed mass was identified where the balloon was initially sitting.  This lesion is a homogeneous echogenic broad based thickening of the endometrial lining.  It measures 5.1 x 3.8 mm and demonstrates smoothly marginated borders without cystic components.  The cervical canal was normal in appearance.
Endometrial Atrophy with Polyp
DDX of Postmenopausal Bleeding:
1)   Endometrial Atrophy 
2)   Endometrial Polyp 
3)   Endometrial Carcinoma
4)   Endometrial Hyperplasia
5)   Submucosal Fibroid
64 y/o postmenopausal female with new onset of bleeding starting 2 months ago.  Not taking any medications currently.  Was on HRT for 3 yrs, but quit approximately 1 year ago.  No pertinent family history.
