Alert and Oriented X 3. Left homonymous hemianopsia with macular sparing, horizontal and vertical nystagmus, Normal DTRs bilat, severe upper extremity dysmetria on right, abnormal Romberg. Unable to do tandem gait, and bumps into objects on left.  LP: Positive 14-3-3 protein, increased protein, RBCs, and polysegs. Elevated AST/ALT. Elevated thyroid auto-antibodies
Pt was admitted to the neurology ward, and a full neurological work-up was started. Paraneoplastic/neoplastic etiologies were excluded due to rapid progression and as a result of test results. Pt’s mental status continued to decline, and he was started on high dose steroids course for possible Hashimoto’s encephalopathy, after labs showed increased auto-antibodies to the thyroid. Transitioned to Prednisone 80mg QD, and started on Serroquel and Geodon for agitation and sundowning.  Condition continued to worsen with difficulty protecting airway and he was intubated and transferred to MICU. Pt was placed on ventilator and found to have a retroperitoneal bleed. Pt had brain biopsy that confirmed CJD. After consultation with the family he was extubated and moved to a General Medicine ward. He expired the following week.
DWI Abnormalities in right occipital lobe/post temporal cortex w/o corresponding T2 changes.  

PET: abnormal hypometabolism R cerebrum and R cerebellum.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
Alzheimer disease, frontal and temporal dementia, HIV and HSV encephalitis, hydrocephalus, metabolic disorders, multi-infarct dementia, diffuse Lewey body disease, Hashimoto encephalopathy.
63 y/o male with history of NHL, and three weeks of decreasing visual acuity, gait ataxia, and poor coordination of left arm, that is worse in AM and improving during the course of day. New onset of personality changes and mood lability.
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) is a transmissible neurodegenerative spongiform encephalopathy, that is progressive and ultimately fatal, with no effective treatment at the present time. It is classified as a prion disease, which is an abnormal conformation of a host glycoprotein, that replicates in a self-perpetuating cycle of abnormal proteins and amyloid plaques. CJD has a long incubation period, with most cases presenting in the sixth or seventh decade of life. CJD has a mean onset of 62 years, with reports of cases ranging from 17 to 83 years of age. The incidence is approximately 1 case per million internationally and in the United States, with some Libyan Jewish populations and a few populations in rural areas of Slovakia, having 60-100 times this rate of familial CJD. 

There are three classifications of CJD: sporadic (spontaneous mutation), variant (infectious), and familial. Familial CJD accounts for about 10% of all cases, and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.  The mean duration after symptoms present is 8 months for the sporadic form, 16 months for variant, and 26 months for familial form. 

CJD is characterized by a rapidly progressive cognitive imparement, behavorial abnormalities, myoclonic jerks, higher cortical dysfunction and visual cortical abnormalities, cerebellar dysfunction, and pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. These signs and symptoms steadily increase, with death primarily occurring secondary to bronchopneumonia, due to overall disability and a bed-ridden state.

Testing for CJD is difficult at best, and in its early stages can present like many different disease processes, with a definitive diagnosis being accomplished only after a biopsy of brain tissue. Sixty percent of patients show characteristic EEG changes of periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWCs) on a slow and low-voltage background.  However, EEG has a low specificity and a sensitivity of only 50.0%. Testing for brain specific proteins such as the 14-3-3 protein and the neuron-specific enolase also supports a diagnoses of CJD, but even though they are more specific than EEG, they have a sensitivity of 84.0% and
73.3% respectfully.

PET scanning may show regional hypometabolism of glucose.

The most sensitive test to date is the MRI diffusion weighted images (DWI), which has a sensitivity and specificity of 92.3% and 93.8 respectfully. DWI is more sensitive than both T2I and FLAIR. DWI shows symmetrical high intensity lesions in the striatum (caudate and putamen), the dorsomedial thalamic nuclei, and cerebral cortical lesions. These findings were identifiable before PSWC’s on EEG , and before the final stages of the disease, which results in brain atrophy.  

Treatment at this time is symptomatic and palliative, but a number of experimental interventions are being tested, such as antimalarial quinacrine, chlorpromazine, and pentosan polysulphate, which prevent prion conversion and production, and an immunization that reduces the cerebral amyloid accumulation. 

Finally, as seen with this patient, CJD must always be in a differential for rapid dementia or for patients experiencing changes in mood, ataxia, and visual disturbances.

Today, we can only ease the suffering of CJD, but on the horizon a treatment may be near, and someday we can offer a real cure and a way to stop this deadly prion disease.
