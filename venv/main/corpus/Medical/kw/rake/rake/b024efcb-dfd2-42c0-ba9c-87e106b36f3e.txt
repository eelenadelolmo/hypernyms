Acute abdominal series suggestive of sigmoid volvulus.
Early fluoroscopic images demonstrate infusion of contrast material into the rectum, with an abrupt end to the contrast in a beak-shaped point.  Subsequent images demonstrate a small amount of contrast to pass into a bean-shaped loop of sigmoid colon, followed by unraveling of the sigmoid and free retrograde flow of contrast into the colon.
