No physical examination results were available.
No post-treatment images are available.
A miliary or micronodular pattern is seen throughout the lungs without focal mass. No lymphadenopathy is apparent.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Differential diagnosis includes silicosis, sarcoidosis, fungal diseases, tuberculosis, and hematogenous spread of metastases.
54 y/o female with report of abnormal chest radiograph at another institution. A prior routine chest radiograph from four years earlier was reportedly normal.
The widespread disseminated pattern suggests hematogenous spread of a primary lung adenocarcinoma (not detected radiographically) or of metastases from a distant adenocarcinoma.
