The patient can be treated with antibiotics and antisecretory agents (Proton Pump Inhibitors or H2 Blockers).  Endoscopy and biopsy could be performed to rule out a malignant ulcer if clinically concerned.  Endoscopy could also be done if there is concern about significant gastrointestinal bleeding.  A urea breath test and serum antibody test are less invasive studies that can be performed to confirm whether or not the patient is infected with H. pylori.  Patients with duodenal ulcers can be treated with antibiotics empirically since 90% to 100% of affected individuals have the H. pylori infection.
The en face fluoroscopic spot films demonstrate an ovoid collection of barium within the duodenal bulb with thickened mucosal folds radiating toward the ulcer crater.  The ulcer is present along the superior portion of the duodenal bulb.  In profile, the ulcer projects beyond the normal lumen of the duodenal bulb.

The patient presented complaining of a 1 month history of emesis after eating and epigastric pain occurring 20-30 minutes after eating.
Just as in this case, roughly 95% of duodenal ulcers are located in the duodenal bulb.  The remaining 5% of duodenal ulcers occur in the postbulbar duodenum.   Duodenal ulcers may involve any part of the duodenal bulb.  50% of duodenal bulb ulcers occur on the anterior wall.  This is different than gastric ulcers which rarely occur on the anterior wall of the stomach.  Because duodenal ulcers are often located on the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb, they are often best seen and diagnosed during the compression views obtained in an Upper GI study. Unlike gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers are virtually always benign. Postbulbar duodenal ulcers are the exception to this rule, and malignancy should always be excluded when they are discovered.  The ulcer in this case measured less than one centimeter in size which is typical for most duodenal ulcers.  Most duodenal ulcers appear radiographically as round or ovoid barium collections like the ulcer in this patient.  Only about 5% of duodenal ulcers have a linear configuration.  Linear ulcers are typically seen at the base of the duodenal bulb rather than at the apex as seen in this case.  Bulbar ulcers like the one presented also tend to be associated with radiating folds that converge centrally at the edge of the crater.  Other common features with duodenal ulcers include seeing a smooth radiolucent mound of edematous mucosa around the ulcer or noting a ring shadow of barium coating the rim of an unfilled ulcer crater.  Duodenal ulcers can also be associated with significant deformities in the duodenal bulb that result from edema, spasm, or scarring.  When significant bulbar deformity occurs from scarring, pseudodiverticula can form and balloon out between areas of fibrosis.  When multiple pseudodiverticula are present, they can cause the duodenal bulb to have a classic “cloverleaf” appearance.  Thickened folds, spasm, and deformity of the duodenal bulb are signs of peptic ulcer disease; however, visualization of a crater such as the one in this case is necessary to diagnose an active duodenal ulcer.  Complications from duodenal ulcers include obstruction, perforation, and hemorrhage.  Once the diagnosis of duodenal ulcer disease is established radiographically or by endoscopy, repeated attacks can be treated symptomatically.
