unremarkable.2.  There is increased radiotracer uptake within the vertebral body and left
posterior rib at T5.  There is also increased uptake in the L4 vertebral body
and including the pedicles at this level.  There is increased uptake with
mild expansion of the sacrum.  There is increased uptake and expansion of the
left iliac crest and into the pubic symphysis.  The remainder of the skeleton
is unremarkable.
Paget Disease of Bone
Paget’s disease
Primary bone tumor
Bony metastasis
Fibrous dysplasia
74 year old female with Paget’s disease.
Paget’s disease, also known as Osteitis deformans, is thought to be caused by a virus and may affect up to 3% of the population over four years of age.  It will demonstrate increased bone resorption and bone formation.  However, the newly formed bone will be abnormally soft.  During bone formation, the patient may have an increase in their alkaline phosphatase.  However, their calcium and phosphorus levels should remain normal.  During bone resorption, they may have an increased hydroxyproline level.  Paget’s disease typically involves the spine, pelvis, and proximal long bones.  It is divided into three phases: osteolytic phase, osteoblastic and mixed phases.  The initial osteolytic or the active phase is characterized by aggressive bone resorption and lytic lesions.  The osteoblastic phase or inactive phase is distinguished by abnormal bone production such as cortical thickening and bone widening.  Overall bone density is also increased at this phase. The mixed phase demonstrates bone resorption and formation and bowing of bones is prominent at this time. Bone scans are performed with Tc99m HDP which will show striking uptake during the osteoblastic phase and will typically show enlargement of the bone along with characteristic Paget’s disease bone deformities and expansion.
