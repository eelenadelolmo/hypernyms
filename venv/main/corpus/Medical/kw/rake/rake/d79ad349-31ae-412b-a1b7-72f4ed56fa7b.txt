Exam revealed a grossly swollen and contused left knee associated with medial joint line tenderness, pain with valgus stress, and a positive Lachman test.
Anterior-posterior radiograph of the left knee reveals a 5mm elliptical ossific fragment adjacent and distal to the lateral tibial cortex and plateau, respectively, consistent with a Segond fracture. The lateral radiograph shows increased density in the region of the suprapatellar bursa consistent with a knee effusion. 

Proton-density with fat saturation sagittal oblique MR image  of the left knee shows a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) at its proximal attachment and increased signal intensity in the normal location of the ligament consistent with post-traumatic change. The fibers that lie parallel with the tibial plateau are consistent with the torn ACL. High-signal-intensity bone contusions are present in the mid-lateral femoral condyle and posterolateral tibial plateau.
T2-weighted with fat sat coronal MR image shows both the ossific fragment adjacent and distal to the lateral tibial plateau and the and the femoral bone contusion. Both menisci, the collateral ligaments, and the posterior cruciate ligament were intact on other images not shown.
