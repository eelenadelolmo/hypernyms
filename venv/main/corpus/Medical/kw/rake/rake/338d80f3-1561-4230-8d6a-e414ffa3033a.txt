CT: Well circumscribed  cystic mass in the left upper abdominal quadrant, anterior and adjacent to pancreas

MRI: Confirms the cystic nature of mass
SUBDIAPHRAGMATIC (intraperitoneal) BRONCHOGENIC CYST
» Intraperitoneal origin:
  * Mesentric cyst 
  * Intraperitoneal bronchogenic cyst
  * Enteric duplication cyst
  * Lymphangioma

» Pancreatic origin:
  * Post inflammatory (Pseudocyst)
  * Cystic neoplasms (Microcystic or Macrocystic    
    adenomas)

» Adrenal origin:
  * epithelial cyst
  * post traumatic cyst

» Other:
  * Retroperitoneal bronchogenic cyst
37 y.o.woman presented to the ER with abdominal pain.
Intraoperatively the cystic mass was located near the celiac axis and lesser curvature of stomach.

Path description: GROSS DESCRIPTION:Received in one part labeled "Abdominal Mass."Received in formalin, the specimen consists of a 28 gm 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm tan-brown nodular/cystic soft tissue mass. Externally, areas of hemorrhage or excrescences are not identified. The external surface is inked black.	The cut surface is gelatinous, light tan to light brown, and homogeneous without areas of hemorrhage or necrosis. Otherwise, the specimen is well-defined and mildly encapsulated. Specimen submitted RPE four blocks,	regular.
