Negative physical exam and laboratory findings per ER note.
Surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiation
Complex Fourth intraventricular mass with both cystic and solid components.    This mass extends laterally into the foramen of Luschka.  There is peri-lesional edema in the cerebellum. There is enhancement of the central and peripheral aspects of the mass.

The lesion is causing obstructive hydrocephalus, enlarging all of the ventricles.
Ependymoma  WHO grade 2
Astrocytoma
Choroid Plexus Papilloma
Ependymoma
Subependymoma
Medulloblastoma (PNET)
19 y.o. woman, who was seen in the ER at least 6 times over a one month period for severe headaches.  On this, the seventh visit, would you get a scan?
Usually, spinal imaging MRI with gadolinum contrast is obtained for staging possible CSF spread ("drop metastasis").  In this case, the optic nerve (ON) sheaths and  their subarachnoid space appear enlarged/dilated - consistent with increased intracranial pressure.  

PMID: 18831721 "The best cut-off value to detect an ICP > 20 cm H2O based on a receiver operating characteristic curve was found to be ONSD = 5.82 mm with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 92%. A cut-off value of 5.30 mm yielded a sensitivity of 100%."
