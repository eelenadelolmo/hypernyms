VS:  AF BP 150/85 P 75 RR 20 SpO2 95% RA

PE:  Crackles bilateral lower lung fields, sever bilateral LE edema

Lower Extremity ultrasound:  Bilateral femoral veins compressible 

Transesophageal echocardiogram:  Stage I diastolic dysfunction
Anticoagulation +/- venous filter
Chest Radiography PA/LAT: Volume loss on right and patchy airspace opacity right lower lobe.  Blunding of right costophrenic angle consistent with effusion. 

CT, PE DVT Protocol:  Filling defect of right pulmonary/segmental artery.  Marked right sided pleural effusion.  Subcapsular hepatic hematoma.
Pulmonary Embolism
• Pulmonary Embolism
• Pleural Effusion
• Heart failure
84 year old woman who presents with sudden onset presents of EXERTIONAL DYSPNEA and SEVERE BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY EDEMA.  She is one week post gallstone pancreatitis with subsequent biliary catheter placement/open cholecystectomy.  She has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
Pt presented with signs/symptoms of pleural effusion versus pulmonary embolism.  In setting of normal lower extremity ultrasound and findings consistent with pleural effusion on chest radiograph, pulmonary embolism becomes easily overlooked/undiagnosed.  Subsequent findings on CT, revealed cocominant pulmonary embolus with concomitant pleural effusion.  Of note is also the fact that patient was anticoagulated for recent surgical procedure and sustained subsequent subcapsular hepatic hematoma making her likely candidate for venous filter.
