Obtunded - but with no focal neurological signs or symptoms
• Abnormal white matter signal intensity (T2W and FLAIR) in the posterior frontal and parietal lobes - vasogenic edema?
• No mass effect or hemorrhage. 
• No restricted diffusion.
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome
• Autoimmune vasculitis
• Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)
• Stroke
• Viral Encephalitis 
• Metastatic disease
49 year old woman, with Lupus, presents with a first time seizure.
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome has become a little bit of a misnomer, because the lesions are not limited to the posterior brain (occipital lobe) and the lesions are not always reversible. PMID: 17885064 

In the original reports, a unifying theme has been elevated blood pressure, and lack of other causes for the abnormalities. 

More recent reports have also implicated underlying autoimmune dysfunction of endothelial cells, causing a breakdown in the blood-brain-barrier.  PMID: 20435835
