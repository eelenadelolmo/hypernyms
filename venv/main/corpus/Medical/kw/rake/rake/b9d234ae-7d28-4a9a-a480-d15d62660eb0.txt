Texto: 
Normal neurologic examination with a tender swelling on the left parietal region of the skull.
No specific treatment is required when the fracture fragment does not extend deeper than the inner table of the skull (elevation of the depressed fragment may be required if the outer table of the fragment is below the adjacent inner table of the non-disrupted skull).  Follow up can be accomplished by non-contrast head CT to verify healing.
An irregularity in the skull is noted on the plain radiograph and is suspicious for fracture.  The axial image from a non-contrast head CT demonstrates a corresponding depressed skull fracture. A similar image obtained after six weeks demonstrates healing and remodeling of the depressed fragment.
Depressed skull fracture.
Depressed skull fracture
Non-accidental trauma
2 year old boy who fell down a flight of uncarpeted stairs and has a painful lump on the scalp.
This patient did well without treatment, and a follow up non-contrast head CT demonstrated healing and remodeling of the skull. The possibility of non-accidental trauma was also raised and the appropriate authorities were contacted to ensure that the child was not being harmed by caregivers.
