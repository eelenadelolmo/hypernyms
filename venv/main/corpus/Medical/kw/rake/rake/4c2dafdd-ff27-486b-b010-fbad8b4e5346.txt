Texto: 
The tumor was curretaged and the fracture site fixated with a sideplate and multiple screws, spanning the wrist joint.
There is an expansile lytic lesion within the distal radial metaphysis. This lesion extends to the subarticular aspect of the epiphysis. The physeal plate is closed, indicating skeletal maturity. The margins of the lesion maintain a narrow zone of transition without a sclerotic rim.  pathologic buckle fracture is seen extending through the lesion.
