Normal.
No treatment necessary.  This was the only abnormal finding noted on the prenatal ultrasound.
CHoroid plexus cysts measuring 4mm by 2mm.  No other abnormalities seen.
Choroid Plexus Cyst
Choroid plexus cyst.
28 year old G1P0 female presents for routine 2nd trimester fetal ultrasound at 19 weeks gestation.
Choroid plexus cysts are a common finding on prenatal ultrasound, seen in 1-2% of normal pregnancies.  There has been much debate in the recent literature as to the appropriate means of discussing or not discussing this finding with patients.  Currently, there is still evidence that there may be an increase risk of chromosomal abnormalities associated with this finding.  A recommendation from a retrospective study of >18000 patients with this abnormality found that in the absence of any additional abnormalities on the required anatomic screen images (based on joint ACOG, ACR and AIUM) with the addition of open hand images had a 0% incidence of chromosomal abnormalities.  As a result, when an isolated choroid plexus cyst is found, open hand images should be added to the anatomic screen.
