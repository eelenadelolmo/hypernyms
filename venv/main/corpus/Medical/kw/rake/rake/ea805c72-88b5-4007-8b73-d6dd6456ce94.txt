MR images of the brain demonstrate foci of increased signal intensity on long TR sequences within the left brachium pontis and deep white matter of the left cerebral hemisphere. The is also increased signal intensity within these regions on diffusion weighted images consistent with acute ischemia or acute demylenation. There is no evidence of disruption of the blood brain barrier on post-gadolinium T1-weighted images.
