Visual symptoms:
Decreased vision in his left eye to hand motions 
Normal vision, right eye

Ophthalmic examination:
Large yellow choroidal lesions and vitreous cells, left eye
Diagnostic vitrectomy performed on the left eye in September, 2003. Specimen sent for Laser Scanning Cytometry: 
 - “mixed population of T and B lymphocytes with a T:B cell ratio of 1:1”
 - equal populations of CD4+ and CD8+ cells
 - no expression of CD5 or CD10
 - “polyclonal expression of kappa and lambda…”
 - Cytologic preparation largely inadequate

December, 2003: Decreased vision in the right eye
Left eye was blind and painful leading to Enucleation of the left eye
• T2W MR shows bilateral frontal lobe involvement from a "butterfly" lesion in the genu of the corpus callosum

• Enucleated eye - after vitrectomy w/silicone oil replacement - shows thickening of the posterior retina w/small round blue cells
Retinal lymphoma, large B-cell type
• "Butterfly Lesions" - Astrocytoma, primary CNS lymphoma

• Retinal "blue cell tumor"
 - Retinal lymphoma
 - Retinoblastoma
 - Chronic (benign) choroidal inflammation

• Status-post vitrectomy
 - Intraocular silicone oil
 - Cataract
 - Angle closure glaucoma
62 y.o. man c/o progressive visual problem in his left eye
