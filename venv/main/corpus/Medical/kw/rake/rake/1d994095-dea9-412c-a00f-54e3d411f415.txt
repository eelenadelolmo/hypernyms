Texto: 
Tachypnea, tachycardia, low-grade fever.  Auscultation of lungs unremarkable.  Patient has right subclavian central line in place (not seen).
Patient anticoagulated uneventfully.
Multiple filling defects in right lower lobe segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries.  Multiple filling defects also seen in left lower segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries.  Deep venous thrombosis of the left lower extremity within the superficial femoral vein.
Pulmonary Embolism - Confirmed by illustrated study.
Pulmonary embolism with DVT.  The constellation of findings on CT examination is diagnostic.
37 year old male with history of HIV with acute onset of pleuritic left-sided discomfort.  Patient has a low-grade fever.
This patient had a central venous catheter in place at the time of diagnosis.  This is listed as a risk factor for PE.  This does not explain the DVT seen in the patient's leg, as the patient did not have a history of lower extremity surgery, recent immobilization, or a coagulopathy.
