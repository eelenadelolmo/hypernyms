PHYSICAL EXAM:	Bilateral malar "sooty" brown-black hyperpigmented patches. 
HISTOPATHOLOGY:	Marked swelling of collagen fibers with deposition of yellow-brown crescent-shaped pigment deposits. Some collagen fractured. Post-laser bx reveals some diminution in crystal size - no decrease in overall amount. No increase in macrophage number.
Alexandrite laser treatment x 2 with initial worsening felt secondary to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Lesions returned to their original state several months later. Essentially a treatment failure.
EXOGENOUS OCHRONOSIS (1997 Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, Case #30) presented by: Diane Touart, Maj, MC, USA
presented after an attempt to lighten his facial skin with an OTC bleaching cream purchased in Germany. Darkening of his cheeks occured after an unspecified duration of use, for which he sought medical help. He was prescribed hydroquinone for the darkening which caused worsening of the condition. The medication was discontinued shortly afterwards. (Specific time frames are difficult to elicit from pt).
