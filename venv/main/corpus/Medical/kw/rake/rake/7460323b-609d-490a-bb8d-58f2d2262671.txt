Texto: 
Subtle mass palpable at 3 o'clock. No nipple discharge or skin changes.
Excision. Confirms papilloma.  Atypical ductal hyperplasia is also noted.
Two very small and new clusters of microcalcifications was identified in the left upper outer breast and subareolar left breast on the screening mammogram and confirmed with magnification.  The calcifications are not easily seen, therefore the mammogram is not included for viewing.  The area of calcifications and palpable mass correlate.
Sonographic evaluation of the palpable mass reveals a well circumscribed round hypoechoic mass.  
Core needle biopsy was performed immediately.
Intraductal Papilloma of the Breast
Fibroadenoma
Breast neoplasm, no type is excluded
Papilloma
Subtle left upper outer quadrant mass palpated by the examining clinician at the annual physical.  The patient is otherwise asymptomatic with respect to the breasts.
Papilloma is usually excised since a papillary neoplasm cannot be excluded.  The distinction between benign papilloma and papillary carcinoma is often difficult for the pathologist.  Other new areas of calcification were identified in this patient, and although they may be related to fibrocystic change, treatment determinations are not straightforward. Since atypical ductal hyperplasia is noted in the excised specimen, follow up mammography is necessary to carefully assess the operative bed for absence of the calcifications which are held to be associated with this papilloma and to scrutnize the remainder of the breasts.  Atypical ductal hyperplasia is associated with a higher incidence of breast carcinoma.
Core bipsy is performed as an accurate and rapid means to confirm strong suspicions of either a benign or malignant mass. This minimally invasive procedure can provide the information necessary to avoid an "extra" excisional procedure.
