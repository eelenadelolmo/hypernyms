Chest CT showing round 2.5cm mass in the left lung (ddx: tumor, infiltrate, or abscess)
CT guided aspiration of abscess, IV antibiotics.
Corticosteroid: Controversial
MRI or CT to monitor if the abscess is drained and to monitor if abx is working.
• Non contrast CT of brain showed vasogenic edema in the left frontal and occipital lobes of the brain.
• Post contrast CT showed area with hypodense center with peripheral enhancement ring.
• MRI: T2 weighted image shows bright areas (as mentioned in the CT findings) indicative of edema around the abscess.
• T1 weighted image shows lesions.
• T1 weighted image post contrast shows enhanced rings representing capsules of abscess. 
• Diffusion Weighted Image shows bright area suggestive of restricted diffusion.
Brain Abscess (Gram positive Cocci)
• Tumor (metastasis)
• Abscess (Septic spread from lung?)
• Infectious process (e.g. toxoplasmosis, meningitis)
46 year old woman with mental status changes
The patient developed mental status change with lung involvement.
