Pes planus deformity
Conservative therapy with NSAIDS.
Calcaneocuboid coalition
Pes planus deformity
Enlarged Steida's process vs. partially fused os trigonum
Talonavicular osteoarthritis
Calcaneocuboid coalition
Congenital (can be familial, sometimes associated with other skeletal abnormalities)
Inflamatory(ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis) 
Iatrogenic
Long history of mild foot paint.
Regarding the ancillary findings on this study:

There is a groove on the posterior aspect of the talus for the tendon of flexor hallucis longus. Occasionally there is a process lateral to this groove known as Steida's process. An os trigonum is the accessory osicle that is present when this process is not fused to the talus.  The presence of an os trigonum or large Steida's process can lead to tarsal compression syndrome.

There is an association between tarsal coalitions and pes planus deformity.  The altered biomechanics related to tarsal coalitions leads to premature secondary osteoarthritis, as in this case.
