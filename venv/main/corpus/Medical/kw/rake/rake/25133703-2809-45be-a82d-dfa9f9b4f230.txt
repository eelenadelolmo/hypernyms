None for this sign of metastatic disease.
Uniformly dense (white) vertebra at T-7, with no abnormality of its contour or adjacent disks.
Ivory Vertebral Body
•Metastatic disease (osteoblastic)
•Paget disease 
•Lymphoma (usually Hodgkins)
63 y.o. woman with a history of breast cancer
There are numerous possible etiologies for the ivory vertebra sign.  Ivory vertebrae can represent osteoblastic metastatic disease, commonly stemming from breast cancer (as in this case), or carcinoma of the prostate.  This finding can also be associated with Paget disease, lymphoma, and less commonly with osteosarcoma and carcinoid.  This finding is much less common in children and usually related to Hodgkin’s lymphoma.  

Ivory vertebra appears as a  uniformly white vertebra with no abnormality of its contour or adjacent disks. The vertebra stands out against the adjacent normal, or darker, vertebral bodies. 

Osteoblastic metastases and lymphoma both result in the replacement of the vertebral body spongiosa with dense, confluent bony mass.  This produces a homogenous sclerotic appearance.  Paget disease often causes expansion of the vertebral body, disrupting the external contours.
