His temp on admission was 101.2F.

On PE, he had coarse breath sounds bilaterally with L>R and decreased breath sounds on the L.

CBC showed a WBC count of 37,000 with neutrophil predominance.
Treated with antibiotics and scheduled for follow up CXR in 4-6 weeks.
PA/Lateral of Chest showed a moderate sized left pleural effusion with evidence of left lower lobe consolidation obscuring the left hemidiaphragm, concerning for pneumonia.  

US of Chest showed a small left pleural effusion without evidence of loculation.
Left Lower Lobe Bacterial Pneumonia, Pleural Effusion
1) Pneumonia: most likely provided the clinical history and lack of cardiac/oncologic risk factors.  
2) Atelectasis: often interstitial pattern with linear strands or change in size of affected lung 
3) Effusion other than Parapneumonic: pleural effusions can arise due to numerous causes other than parapneumonic and can obscure healthy lung 
4) Pulmonary Edema 
5) TB: both TB and Pulmonary Edema may involve the interstitium and the alveoli concurrently 
6) Tumor: often involves atelectasis and pleural fluid.
2yo 9mo boy with a significant past medical history of asthma.  Presents now with a 1 week history of productive cough, shortness of air, fever, and oxygen desaturation to 85%.
This patient is classic for bacterial PNA with fever, SOA, productive cough, oxygen desaturation, elevated WBC, and positive cultures combined with the radiographic findings on CXR and confirmed non-loculated pleural effusion by US.
