Facial edema.
• inferior orbit fracture
• soft tissue swelling
• bleeding into maxillary sinus
Orbit "blow-out" fracture
Given the history, there is no other differential in this case.  The soft tissue swelling, fluid in the maxillary sinus, and trap-door appearance of the inferior orbital wall are the classic appearance of an inferior orbital wall blow out fracture.

Other etiologies of disruption of the inferior orbital wall would include neoplasm, resection, and aggressive infection.
51 y/o male with trauma to face.
