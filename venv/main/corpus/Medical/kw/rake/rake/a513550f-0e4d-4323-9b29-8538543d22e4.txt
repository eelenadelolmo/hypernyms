Nondisplaced fractures are usually treated with casting and non-weight bearing status.
Plain radiographs of the left knee demonstrate degenerative change with no acute fracture.

MRI of the left knee demonstates edema involving the medial tibial plateau with transverse low T1 signal line consistent with fracture.  No extension to the weight bearing articular surface.
