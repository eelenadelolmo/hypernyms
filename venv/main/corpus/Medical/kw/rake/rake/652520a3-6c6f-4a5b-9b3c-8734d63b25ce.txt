HCT: 32

Initial upper endoscopy:  negative
Colonoscopy:  negative
Endoscopy offers not only diagnostic ability, but also therapeutic options for upper GI bleeding.

ABC's and patient stabilization always first priority.  Endoscopic techniques include injection therapy, electrocoagulation, heat probes and laser Rx.
Interventionaly angiography could also benefit in difficult patients.  Surgery is last resort.

Additional medical Rx includes: H.pylori treatment (if +) and acid reducing medicines.
Nuclear medicine GI bleeding scan:  focus of increasing radiotracer activity at the duodenal region which conforms to bowel and moves antegrade.

Endoscopy:  duodenal ulcer
Duodenal ulcer
Differential diagnosis (based on Nuc Med RBC scan):
1)Peptic ulcer disease
2)Duodenitis-much less likely
3)Douodenal neoplasm-much less likely
47 y/o male with fatigue and weakness.
This case was unusual in that the initial upper endoscopy was negative.  Considerations thought to include: nonactive bleeding at time of endoscopy, redundant duodenal mucosal which obscured ulcer, or suboptimal evaluation of duodenal region.
