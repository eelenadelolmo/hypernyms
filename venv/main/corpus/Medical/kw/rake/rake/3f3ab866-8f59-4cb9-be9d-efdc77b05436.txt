Patient should have serial US exams and, poossibly, serial renal scintigrams, along with follow up labs as appropriate.  Surgical intervention is indicated if evidence of renal damage.
-Approximately symmetric differential renal function.
-Normal right kidney
-Preserved left renal function with evidence of pyelocaliectasis and delayed washout (i.e. excretion)
-Full-appearing urinary bladder
-Possible partially duplicated left renal collecting system
Probable partial left ureteropelvic junction obstruction
-Partial left UPJ obstruction
-Indeterminate T 1/2 of washout at least in part secondary to effect of full bladder and capacious collecting system (and possibly other factors as noted below in Discussion Section)
Intermittent left abdominal pain with pyliectasis on recent US.
Recommend repeating renal Lasix scintigraphy with Foley catheter in place, assurance of adequate hydration and adequate dosage of Lasix.  Would also consider imaging in the prone position if deemed necessary following standard supine position imaging
