PT/PTT/INR and Blood/platelet counts were normal.
Initial non-contrast head CT shows parenchymal hemorrhage within right temporal and parietal lobes, with subarachnoid blood.  Right transverse sinus appears hyperdense, as do visualized vein of Galen and straight sinus.  MRV images show flow void at right transverse sinus, later confirmed with angiography.
Right Transverse Sinus Thrombosis
Hemorrhage in a young adult can be caused by AVM, hemorrhagic primary or metastatic neoplasm, auto-immune disease, or even hypertension.  The findings of acute occlusion of venous sinus is more narrow, though infiltrating neoplasm would remain in differential along with clot.
Patient with acute onset of headache and visual disturbances approximately three weeks after beginning oral contraceptives to help control dysfunctional uterine bleeding secondary to fibroids.
