Diffuse RLE weakness with spasticity noted in both arms and legs (R>L). Additionally, 7-8 beats of sustained clonus on RLE ankle jerk and mildly ataxic gait secondary to instability.
C3-C4 Laminectomy with subsequent physical and occupational therapy
• MR Brain - Sagittal T1 image w/o contrast demonstrates normal brain parenchyma with apparent tapering of the spinal cord at the C3-C4 level.
• MR c-spine - Sagittal T2 FRFSE image w/o contrast demonstrates diffuse disk desiccation at all levels with posterior projecting disk material at C3-C4 level causing cord impingement and severe central canal narrowing.
• MR c-spine - Axial T2 FRFSE image w/o contrast at the C3-C4 level demonstrates posterior disk bulge, eccentric to the right with superimposed uncovertebral spurring causing mass impression and effacement of the ventral thecal sac and cord, resulting in severe central canal stenosis.
Spinal stenosis
• Disk Herniation w/mass effect
Prior to imaging, considerations also included transverse myelitis, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and peripheral nerve trauma.
57 year old man with 4 weeks of gradually progressive right lower extremity weakness and gait instability, now acutely worsening.
