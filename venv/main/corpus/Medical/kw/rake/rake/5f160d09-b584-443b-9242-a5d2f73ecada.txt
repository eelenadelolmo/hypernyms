Ca 12.8 (8.4-10.2), PTH 151 (15-65), 24-Hour Urinary Calcium 422 (100-300), Normal TSH, Normal Free T4
Surgery pending.
Hypoechoic, homogenous, solid mass. Hypervascular (this can be difficult to detect), posterior to the thyroid and medial to the carotid.
Parathyroid Adenoma
Parathyroid adenoma, parathyroid cancer, Thyroid nodule
Noticed a palpable neck nodule.
Somewhat atypical to present with a palpable nodule, usually the hyperparathyroidism is found incidentally on routine labs.
