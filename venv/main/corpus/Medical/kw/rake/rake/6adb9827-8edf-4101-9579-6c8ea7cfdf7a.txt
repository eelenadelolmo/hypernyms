Slight decreased hearing in right ear
No cutaneous stigmata of NF
No cerebellar signs
Complete resection.  Radiation and chemotheraphy pending.
Extraaxial enhancing mass containing multiple small cysts occupying the right CPA cistern and extending into the right jugular foramen and IAC.  
No hemorrhage in mass.
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST)
• Meningioma
• Vestibular Schwannoma
• Glomus Jugulare tumor
21 year old previously healthy woman presented to outside hospital because of three weeks of headache and vomiting.
PMH/FMH No history of any familial disorders, including NF.
Primary MPNST are uncommon - and even more so intracranially - except when they arise outside the skull and track retrograde.
