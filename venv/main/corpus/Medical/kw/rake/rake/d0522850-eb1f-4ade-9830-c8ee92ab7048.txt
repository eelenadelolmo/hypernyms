Same as above.
Unenhanced CT images show a region of low density in the inferior right lentiform nucleus.  More superiorly, the right lentiform nucleus is diffusely low in attenuation, demonstrating the so-called disapearing basal ganglia sign.  MRI shows increased intensity on FLAIR and T2 sequences with diffusion restriction, consistent with acute infarct.

56 year old male with acute onset of unilateral motor symptoms.
