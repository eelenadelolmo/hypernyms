CC: I can’t see on my right side and have been bumping into things for the last 1.5 years. 

Referred by optometry for a “visual field defect” and optic nerve abnormality not noted prior

Septo-Optic Dysplasia,(de Morsier syndrome),Radiographic Features:
Disorder of midline prosencephalic cleavage
Incomplete development  (or absence) of the  septum pellucidum
Uni/bilateral Optic nerve, chiasm, optic tract dysplasia
+/- Malformation of the corpus callosum and fornix, large chiasmatic cistern, schizencephaly

*******When characteristic facial dysmorphism, open anterior fontanel, and other features are present along with septo-optic dysplasia, the term De Morsier syndrome is used, although in common parlance this term is used interchangably with septo-optic dysplasia, whether or not other features are present.



Clinical Features:
Pendular nystagmus
Visual disturbance
Mental retardation 
Hemiparesis (especially if associated with schizencephaly)
Quadriparesis
Hypopituitarism in 15-60% 

Triad of a small anterior pituitary gland, an attenuated pituitary stalk, and an ectopic posterior pituitary enhancement (“bright spot”) on MRI 
Endocrine defects range from panhypopituitarism to isolated deficiencies of ACTH, GH, TSH, ADH or gonadotropins (delayed puberty)
May have isolated hyperprolactinemia or precocious puberty 
Neonatal hypoglycemia and seizures are important presenting signs in affected infants

****Evaluation of the hypothalamic–pituitary axis—pot’l life-threatening in infancy****
Elevation of prolactin with lack of hypothalamic inhibition
Precocious puberty with imbalance of pituitary precursor cells


Etiology: 
Sporadic
Mutation in the HESX1 homeobox gene
Young maternal age
Pregnancy risk factors:
Diabetes
Anticonvulsants
Phencyclidine
Cocaine 
Alcohol
