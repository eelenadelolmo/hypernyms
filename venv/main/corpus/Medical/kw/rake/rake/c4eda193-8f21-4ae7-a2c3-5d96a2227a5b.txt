Multiple lesions involving both white matter and cortex involving both cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum.
No mass effect nor enhancement nor restricted diffusion.
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)
• Cerebral infarction
• Lymphoma
• Metastatic disease
• PRES
33 year old man with end stage renal disease.
