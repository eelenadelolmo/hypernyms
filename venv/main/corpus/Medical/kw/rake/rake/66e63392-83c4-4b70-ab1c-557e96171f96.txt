Obtunded 
No focal signs or symptoms
Patient's mental status improved on antifungal medications.
• High signal T1 lesions in the perivascular spaces bilateral basal ganglia
• Lesions enhance following contrast administration
• Minimal mass effect
Cryptococcus, Cryptococcoma (presumed)
• Cryptococcus meningitis
• Toxoplasmosis
• Hemorrhage
• Metastatic disease
39 year old woman s/p bone marrow transplant therapy for leukemia.  Decrease in mental status prompted MRI.
In spite of brain biopsy and multiple CSF and blood samples Cryptococcus could not be confirmed.  The cause of the high signal intensity lesions in the VR spaces is likely to be due to proteinaceous fluid in the pseuocapsule of the offending organism - since neither calcium nor blood was demonstrated in these regions on a contemporary CT scan.
