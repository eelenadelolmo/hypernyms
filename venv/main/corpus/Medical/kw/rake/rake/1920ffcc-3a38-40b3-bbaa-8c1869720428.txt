Texto: 
General:  appropriate for gestational age, term newborn that is alert and active and in no distress.
HEENT: Nondysmorphic.  The anterior fontanelle is soft and flat. Palate is intact.  Nares patent.  Ears are normally positioned.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation with no grunting, flaring, or retraction.  Breath sounds equal.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without a murmur.  Pulses are intact peripherally.
Abdomen:  Without hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.  There is some fullness on the left side with deep palpation, in comparison to the right side, but no discernible obvious mass is felt.  
GU:  Consistent with a full-term, circumcised male with bilaterally descended testes.
Rectal:  Anus is normally positioned.
Back:  Spine is intact.
Extremities:  Nondysmorphic.
Skin: Anicteric.
Neurologic:  The infant moves all extremities, has positive suck and Moro reflexes and has a normal tone for 38 weeks.
The mass was surgically resected and was found to be intraperitoneal in the left upper quadrant with no connection the tracheobronchial tree with a vascular pedicle coursing through the left hemidiaphragm.  Following surgery, no follow up was necessary. 

Pathology:  a roughly pyramidal specimen covered by uniform, smooth and glistening, red surface 3.7 cm x 2.6 cm x 1.7 cm.  Sectioning of the specimen reveals a red uniform surface.  Sections show pulmonary tissue characterized by abundant cavities lined by bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium, thick interstitium, and no cartilage.
Plain Radiograph: no abnormality detected.

Ultrasound:
Findings:  There is a mass adjacent to the upper pole of the left kidney that is compatible with an adrenal mass. This measures approximately 3 cm in its greatest diameter. It is mostly echogenic but there are several areas that are sonolucent that may represent cysts or necrosis.  Doppler examination shows the presence of blood flow. Both kidneys are identified in the normal fossae. 

CT:
There is a triangular low attenuation mass lateral to the mid polar region of the left kidney. This lesion is best seen on the delayed images. It fails to enhance postcontrast.  It measures 2.2 x 1.4 x 2.9 cm.
Subdiaphragmatic Extralobar Pulmonary Sequestration
Neuroblastoma, Subdiaphragmatic Extralobar Pulmonary Sequestration, Teratoma, Adrenal Hemorrhage, Bronchogenic Cysts, and Intestinal Duplication Cysts
A 38-week term male with a left-sided peri-adrenal mass was discovered at 32 weeks gestation and was stable over multiple ultrasounds. After delivery, the infant appeared normal and did not require any resuscitation.
