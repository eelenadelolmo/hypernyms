Focal EEG with left hemispheric slowing.
Neurology consult.
Broad strip of soft tissue which follows gray matter on all pulse sequences, extending off the left anterior ventricle and into the high left frontal gray matter.  Focal thickening of the cortical gray matter and volume loss is associated.
Heterotopic gray matter
Heterotopia
Neoplasm
54yo female with life long history of epilepsy and seizures.
Secondary to premature arrest of neuronal migration from the germinal matrix to the cortex, islands of gray matter are disorganized within white matter, causing clinical symptoms such as siezures, weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, and/or developmental delay.  Heterotopias are classically divided into two main types: Band and nodular.  Nodular types tend to be associated with less morbidity, while Band types show severe developmental delay with an earlier onset of seizures.  This process is best described on MRI where soft tissue that follows gray matter on all sequences is found within in the deep white matter.
