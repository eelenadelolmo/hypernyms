Recurrent Shoulder Dislocation/Instability
22 year-old man presenting to acute care with pain in left shoulder after reaching out to catch a football.  He reports a history of 6 prior 'shoulder separations.'
The patient not only has an acute dislocation, but prior glenoid labrum repair is evidence of recurrent dislocations (instability).  The reported mechanism of injury also suggests instability.  The patient was referred to Orthopedics for further care and has not received additional imaging within our system.
