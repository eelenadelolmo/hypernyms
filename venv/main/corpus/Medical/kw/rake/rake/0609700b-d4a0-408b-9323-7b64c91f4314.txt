Unknown
Patient is asymptomatic and does not require follow up.
>>Triple Phase hepatic CT Scan demonstrated early homogeneous contrast enhancement of mass. Howver centripetal filling was not completed during the delayed imaging. Consequently, the patient was referred for nuclear medicine tagged-RBC for further evaluation.

>> Nuclear medicine tagged-RBC scan demonstrated RBC localization to lesion and persistence of activity within the lesion on delayed SPECT imaging compatible with a hemangioma.
Liver Hemangioma
Hepatoma 
Focal nodular hyperplasia
Hepatic Adenoma
Hypervascular metastases 
Hepatic Hemangioma
50 yo male with incidental finding of liver mass during recent laparascopic cholecystectomy.
Pt then referred for further diagnostic imaging evaluation.
While CT Scan is a good diagnostic imaging modality for liver lesions (e.g. diagnosis of hemangioma with over 80% specificity and sensitivity), it can be equivocal, parfticularly if the lesion is large with central thrombus which will not opacify after intravenous contrast administration. 
Nuclear medicine technetium-99m tagged Red Blood Cell Scan demonstrated RBC activity within the lesion on tomographic SPECT images and proved the diagnosis of hemangioma thus excluding the need for further diagnostic query.
