Bladder prolapse on physical examination. Rectal tone normal. Laboratory values non-contributory.
Spot lateral images of the rectum obtained at rest following administration of barium paste demonstrated an anorectal angle of 132 degrees and anal canal length of 18 mm and an anorectal junction level of 9 mm inferior to the ischium.
 
Images obtained during contracture of the pelvic floor muscles (the lift)demonstrated an appropriate decrease in anorectal angle magnitude to 123 degrees and an appropriate rise in the anorectal junction level to a location of approximately 5 mm inferior to the ischium.  The anal canal length was without significant interval change.
 
Spot images obtained during coughing demonstrate no evidence of stress fecal incontinence.
 
Spot images obtained of the patient straining demonstrated an appropriate decrease in the anorectal angle magnitude to 121 degrees.  Also noted is
shortening of the anal canal length to approximately 16 mm.  The anorectal junction level also dropped appropriately to a level approximately 10 mm
inferior to the ischium.
 
Images obtained during defecation demonstrate adequate evacuation of the rectal contents without evidence of rectal prolapse.  An approximately 1 cm outpouching from the posterior rectal wall is noted with straining
consistent with a rectocele. Post defecation images obtained during straining demonstrate a large
enterocele.
