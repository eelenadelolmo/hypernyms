No focal neurological findings
Surgical resection without recurrence  at 2 years.
• CSF signal intensity mass on spin echo scans in the prepontine cistern and extending into the ambient cistern on right.

• Mass demonstrates restricted diffusion (high signal on ADC) and does not suppress on FLAIR imaging.
Epidermoid (inclusion cyst)
• Arachnoid Cyst
• Epidermoid or Dermoid tumor (inclusion cyst)
