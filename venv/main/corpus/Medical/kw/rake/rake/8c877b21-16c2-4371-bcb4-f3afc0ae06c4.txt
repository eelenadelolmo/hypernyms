30 y/o woman with Marfan's syndrome, pre-op aortic valve replacement.
Patients with cardiac complications secondary to Marfan's syndrome have a much shorter life expectancy (mean age at death is 28 years).   Collagenous and mucoid material accumulations, especially in the proximal aorta, and fragmentation of elastic fibers result in aortic dissection and rupture.   Cystic medial necrosis causes similar changes, seen most frequently in the ascending aorta.  Incompetence of the aortic valve frequently results and leads to valvular insufficiency, as in this case, where replacement was necessary.
