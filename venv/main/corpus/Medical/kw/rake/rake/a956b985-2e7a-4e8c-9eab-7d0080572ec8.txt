Unremarkable. Pain with movement at the hips.
Pending surgery for bilateral total hip arthroplasty.
Severe superolateral joint space narrowing with sclerosis, osteophyte formation, and the presence of large subchondral cysts.  Normal mineralization, no fractures or erosions.
Osteoarthritis Hip - Radiographic
Osteoarthritits, due to:
-Crystal Deposition Disease (CPPD) - diagnosis suggested if have findings of chondrocalcinosis and axial pattern of joint narrowing.
-Remote Trauma
-Acromegaly
-Developmental or Epiphyseal Dysplasia can result in early-onset OA
-Hemophilia / chronic hemarthrosis with secondary OA
Bilateral Hip Pain
Patient has classic imaging features of hip arthritis.  Bilateral, somewhat assymetric distribution is characteristic.  Bilaterality makes a sequalae of trauma less likely.  No discernable chondrocalcinosis or erosion to suggest CPPD, alkaptonuria or gout.  No acetabular architectual distortion to suggest DDH. Pt is not a hemophiliac or on coumadin.
