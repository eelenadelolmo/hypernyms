Sagital T1W image right of midline shows thin CSF filled, gray matter lined cleft extending from the lateral ventricle to the cortical surface.  Additionally, T1W and T2W axial images show heterotpic gray matter (without appreciable CSF cleft) extending radially from the left lateral ventricle to the brain surface.
Schizencephaly
Open and closed lip schizencephaly
Nonspecific neuronal migration disorder/gray matter heterotopia
2 year old with seizures and developmental delay.
CSF cleft on the right demonstrates open lip schizencephaly.  Heterotopic gray matter on the left with absence of appreciable CSF cleft demonstrates closed lip schizencephaly.
