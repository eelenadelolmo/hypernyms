Texto: 
Acute abdominal pain and increased girth. Palpation demonstrated an acute abdomen with a paucity of bowel gas and tympany suggestive of free air.
Immediate surgery and diverting colostomy.
Axial non-contrast CT images through the lower pelvis and site of anastamosis demonstrate a large amount of intraperitoneal free air. At the site of anastamosis, there appears to be discontinuation of the lumen of the bowel. Following the administration of rectal contrast demonstrate a large amount of contrast extravasating from the previous identified dehiscence at the site of anastamosis.
Pneumoperitoneum secondary to failure of surgical anastomosis.
Perforated Viscus:
-appendicitis, 
-diverticulitis or 
-ulcer
