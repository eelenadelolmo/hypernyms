Left sensorineural hearing loss.
Patient underwent resection of the left CPA epidermoid mass.  Serial MRI Brain exams performed to follow up.
With respect to CSF on T1 and T2WI, there is a hyperintense mass in the left cerebellopontine angle. This mass measured 4.1 cm transverse x 2.6 AP x 3.7 cm superior/inferior.
Epidermoid Brain Tumor
Arachnoid cyst vs. epidermoid
48 y/o male who presented for MRI IAC after being diagnosed with left sided sensorineural hearing loss.
For this patient, the epidermoid caused mass effect on the pons and insinuated itself between some of the crainal nerves.  This likely played a role in the  patient's sensorineural hearing loss.  

Arachnoid cysts tend to follow CSF imaging characteristics very closely whereas epidermoids can be more heterogenous.  Epidermoids, as well as arachnoid cysts occur commonly in the CPA. 

Patients with CPA epidermoid inclusion cysts often present with facial pain, rather than hearing loss.
