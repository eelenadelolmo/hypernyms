Nystagmus 
Normal growth and development
None
Dysgenesis of the corpus callosum with absence of the septum pellucidium.
Posterior body and splenium of the corpus callosum are intact.
Dysgenesis of the corpus callosum
Holoprosencephaly
Septo-optic dysplasia
11 month old male with nystagmus
Callsoal abnormalities:
Agenesis: Complete absence of the corpus callosum
Partial agenesis or hypoplasia: The corpus forms in a front to back pattern.  With partial agenesis the front aspects of the corpus (genu and anterior body) are formed
Dysgenesis: An abnormality in development typically seen in holoprosencephaly.  This case does not appear to be a holoprosencephlay in that there is a normal interhemispheric fissure, and there are 2 anterior cerebral arteries (as opposed to the azygous ACA seen in holoprosencephaly). Most likely this case represents an intrauterine event that affected the anterior fibers crossing.
