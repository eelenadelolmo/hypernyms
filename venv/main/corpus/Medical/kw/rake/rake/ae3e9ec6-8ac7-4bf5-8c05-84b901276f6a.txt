Texto: 
Mild swelling, tender to palpation anteriorly and laterally.  Limited range of motion; able to bear weight.
Initial conservative management with rest and NSAIDS.
Axial and coronal T2 weighted fatsat and a sagital GRE images of the left knee demonstrated diffused increased bright signal throughout the patella and lateral aspect of the lateral femoral condyle.  The is increased bright signal and irregularity to the cartilage of the medial patellar facet and trochlea. There is a small effusion; medial and lateral retinculum are intact.
Traumatic Transient Lateral Patellar Dislocation.
1. Traumatic transient lateral dislocation of the patella.
35 year old active duty male with recent history of "hyperstension injury" to left knee while b playing basketball.
The imaging findings are specific for this type of injury.  The patient did not report a patella dislocation, however, the report of hyperextension was likely the transient patellar dislocation.  The chondral injury to the patella and trochlea also support such an injury, although some degree of chondromalcia may have exsisted beforehand.  The medial and lateral patellar retinculums remained intact.  No other ligamantous or meniscal injuries were identified.
