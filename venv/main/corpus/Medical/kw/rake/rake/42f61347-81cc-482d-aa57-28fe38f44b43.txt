Clinical examination reveals left sensorineural hearing loss.
The patient is referred to ENT consultation.
?ultiplanar and multi-sequence MR imaging demonstrates the presence of a small enhancing mass inside the left internal auditory canal. The mass remains intracanalicular without causing any expansion of the left internal auditory canal. Given the clinical history , the above findings are more consistent with vestibular schwannoma.
Vestibular schwannoma
Vestibular Schwannoma (8th)
Facial Schwannoma (7th)
Meningioma
Epidermoid cyst
Arachnoid cyst
Metastasis
Aneurysm
65 year old man presents with progressive left-sided hearing loss, tinnitus, and disequilibrium.
Careful observation of the contents of the internal auditory canal is required whenever the clinical history includes unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Vestibular schwannoma either intracanalicular or intracanalicular with CPA (cerebellopontine angle) extension is the most common lesion in patients with SNHL (>90%).
