Vital signs stable.
General – Alert & oriented. Not in acute distress
HEENT – Atraumatic, normocephalic. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular muscle intact. Moist mucous membranes. Poor dentition. Spider hemangioma on right cheek. No other rash.
Neck – supple with no lymphadenopathy.
CV – RRR with normal S1, S2.
Pulm – CTAB with no wheezes, rales, rhonchi
Abd – soft, nontender, nondistended. No fluid shift or caput medusa. No organomegaly felt.
Extremities – Bilateral lower extremity edema with compression stockings in place. No evidence of asterixis.
Labs – Sodium 141, Potassium 3.9, Chloride 106, Bicarbonate 26, BUN 12, Creatinine 0.85, Glucose 74, WBC 5.9, Hgb 14.9, Hct 42.3, Platelets 99000, INR 1.25, ALT 26, AST 49, Total Bilirubin 0.6, Alk phos 179, Albumin 3.9
MELD score = 9
Child-Pugh Score = 5-6 (Grade A)
No immediate treatment required. Enroll for liver transplant.
Nov Arteral phase CT – Nodular liver surface contour and enlarged caudate & left lobes. Small hyperintense lesion in segment 7 of liver, too small to characterize.

Feb NonContrast CT– Nodular liver surface contour and enlarged caudate & left lobes. No lesion seen in liver.

Feb Arterial phase CT – Nodular liver surface contour and enlarged caudate & left lobes. Linear hypervascular focus within segment 7 of the liver most consistent with transient vascular shunt. 

Feb Venous phase CT – Nodular liver surface contour and enlarged caudate & left lobes. Small linear hyperintense lesion washed out in venous phase – likely transient vascular shunt

Feb Venous phase CT varices – Nodular liver surface contour and enlarged caudate & left lobes. Multiple varices seen, consistent with history of portal hypertension.
Cirrhosis
• Liver cirrhosis
53 y.o. man with alcoholic liver disease complicated by trace non-bleeding esophageal varices, thrombocytopenia, and hepatic encephalopathy. 

PMH: HTN, COPD, Biliary sludge, sinus surgery, shoulder surgery

Social history: Drinks 4-6 beers/day since age 21. Quit drinking at the time of diagnosis in April 2010. 27pack-year smoking history. No history of IV drug use.
Patient’s LFT is consistent with that of alcoholic hepatitis. His slightly elevatd INR may be indicative of decreasing liver synthetic function. In addition, nonbleeding varices documented from prior endoscopy and imaging are evidence of portal hypertension. Although his ESLD is relatively mild with low MELD score (9) and Child-Pugh Score (Grade A), the history of encephalopathy and suspicion for hepatocellular carcinoma prompted pretransplant evaluation. He has been sober for more than 6 months, making him an eligible candidate.
