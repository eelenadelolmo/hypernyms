No palpable masses on breast exam.  Evidence of prior surgery (scar) present on physical exam.
Left mastectomy. Patient is not elligible for radiation therapy because of prior radiation to this breast.
Bilateral mediolateral oblique (MLO) and craniocaudal (CC) views of the breasts as well as spot magnification images of the upper outer quadrant of the left breast (in MLO and CC projections) are shown.  Within the upper outer quadrant of the left breast, in a segmental distribution, there are multiple punctate calcifications of varying size and shape, consistent with pleomorphic calcification.  These calcifications were shown to have increased in number as compared to the patient’s mammogram performed one year prior to the current study.  In a patient with a history of left breast cancer, lumpectomy, and radiation, these increasing pleomorphic microcalcifications prompted further evaluation with stereotactic core needle biopsy.

Specimen radiograph from a stereotactic core biopsy of the upper outer quadrant of the left breast reveals calcifications within several of the core samples.  In total, calcifications were present in five of seven core samples.  Pathology revealed ductal carcinoma in situ, high grade.
Increasing calcifications in a patient with a history of grade I invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast
Key to differential diagnosis of segmentally distributed pleomorphic microcalcifications in a patient with a history of breast cancer:  recurrent cancer must be the diagnosis of exclusion and biopsy is recommended.

DCIS
Invasive ductal carcinoma
ADH
Severe FCC change/sclerosing adenosis
Fat necrosis
The patient is a 51 year-old female with a history of left breast infiltrating ductal carcinoma in 1996 (Grade I), now status post left lumpectomy and radiation, axillary node dissection, and bilateral subpectoral saline implants.
