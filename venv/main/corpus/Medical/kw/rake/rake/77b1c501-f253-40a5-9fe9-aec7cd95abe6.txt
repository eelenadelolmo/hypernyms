Biliary diversion and stenting.
Ultrasound

Trace perihepatic fluid and fluid in the gallbladder fossa not unexpected for postoperative patient.
No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Normal portal and hepatic flow. 

CT

Ascites and free pelvic fluid with mild stranding within the mesentery.

Scintigraphic

No gallbladder was visualized consistent with the patient's prior cholecystectomy.
 
10 minutes following radiotracer injection, an abnormal blush of radiotracer was demonstrated in the region of the gallbladder fossa and along the left paracolic gutter.
Coalescence of additional abnormal radiotracer activity within the pelvis persisted on delayed upright images of the abdomen and pelvis.
