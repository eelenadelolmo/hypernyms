Decreased breath sounds and hyperinflation. Pneumothorax on chest radiograph necessitating chest tube placement.
Annual evaluation.
CT demonstrates multiple thin-walled cysts of various sized surrounded by normal lung parenchyma. The bronchovascular bundles are at the periphery of the cyst walls which is distinct from typical centrilobular emphysema.

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare disorder with no known cause. Often it is associated with tuberous sclerosis. It typically affects women age 15 though 50 years of age, almost exclusively in women of childbearing age. It is exacerbated by pregnancy and oral contraceptives.

Proliferation of smooth muscle obstructs bronchioles which cause trapping of air, hyperinflation, and formation of cysts and ultimately pneumothorax. There is also associated obstruction of veins causing pulmonary edema and hemorrhage and lymphatics causing recurrent chylothorax.

Classic signs are coarse reticular interstitioal pattern caused by summation of multiple cyst walls, recurrent chylothorax and pneumothorax, and increased lung volumes. CT demonstrates multiple thin-walled cysts of various sized surrounded by normal lung parenchyma. The bronchovascular bundles are at the periphery of the cyst walls which is distinct from typical centrilobular emphysema.
