Gamma Knife Radiation
• Enlarged optic nerve/nerve sheath complex on left.
• Enhancement of optic nerve sheath best seen on fat suppressed images--"Tram Track" sign
• Loss of CSF signal in nerve sheath due compression by tumor
• Loss of target sign on coronal T2 sequences through orbit due to compression of nerve and increased T2 signal of nerve.

49 year old woman with progressive loss of vision in the left eye
Th MR diagnosis  of optic nerve sheath meningioma requires post contrast T1 images with fat suppression.  Without these images contrast enhancement of the optic nerve sheath tumor is obscured by adjacent orbital fat.
