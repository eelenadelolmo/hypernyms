CT guided drain placed. Treatment was per infectious disease recommendations and included ertapenium therapy.
Right subdiaphragmatic fluid collection measuring 11 by 7 cm, with irregular borders and peripheral enhancement.  This appears to extend superiorly into the right lung base at the region of the bare area of the liver.  Extensive consolidation of the right lower lobe and right middle lobe with small right effusion.  Left lower lobe consolidation and effusion.  Small pericardial effusion.
Subdiaphragmatic Abscess
necrotic tumor, loculated ascities, pleural effusion.
Remote gastric bipass
2 mo prior completion gastric resection
1 mo prior ex-lap peritonitis 1 L pus
Currently off antibiotics with hypotension, mental status changes, fever, elevated WBC
The patient's cultures demonstrated Fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella buccae, pantoea agglomerans, and prevotella melaninogenica.  These cultures are consistent with bacterial peritonitis with subsequent abscess formation. 

The right subdiaphragmatic space has access from the right pericolic gutter and subhepatic recess.  Most common causes of abscess in this region are from appendicitis, perforated viscus, gallbladder or ulcer.
