Vital Signs: Pulse is 86, respiratory rate 20, pulse oximetry 96% on RA, temperature 37.2  Blood pressure 128/78
Lungs:  Lungs showed good excursion. There were no rales, rhonchi, or wheezing. There was no egophony or fremitus.  
Heart:  Heart was in a regular rhythm and rate without murmur, gallop, or rub.
Abdomen:  Abdomen was soft, nontender with hyperactive bowel sounds.  No masses or hernias were noted. There was no tenderness.
Rectal:  A rectal examination was not performed at the request of the patient.  There was mucous stool present.
Pelvic:  Pelvic examination was not performed at the request of the patient.
Admitted to the floor
NPO, TPN/IV hydration
Metronidazole IV
Vancomycin PO

Follow-up as needed post discharge
There is marked colonic wall thickening and mucosal enhancement extending from the distal transverse colon through the rectum.  There is a large amount of pericolonic stranding as well as a small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.  There is no pneumatosis or portal venous gas.  No pneumoperitoneum. There are multiple non-dilated, fluid-filled loops of small bowel seen throughout the abdomen.

The celiac trunk, SMA and IMA are patent.  The splenic vein, portal vein and SMA are also well visualized and patent.
C. difficile colitis
• Infectious colitis
• Ischemic colitis
• Ulcerative colitis
• Crohn’s colitis
72 yo woman with 1 month history of abdominal pain and watery diarrhea, which has been getting gradually worse.  No hematochezia. Patient was recently admitted and treated for a multifocal pneumonia 1 month ago.  She presents today with fatigue, dehydration and continued diarrhea.
Patient developed gradually worsening abdominal pain and watery diarrhea soon after she was treated with cefuroxime and azithromycin for mutifocal pneumonia.  On abdominal/pelvic CT scan with IV contrast,  there was marked colonic wall thickening and mucosal enhancement extending from the distal transverse colon through the rectum.  There was a large amount of pericolonic stranding as well as a small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.  The celiac trunk, SMA and IMA were patent.  Patient’s history and imaging findings were highly indicative for  C. difficile colitis.  This was confirmed by C. difficle toxin assay from the stool culture.
