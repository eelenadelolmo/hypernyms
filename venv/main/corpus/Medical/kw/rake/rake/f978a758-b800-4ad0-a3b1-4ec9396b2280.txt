Physical Exam: Bilateral hip pain upon standing and walking. Pt is TTP along hip joints bilaterally. Pt has longstanding pain with worsening in his hip pain recently.
Treatment options for avascular necrosis of the femoral heads include conservative management, total hip replacement, core decomprssion with or without bone grafting and osteotomy.  

This patient received a total right hip arthroplasty with potential replacement of left hip in future.
Frontal and frog leg films of both hip joints revealed extensive degenerative changes on the bilateral femoral heads and acetabula. Acetabula demonstrate sclerosis and associated osteophyte and subchondral cyst formation. The bilateral femoral heads demonstrate extensive osteoarthritic changes with sclerosis, cyst formation, bilateral ring osteophytes and some mild flattening of the femoral heads. 

Coronal T1 and T2 MRI: T1 and T2 MRI revealed extensive degenerative changes on the bilateral femoral heads and acetabula. There is high signal intensity degenerative edema of the femoral heads on T2. Superior acetabula demonstrate low signal intensity on T1 and associated osteophyte and subchondral cyst formation. The bilateral femoral heads demonstrate extensive osteoarthritic changes with sclerosis, cyst formation, bilateral ring osteophytes and some mild flattening of the femoral heads. There are small areas of abnormal signal to suggest avascular necrosis.
Avascular Necrosis of femoral heads bilaterally with associated osteoarthritic changes.
Secondary Osteoarthritis from avascular necrosis
Primary Osteoarthritis
Patient is a 49 year old African American male with a history of sarcoidosis, sinusitis with intermittent steroid treatment that presents with several years of bilateral hip pain.
AVN most often occurs during the fourth or fifth decade of life and is bilateral in 55% of cases.  The etiology for AVN of the femoral heads is vast and includes trauma, hemoglobinopathies, Caisson disease, local infiltrative diseases such as Gaucher disease, hypercortisolism, alcohol, pancreatitis, renal failure, cigarteet smoking, collagen vascular diseasese, congenital diseases such as SCFE and Legg-CalveP-Perthe, Fabry, giant cell arteritis, gout, hemodialysis, HLD, hyperparathyroidism, pregnancy, SLE, and idiopathic. The most common cause of bilateral AVN is steroid use, even for short periods. Our patient had a history of stage I sarcoid disease that was untreated.  The etiology of this patient's bilateral AVN of the femoral head is unclear.  There is no case report of a link between sarcoid and AVN. The patient did however have chronic recurrent bouts of sinusitis that required steroids.  He received both fluticasone and oral prednisone for short periods during these recurrent attacks of sinusitis.  This appears to be one possible etiology of his AVN.
