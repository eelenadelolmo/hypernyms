The physical examination noted a joint effusion.
Isolated partial tears require surgery.  If the ACL is involved, surgery is also required with correction of the PCL first, and then the ACL at a later time in order to fix posterolateral instability.  Complete PCL tears are treated conservatively with knee immobilization, crutches, ice, elevation and orthopedic referral.  After 1-2 weeks, the patient should begin isometric quadriceps exercises.
MR images of the left knee demonstrate a large joint effusion.  Heterogeneous high signal is seen within the posterior cruciate ligament, consistent with a complete tear.  There is a significant degree of bone marrow edema within the anterior lateral tibial plateau, and an occult tibial plateau fracture cannot be completely excluded.   Additionally, there is abnormal vertical high signal within the medical meniscus, consistent with a free edge traumatic tear.  The lateral meniscus is normal.  The medial and lateral collateral ligament complexes are normal.  The anterior cruciate ligament is also normal.
Isolated Posterior Cruciate Ligament Tear
A mid-substance interstitial lesion (most common).
Complete disruption at the genu
Avulsion at the tibial attachment (least common).  
	- this requires reduction of osseus fragments to increase the chance of healing.
Patient is status post motor vehicle injury.  He complains of difficulty walking and knee pain.
-Etiology and Pathogenesis:  Classically a “dashboard injury” causes this where there is a direct blow to the tibia while the knee is in flexion with a posterior backwards flexion.  However, rarely is there an isolated PCL tear as usually the ACL or MCL is involved.  


-Epidemiology: Rare, as only 30% of tears to the PCL are isolated.

-Clinical Manifestations: Pain, pop, buckling sound.  Pain is greater with a complete tear than with a partial tear.  Pain increases with going down stairs or with pushing off in running.
