Coarse breath sounds, intermittent crackles
He improved with antimicrobial therapy.
Chest CT reveals patchy ground-glass attenuation throughout the lungs; right pleural fluid vs. thickening is noted (he has had prior right hemothorax); rim-calcified lesions are noted in the anterior mediastinum.
Pneumocystis Jiroveci Pneumonia / Calcified thymic cysts in AIDS
Lungs:
  Noncardiogenic Pulmonary edema (he is ESRD and HDD)
  Pneumonia (PJP, other fungal or bacterial)
Mediastinum:
  Calcified thymic cysts (can be seen with HIV)
  Egg-shell calcified lymph nodes (silicosis, sarcoid)
  Prior infections (TB, HIV, Parasites)
  Aneurysms
  Tumor (germ cell neoplasm, treated metastasis,
    treated Hodgkins with XRT)
37yo male with history of hemophilia who acquired HIV and Hepatitis C virus years prior which resulted in HIV nephropathy, subsequent renal failure, and AIDS.  He presents with worsening shortness of breath.
His egg-shell calcified anterior mediastinal lesions appear to have resulted from HIV; surgical resection has not been attempted.
