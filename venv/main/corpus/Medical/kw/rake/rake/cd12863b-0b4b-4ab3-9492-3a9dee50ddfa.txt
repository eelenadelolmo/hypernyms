Laboratory data noncontributory.
Surgical resection, found to have ruptured at surgery.  Followed by chemotherapy.
Initial KUB film read as normal by resident on call, subsequently called abnormal, suspicious for intussusception by staff the following morning.

Ultrasound examination followed and showed a 13cm pelvic mass, no intussusception.

CT scan followed which showed large pelvic mass, felt to be most likely ovarian.  Small amount of free fluid in the abdomen. Breast buds were also noted.
Granulosa Cell Tumor, confirmed by pathological evaluation.
Ovarian tumor, most likely hormonally active.  Granulosa cell tumor, teratoma, sertoli-leydig, or epithelial tumor.
