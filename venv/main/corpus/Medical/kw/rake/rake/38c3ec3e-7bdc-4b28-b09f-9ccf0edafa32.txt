Occipital mass
surgical resection of mass
Midline occipitals mass which communicates with intracranial space
Mass with minor soft tissue contents but contains mostly CSF.
Superior sagittal sinus is not drawn into the sac, and there is a persistant falcine sinus
Occipital cephalocele
Cephalocele
 -Meningoencephalocele
 -Menigocele
 -Atretic encephalocele
 -Gliocele
 
Dermoid
Sinus pericranii
Hemangioma
Cephalohematoma
New born male with occipital mass noted in multiple prenatal ultrsound studies
Close attention should be paid to the dural venous sinsuses.  There location in relation to the cephalocele is important for the surgeon to be aware of.  Anomalies of the dural venous sinuses may be seen.  In this case there is a persistent falcine sinus, and a question of a fenestration within the sagittal sinus at the level of the cephalocele.
