None needed in this case.  In cases that are equivocal, follow up or even biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
AP and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate an opacity within the right lower lobe at the posterior costophrenic angle that appears somewhat mass-like and a chest CT was recommended.

Axial chest CT images following intravenous contrast administration (in both soft tissue and lung windows) demonstrate a focal area of pleural thickening with moderate sized adjacent linear parenchymal opacification and a drawing in of the bronchovascular bundles toward to pleural thickening in a comet tail pattern.  There is also some associated volume loss within the right lower lobe.
