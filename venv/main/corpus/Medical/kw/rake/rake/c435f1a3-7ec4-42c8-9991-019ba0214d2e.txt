The middle facet of the talocalcaneal joint is
irregular and sclerotic, with a narrowed joint space bridged by a T1- and T2-dark band.  This is consistent with a fibrocartilaginous coalition. Mildly increased T2 signal consistent with edema is present in the talar component of the middle facet.
Talocalcaneal coalition
23 yo woman with a history of chronic right foot pain.  Physical exam (per history) reveals decreased inversion/eversion and pain in the region of the sustentaculum tali.
