None, as it is a normal variant.
Incidentally noted is a normal variant cavum 
septum pellucidum and vergae in an otherwise unremarkable CT of the head.
Cavum septum pellucidum and vergae.
-cavum velum interpositum 
-symmetric midline brain cyst
Pt imaged for recurrent, worsening headaches of sudden onset, and not responsive to medications.  No history of head trauma or loss of conciousness.
It is unlikely that there is any relationship between the patient's headaches and this incidental CT finding.
