Osteomas are benign lesions that are usually treated conservatively.
Large ossific density within the right frontal sinus.  This is associated with mucosal thickening and thickening of the frontal sinus bones.
Osteoid osteoma, frontal sinus
• sinus osteoid osteoma
• inspissated mucous with calcifications
• encrusted foreign body
47 year old male with complaint of chronic sinus headaches over many years.
Osteomas are usually located in the frontal sinus and can be a source for recurrent headache.  Classic presentation is frontal sinus pain associated with changes in air pressure (such as experienced in diving or on aircraft takeoff and landing).  Occasionally these lesions can be associated with mucocele formation and pneumocephalus if the posterior wall of the frontal sinus is breached.
