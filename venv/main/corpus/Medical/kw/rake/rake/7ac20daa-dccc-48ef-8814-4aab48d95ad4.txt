Texto: 
Last recorded physical exam at 5 months of age demonstrated hypotonia without a specific neurologic defect.  No physical examination at time of imaging.
The case was referred back to the patient’s neurologist. Follow-up is pending at this time. The published literature indicates that these white matter changes are transient and reversible, with no permanent structural damage, so alteration of the treatment plan may not be necessary.  http://www.sabril.net/InfantSideEffects.aspx
