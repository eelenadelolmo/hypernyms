Follow up on complicated cysts is best performed at 6 weeks following the original finding to ensure the patient is at a different phase of the menstrual cycle.

Often BCPs can be perscribed in order to regulate the ovulation cycle and decrease the likelihood of functional or hemorrhagic cysts on followup
-Complex cystic mass with low level internal echoes.
7.8 cm in greatest diameter

-“Fishnet weave” pattern of internal echoes.

-Fine interdigitating septations.

-No color Doppler signal
Hemmorrhagic Cyst
Ddx for a complex or large adnexal lesion:

1.  Hemmorrhagic ovarian cyst
2.  Endometrioma
3.  Ectopic pregnancy ( +hcg, no intrauterine pregnancy)
4.  Ovarian tumors
     epithelial tumors - cystadenoma, cystadenocarcinoma
     germ cell tumor - teratomas or "dermoids"
5.  Abscess
      Tubo ovarian abscess secondary to PID
      Appendicitis
      Divertticulitis
6.  Hydrosalpinx/pyosalpinx (PID)
G4, P313 with documented right ovarian cyst from outside hospital measuring 6 x 5 cm admitted with persistent worsening pain.
Hemorrhagic cysts are included in the differential diagnosis for a complex cyst which includes: functioning and nonfunctioning hemorrhagic cyst, endometrioma, dermoid, torsion, abscess, pyo/hydrosalpix, and cystic neoplasms (both benign and malignant).

All cystic lesions should be evaluted for malignant features such as wall thickness, inner wall structure, septa and echogenicity.  

Hemorrhagic cysts are variable in presentation but findings which favor this diagnosis is absence of internal flow, good through transmission, and reticular fishnet weave pattern.  If sonographic findings are not strongly favorable for malignancy, follow-up in 1-2 menstrual cycles is indicated as most hemorrhagic cysts resolve in this time period.
