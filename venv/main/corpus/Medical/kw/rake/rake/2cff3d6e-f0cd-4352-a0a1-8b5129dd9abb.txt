Admission Cr of 1.4
---------------------
Discharge Cr of 0.7
The patient was hydrated until her creatinine normalized.
Contrast retained within both kidneys.

Resolution of renal contrast retention.
Persistent Nephrogram due to dehydration.
• Contrast induced Nephropathy
• Dehydration
• Obstruction (vein or ureter)
70 y.o. woman with abdominal pain.  She had an abdominal CT with IV and oral contrast at an outside institution, about 14 hours earlier.
There are many causes of persistent nephrograms. However, usually due to acute renal failure.  The following is a brief summary of the major catergories of acute renal disease.

Pre-renal
Hypotension
Dehydration
Decreased overall perfusion

Intrarenal
ATN
Acute glomerulonephritis
Renal artery thrombosis
Contrast Reaction/Toxic

Post-renal
Obstruction
-Ureteral stones
-Nephrolithiasis
BPH
Infection
Neurogenic bladder
