7 x 5cm soft, somewhat fixed right neck mass.  
2cm left neck internal jugular chain nontender node.
Thyroid unremarkable.
Thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection.  Followed byt I-131 treatment.  Follow up I-131 study demonstrated a focus of accumulation in the left neck.  Follow up CT demonstrated major resolution, but residual mass and lymph node involvement in the left.  Subsequent treatment with Iodine is ongoing.
Chest Xray:  Soft Tissue density in the right neck.

Neck CT: 
-bilateral markedly contrast enhancing cystic 
to heterogeneous pathologic lymphadenopathy 
-extensive punctate to flocculent nodal calcification 
-encasement of the right internal jugular vein. 
-benign appearing thyroid with a poorly marginated 4 mm diameter nodule along the superior anterior right lobe
Papillary Carcinoma of the Thyroid
