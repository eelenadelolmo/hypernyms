Gravid patient with tenderness and swelling of her left lower extremity.
Lovenox (Low molecular weight heparin)
(Coumadin is a class C drug and is contraindicated in pregnancy.)
The transverse sonographic image demonstrates noncompressibility of the popliteal vein due to occusive thrombus.  The longitudinal sonographic images demonstrate a hyperechoic thrombus within the lumen of the vessel.
Deep venous thrombosis
DDX of physical findings:
•Deep venous thrombosis
•Ruptured Baker's cyst
•Cellulitis 
•Chronic venous insufficiency 
•Extrinsic venous compression 
•Superficial thrombophlebitis 
•Hematoma
34 yo gravida 1 para 0 female at 25 weeks with 1 day history of left lower extremity pain and swelling.
This patient was at increased risk for DVT due to her pregnancy.  Ultrasound, the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing DVT, is especially appropriate during pregnancy because of its does not use ionizing radiation for image generation.
