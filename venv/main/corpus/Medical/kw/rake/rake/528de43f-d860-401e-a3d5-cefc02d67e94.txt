Texto: 
The abdomnen is soft, but the bladder is palpable and distended.  The penis, scrotum, and testicles are es are normal.  

Micturition is atypical with urine dribbling instead of steaming from the urethral meatus.

BUN 9  
Cr 0.07
The consulting urologist performed posterior valve ablation.
VCUG of the bladder demonstrates a trabeculated bladder wall with the presence of small left sided Hutch diverticulum.  Grade V reflux of the left collecting system is seen.  The insertion of the ureter into the bladder is associated with the diverticulum.  There is dilitation of the proximal urethra.  A posterior urethral valve identified.  No right vesicureteral reflux was noted at the time of the examination.

Ultrasound remarkable for bilateral normal size kidneys with poor corticomedullary differentiation, bilateral renal cysts consistent with bilateral renal dysgenesis.  Bilateral severe hydroureteronephrosis.  Thicken wall bladder consistent with trabeculated bladder suggestive of posterior urethral valves.
Congenital Obstructive Posterior Urethral Membrane (Posterior Urethral Valve) with Grade V left Ureter reflux and right secondary ureterovesical junction obstruction.
Vesicoureteral Reflux
Ureteropelvic Junction obstruction
Obstructed upper pole of duplex collecting system 
Posterior Urethral Valves
Ureterovesical Junction Obstruction
Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney
Ureterocele
Ectopic Ureter
Urethral Atresia
Newborn Male status post induced vaginal delivery for anhydramnios at 35 weeks 5 days gestation.  Antenatal ultrasound at 20 weeks and subsequent antenatal ultrasound were both remarkable for bilateral hydronephorsis and persistently low amnionotic fluid index.
This case is typical.
