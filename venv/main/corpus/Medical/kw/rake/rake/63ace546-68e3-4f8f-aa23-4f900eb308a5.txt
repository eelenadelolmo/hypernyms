Positive pregnancy test
The left ovary has a cystic structure in the parenchyma of the ovary that has peripheral hypervascularity.  Adjacent to the left ovary is a soft tissue echogenicity mass.  The uterus is empty with a small amount of free fluid present.
Ectopic pregnancy.
32 year old female presents to the emergency room with pelvic pain and bleeding.
While the "ring of fire" is discussed as a discriptor for an ectopic pregnancy, often the corpus luteum in the ovary adjacent to the ectopic has a much more impressive peripheral hypervascularity.  The ectopic in this case is the smaller echogenic soft tissue mass medial to the left ovary.
