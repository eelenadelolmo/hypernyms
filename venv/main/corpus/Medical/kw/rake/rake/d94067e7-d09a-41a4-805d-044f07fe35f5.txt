Intubated ICU patient.
The ICU team was notified of this finding and a right-sided chest tube was placed.  The patient continued to receive daily portable chest radiographs for evaluation of her cardiopulmonary status and resolution of pneumothorax.
Daily portable chest radiographs were being ordered for this patient, as is common for intubated and/or ICU patients.  Multiple EKG wires are seen overlying the patient.  In addition, a right subclavian central venous catheter and a left peripherally inserted central catheter are seen with their tips appropriately positioned in the superior vena cava.  An orogastric tube is seen to course inferiorly across the left hemidiaphragm and off the plane of the image.  An endotracheal tube is positioned just below the clavicles.  Unknown tubing is seen to coil either in the upper airway or is overlying the patient.

The right hemidiaphragm is blunted with the suggestion of  a small layering pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal in size and contour.  However, the right heart border appears too well outlined by lucent lung.  Lung markings are still visible adjacent to the right heart.  However, note the asymmetry between the left and right heart borders with the right heart border being much more sharply seen.
Pneumothorax
Pneumothorax
Normal lung
Patient is status post partial colectomy for colon cancer, which was diagnosed in 1995, with a subsequent recurrence in 1998.   Patient was admitted several weeks prior to this image for worsening metastatic disease and respiratory status.
Positive pressure ventilation, as well as, central line placement are risk factors for pneumothorax.  Many ICU patients will have both of these risk factors and therefore, part of the rational for obtaining daily radiographs in ICU patients is to evaluate for this complication.   In addition, the usual presenting symptoms for pneumothorax are chest pain and dyspnea; symptoms which may be difficult to assess in an intubated and sedated patient.  Upright chest films are more sensitive for detecting small pneumotharaxes, and  will be demonstrated as an apical visceral line with an absence of lung markings beyond it.  However, in most ICU patients chest radiographs are obtained with the patient supine.  Air within the pleural space will not rise to the apices in this case, but instead will be seen as increased or asymmetrical lucency within the lung.  Pneumothoraxes in this instance can be subtle and difficult to detect.  In fact, one-third of pneumothoraxes may be inapparent on supine films.
