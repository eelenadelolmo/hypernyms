Visibly enlarged supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
Left-sided subcutaneous chest port.
Replacement of subcutaneous central venous access device.
Scout image of his chest port and catheter demonstrate normal appearing port and catheter with venous access of the left axillary vein.

Fluoroscopic images following contrast injection through the port demonstrate extravasation of the contrast material into the soft tissues of the left chest and shoulder.
Catheter fracture with leakage
Catheter fracture with leakage
History of ALL refractory to multiple chemotherapy regimens.
Patient complains that for the last several months, he has experienced increasing pain in his left shoulder with his chemotherapy infusions through his left-sided subcutaneous chest port which was placed at an outside institution.  The pain is self-resolved several minutes after the infusion is completed.
Complications associated with indwelling central venous access devices are relatively common (see factoid).  This particular complication is not common, however.  The extravasation of contrast material and the patient's complaints are virtually diagnostic of a catheter fracture with leakage of infusion material at the location indicated by the arrows on the images.  This complication is more common in cases where the subclavian vein is accessed due to the catheters course trough the soft tissues before entering the lumen of the vein.  In particular, passage through the subclavian musculature can create a relatively fixed region of catheter that will eventually weaken with repetitive arm motion.
