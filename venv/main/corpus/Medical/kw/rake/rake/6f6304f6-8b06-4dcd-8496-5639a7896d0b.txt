Dependent on stage, but pre- and postoperative chemotherapy and sometimes radiation for local recurrence.
Image 1: Fat-saturated Coronal T2 MRI of the abdomen / spine demonstrates a large mass over the right kidney.  There is also increase T2 signal in several vertebral bodies.  Increased T2 signal is present in both iliac wings, and some expansile remodeling is seen in the left iliac wing.

Image 2: Fat-saturated Sagital T2 MRI of the spine shows a soft-tissue appearing mass that has invaded and insinuated itself within the epidural space - compressing the spinal cord.
Neuroblastoma with intraspinal extension
If intraspinal extension were the only manifestation and the lesion were sharply marginated, spherical, or fusiform, then more benign nerve root tumors such as neurofibroma or schwannoma would be considered.  Ganglioneuroma and ganglioneuroblastoma are also possible.

However, given the large adrenal mass and the bone metastases, neuroblastoma becomes the primary consideration.
One-year-old boy was walking, but now only crawls.
This case of neuroblastoma with spinal invasion is especially intriguing in the that the mass has compressed the spinal cord to the extent that the infant who once walked will only now crawl.  This was in fact what brought the child to medical attention.
