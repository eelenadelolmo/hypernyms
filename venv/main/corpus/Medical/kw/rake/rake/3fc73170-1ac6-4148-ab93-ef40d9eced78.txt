Texto: 
elevated WBC
positive urine cultures
Long term Abx via PICC
US - hyperechoic wedge shaped defect of the left upper pole that shows decreased perfusion on doppler imaging.

DMSA - decreased radiotracer accumulation of the left upper pole
Acute pyelonephritis
pyelonephritis
cortical infarct
5 week old male with urinary tract infection
Excellent correlation between scintigraphy (DMSA renal scan) and sonography; it is relatively uncommon to see focal parenchymal abnormalities on renal ultrasound in acute pyelonephritis.
