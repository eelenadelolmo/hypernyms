Subtle lucency in proximal left femur which was not appreciated on initial plain film. Bone scan and PET imaging shows increased metabolic activity in bone turnover within the proximal left femur.  MR imaging showed an isointense lesion filling the medullary cavity, slight thinning the cortex.
Renal Cell Carcinoma lytic bone metastases.
Metastases, myeloma, infection or some other primary bone neoplasm.
