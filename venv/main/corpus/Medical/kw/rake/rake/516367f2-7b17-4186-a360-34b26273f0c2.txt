No focal neurological deficit.  No abnormal labs.
Surgical excision.
• CT:  Hyperdense round area adjacent to posterior falx on right.  On bone window settings, some calcifications are seen within the mass.  
• MR:  Avid enhancement of extraxial mass.  On T2 images there is a CSF cleft sign, suggesting extraxial location aas well as compression of sulci.  A dural tail is also seen.
• MRV:  No venous or sinus occlusion.
Meningioma
• Meningioma
• Dural sarcoid
• Dural metastasis
• Hemangiopericytoma

Being extra-axial, with avid enhancement, including a dural tail and associated calcification - Meningioma is most likely.
52 year-old woman with headaches and some dizziness.
