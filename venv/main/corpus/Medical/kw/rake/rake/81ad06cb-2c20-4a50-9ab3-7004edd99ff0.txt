On T2WI there is an alternating pattern of cortical intermediate signal (normal cortex), subcortical low signal intensity (normal white matter), second deep layer of intermediate signal (heterotopic gray matter, double cortex), and low signal deep white matter (normal).

On T1WI the signal of white matter is normally brighter than gray matter but all layers, including the double cortex, are again identified.
Band Heterotopia
• Laminar heterotopia
• Band Heterotopia
• Nodular Heterotopia
Three year old girl with developmental delay and increased frquency of seizures.
