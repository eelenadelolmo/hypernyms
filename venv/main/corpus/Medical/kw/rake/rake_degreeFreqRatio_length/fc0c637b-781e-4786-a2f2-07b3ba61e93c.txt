1) Find primary malignancy and tailor therapy to cell type.
Partially occluded right IJ is imaged to best advantage LONG and with color flow once it is identified posterior to large jugular lymph node compressing it. The node in TRANSVERSE plane may be mistaken for right IJ as it has the appearance and configuration of a venous structure relative to the more medial carotid.
DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS?
1) Occlusive venous thrombosis
2) Echoic artifact in vein giving the appearance of thrombotic disease
3) Lymph node
4) Soft tissue mass of the neck
