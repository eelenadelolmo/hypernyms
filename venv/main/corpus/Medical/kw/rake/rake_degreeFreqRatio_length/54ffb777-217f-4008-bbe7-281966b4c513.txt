Patient refused further treatment and was dispositioned to hospice/palliative care.
CT:  Biliary stent in place.  Heterogeneous pancreatic head mass.  Liver demonstrates peripherally enhancing hypodense lesions compatible with metastatic disease.  Intraluminal filling defect within the portal vein and superior mesenteric vein.  Fat stranding of the mesentery with thickening of the intraluminal folds of small bowel.
Mesenteric ischemia secondary to superior mesenteric vein thrombosis that extends into the portal vein.
58 year old with metastatic pancreatic cancer and biliary stent placement with fever and RUQ pain.
This patient had extensive metastatic disease with superior mesenteric as well as intrahepatic portal venous thrombosis.  Malignancy predisposes to hypercoagulability, leading to thromboembolic disease.  

Acute presentations include symptoms for less than 4 weeks.  Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, and pain out of proportion to physical exam.

Radiographic findings are nonspecific and include ileus with non-dilated loops of fluid filled bowel.  Late stage disease manifests as thumbprinting (mural thickening from submucosal hemorrhage), mesenteric thickening, pneumatosis, and mesenteric or portal venous gas.  The most common finding is bowel wall thickening which this patient manifested.

A triad of low attenuation of the superior mesenteric vein, bowel wall thickening, and ascites is strongly suspicious for mesenteric infarction.
