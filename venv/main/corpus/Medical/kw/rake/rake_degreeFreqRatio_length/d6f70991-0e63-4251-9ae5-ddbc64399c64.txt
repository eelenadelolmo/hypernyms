large right face mass
Treatment for this recurrence will first involve external beam radiation.  After this, embolisation may be tried with or without subsequent surgical excision.
A large right nasopharyngeal mass has recurred in a benign, expansile remodeling format - disrupting the pterygoid plate from the sphenoid bone.  This tumor is highly vascular, demonstrating marked enhancement at CT and MR, with flow voids on MR, and a characteristic dense tumor stain at angiography.
Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (JNA)
Diagnosis confirmed at histology after first resection.

Sarcoma
Meningioma
This young Pacific Island teenager presents with a recurrent right face mass.
This boy's JNA recurred after excision.  Its impressive size now requires the stepwise treatment described above.
