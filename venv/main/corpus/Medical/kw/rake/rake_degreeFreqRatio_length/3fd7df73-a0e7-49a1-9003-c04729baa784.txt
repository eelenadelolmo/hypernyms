ABD: obese, soft, TTP suprapubic area, ND, BS present, no peritoneal signs
SKIN: 4cm R groin hematoma, several areas of resolving hematomas on abdomen, large hematoma on L flank
H/H: initially 13/38, POD#1 7.8/22.7
POD#2 CT cystogram (not shown) showed the fluid collection increased to 16cm x 16cm x 18cm, with no contrast extravasation from the bladder. H/H continued to drop, taken to OR where a defect in the R femoral vein was repaired. Post-op, BP responded to IVF and blood transfusions
Fluid seen around R common femoral vein and artery that is moving posterior to rectus abdominis muscles, ending in a large fluid collection anterior to the bladder.  Well-circumscribed 10.5cm x 7.5cm x 9.5cm fluid collection within the Space of Retzius
Extravasation of blood from R common femoral artery and vein.
Hematoma, Urine, Abscess
58yo F, PMH significant for DVTx3 on coumadin therapy at home, currently on Lovenox window, POD #1 s/p normal cardiac catheterization, continued hypotension s/p cath, had an episode of lightheadedness with fall.
Bleeding s/p cardiac catheterization has been reported in the range of 2-14%, retroperitoneal bleeding reported in 0.12-0.3% of cases. Risk factors for vascular complications s/p cath include age>70, female, BSA <1.6, CHF, COPD, LE vascular disease, MI, bleeding disorder, shock, and Plavix use.  Furthermore, Enoxaparin given on the day of the cath doubled the patient’s risk of bleeding.
