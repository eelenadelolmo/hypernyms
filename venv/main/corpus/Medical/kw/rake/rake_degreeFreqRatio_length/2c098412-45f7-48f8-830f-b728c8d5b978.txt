Most are asymptomatic and can be followed up over time. Surgical resection is an option depending on the location of the lesion and the patient's existing comorbidities.
CT images demonstrate a 4 mm calcific density just lateral to the right caudate nucleus. MRI demonstrates central high signal on T1 and T2 weighted images with peripheral low signal intesity within this lesion. On the GRE images, there is blooming artifact likely due to the presence of hemosiderin.
