Physical examination showed deformity and limited movement at the interphalangeal joint of the thumb.
Reduction and immobilization in slight flexion for three weeks.
A-P radiograph of the hand and oblique and lateral radiographs of the first ray show a complete dislocation of the distal phalanx of the right thumb.  On the initial film, no fracture was identified; on subsequent radiograph after reduction (not available) an avulsion fracture was noted at the base of the distal phalanx
