Ortolani maneuver produced click of the left hip, with no findings during Barlow maneuver.  Otherwise normal newborn exam.
Patient was placed in a Pavlik harness by four weeks of age with sonography showing no dislocation.  An anterioposterior plain radiograph of the pelvis at 3 months of age with the Pavlik harness in place showed left and right acetabular angles of 26 and 27 degrees respectively, without evidence of subluxation or dislocation.  An imaging series consisting of anterioposterior hips and frogleg lateral plain radiographs at 7 months showed the presence of bilateral ossification centers of the femoral head without dislocation.  A standing anterioposterior pelvis plain radiograph at 16 months showed symmetric capital femoral epiphyses without asymmetric widening, dislocation or subluxation.  A final follow up at nearly 2 years of age, consisting of an anterioposterior pelvis plain radiograph, showed normal and symmetric acetabular angles bilaterally with no evidence of femoral head uncovering.
• Nonossified proximal femoral epiphyses bilaterally.
• No hip effusion noted.
• Left hip alpha angle of 32 degrees and proximal femoral epiphysis 33% covered by the acetabulum; indicative of left hip dysplasia.
• Right hip alpha angle of 39 degrees and proximal femoral epiphysis 43% covered by the acetabulum; indicative of right hip dysplasia.
Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip
• Developmental dysplasia of the hip
• Normal neonatal hip laxity
• Cerebral palsy
• Myelodysplasia
• Arthrogryposis
• Caudal regression syndrome
• Larsen syndrome
• Stickler syndrome
• Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia
• Trevor disease
• Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia
• Metatropic dysplasia
• Mucopolysaccaridoses
6 day-old baby girl, born at term with breech presentation.  No complications during pregnancy noted.  Delivery was vaginal without instrumentation, APGARS 8 and 9.  Left hip click noted on Ortolani test during postnatal exam.  No other medical conditions.
This patient presented with clinical signs and risk factors for developmental hip dysplasia which was proven radiographically.  Early Pavlik harness placement resulted in good approximation of the hips bilaterally, with regression of the DDH and normal joint formation, as shown by routine follow-up imaging.  No evidence of avascular necrosis or other complications were seen with treatment and the patient developed normally, with no gait or other musculoskeletal abnormalities.
