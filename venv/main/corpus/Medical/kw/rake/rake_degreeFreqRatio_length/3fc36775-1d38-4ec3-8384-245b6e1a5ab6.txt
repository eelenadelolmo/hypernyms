Physical Exam demonstrates a solitary mass in the left testicle.  The area is cool to the touch and has no areas of induration.  The patient denies pain when examined.

Labs demonstrate the following:
   AFP: 88.6
   LDH: 141
   HCG <20
CT pelvis, abdomen, and chest for further staging.  All were negative, and patient was classified as T1N0M0.
The ultrasound is an axial view, which demonstrates heterogeneous echogenicity in the left testicle when compared to the right.  There are solid and cystic lesions within the heterogeneous field.  The mass measures 2.5cm long x 3, with an AP diameter of 3.3cm.
Nonseminomatous Germ Cell Tumor (T1) of the Left Testicle consisting of embryonal carcinoma, teratoma, and yolk sac.
