Small rust colored        discharge from left        with manual pressure.
Surgical excision was curative.
abrupt cut-off of contrast at a rounded filling defect in the injected duct.
Intraductal papilloma
Papilloma
Papillomatosis
Breast Cancer (especially intraductal carcinoma)
Air Bubble
Fibrocystic Changes
Duct Ectasia (not a filling defect)
Patient with a unilateral intermittent rusty        discharge for one month.
The differential diagnosis list above is for        discharge in non-lactating females.  Ductal ectasia is the second most common cause of discharge but typically has a greenish discharge and doesn't have a filling defect on ductography.  An air bubble would be mobile and not persist on subsequent imaging.
