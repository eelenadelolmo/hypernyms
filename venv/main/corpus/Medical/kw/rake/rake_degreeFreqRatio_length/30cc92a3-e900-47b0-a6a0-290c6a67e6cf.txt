Hydranencephaly is a form of cephalic disarray. Secondary to ischemic infarction of both cerebral hemispheres in the distribution of the internal carotid arteries.

There is replacement of the cerebral hemispheres by CSF. 

The parts of the brain supplied by the posterior circulation are preserved; such as the temporal lobes, occipital lobes, thalami, infratentorial structures are formed as well. 


The KEY differential diganosis is Severe Hydrocephalus. 
Both Severe Hydrocephalus and Hydraencephaly are seen with generalized increase in CSF. 
The identification of the falx can be seen in both Hydrocephalus and Hydranencephaly, so although this helps in ruling out Holoprosencephaly; it is of no help in determing a case of Hyrdocephalus versus Hydranencephaly.

The key finding in differentiating Hydrocephalus and Hydranencephaly is the cortical mantle. 

The absence of cortical mantle helps establish the diganosis of Hydranencephaly.

While the presence of a cortical mantle would imply Hydrocephalus.
