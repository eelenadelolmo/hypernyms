Generally poor prognosis. 5 year mean survival rate of 20%. Mean survival of 3-4 years following onset of symptoms. Treatment is largely ineffective.
CT Scan: Severe emphysematous and bullous changes of the upper lobes.  Peripheral honeycombing and marked interstitial thickening is noted at more inferior levels.  (Unfortunately, axial images at the lung bases demonstrating the marked apicobasal gradient of interstitial and subpleural findings was not submitted with this case).

60 pack year history of tobacco use
This patient had a biopsy showing the characteristic usual interstitial pneumonia (Normal lung with interstitial inflammation, fibroblastic proliferation, interstitial fibrosis, honeycombing) as well as PFTs showing restrictive lung disease with impaired gas exchange to make the diagnosis.
