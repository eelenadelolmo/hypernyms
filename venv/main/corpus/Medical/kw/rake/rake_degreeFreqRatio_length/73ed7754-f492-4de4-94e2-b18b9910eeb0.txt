Long term intravenous antibiotics.  Surgical debridement if necessary.
Marrow of proximal phalynx shows low T1 signal, heterogeneously bright T2 signal, high signal on STIR image, and enhances post contrast admininistration.  Note cortical defect in dorsal proximal 1/3 of phalynx, at area of puncture from dog tooth.
OSTEOMYELITIS
Sympathetic marrow edema after surgery/trauma
Malignancy
Recent XRT
Dog bite to index finger 3 weeks ago.
Clinical history is essential to concluding on the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. Noninfectious traumatic or inflammatory conditions may mimic this condition. Malignancies such as leukemia or lymphoma may have this appearance and signal pattern.
