PE:  WDWN, NAD, 71”/205#, Vitals WNL/Stable; Noncontributory physical exam except palpation of 2x3cm bony lesion at right frontotemporal region of skull that is TTP.  No neurological deficits.

LABS:  CBC, CMP, LFTs, Chol PNL all WNL, PSA 2.4 (stable).
The patient is being managed conservatively with serial observation of the lesion.  Repeat resection of lesion will be considered at a later date if lesion continues to expand or becomes more symptomatic.
Skull Series:  There is a small lesion adjacent to the right frontal sinus measuring 2.6 x 1.5 cm in size. This lesion has a partially sclerotic margin and no other significant osseous abnormality is seen.

CT:  There is an expansile intra-osseous lesion, measuring approximately 3.1 x 1.3 cm, in the right frontal bone, with a thin sclerotic rim with preservation of the trabeculae. There is an apparent disruption in the cortex anteriorly, which is well corticated and likely represents an enlarged
feeding vessel. There is no periosteal reaction.

MRI: Expansile lesion of the frontal bone.  Low in signal on T1, high signal on T2, and avid enhancement post contrast.  Foci of high signal on T1 are noted, most likely representing fat.
Calvarial Hemangioma
• Calvarial Hemangioma
• Eosinophilic Granuloma - wrong age group
• Intraosseous Meningioma
• Metastasis - unlikely since there is preservation of the trabeculae
53 y/o man with history of basal cell carcinoma presents with painful lump on right forehead.  Pt had similar lesion 9 years ago that was operated on by plastic surgery, no records available.  Lesion has been very slow growing over past year, becoming more painful on deep palpation recently.
Reports having more of the same lesions on L2 and right femur by history.  No fevers, chills, weight changes, bowel changes.  Had chronic neck pain, R arm parasthesias relieved with recent laminectomy.  No other neurologic complaints.



PMHx:  HTN, BCC on face, chronic back pain, spondylolysis with myelopathy, congenital fusion of C6/7, B12 Deficiency
Meds: B12, Methylprednisilone taper 3 months ago, Docusate Sodium, Methocarbamol, Percocet or Oxycontin for back pain
PSHx:   June 2009 C-spine Laminectomy/fusion,  Remote excision of BCC,  Remote Appendectomy
FamHx: + Cancer in family (unknown type), +CVD
Soc Hx: +Alcohol, socially, -Tob
