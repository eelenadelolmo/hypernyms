Physical examination and routine laboratory results were normal.
The tumor was surgically resected and a follow up CXR was obtained to document non-recurrence.
Large, well-circumscribed soft-tissue mass arising from the right posterior thoracic wall with no signs of invasion into adjacent structures.
Schwannoma, Thoracic
Differential diagnosis includes neoplasms such as mesothelioma, lymphoma, neurofibroma, and schwannoma as well as inflammatory causes such as tuberculosis or fungal disease.
45 y/o female with five year h/o mild intermittent chest pain for which she had not previously sought evaluation.  There was no associated cough, fever, or other disability.
The slow evolution of symptoms over several years was consistent with the eventual diagnosis of this relatively benign neoplasm.
