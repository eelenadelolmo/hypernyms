Non-febrile, normotensive, HR between 60-100
Abdomen:  Approximated wound edges, surgical incisions clean/dry/intact, two JP drains with serosanguinous fluid, decreased bowel sounds,
appropriate abdominal tenderness
None required
Slow filling well-circumscribed region with a air fluid level distal to pouch.  Area began to fill with contrast soon after contrast flowed from the pouch through the small bowel.  Region described was in continuity with small bowel.
Afferent Roux limb of small bowel
Iatrogenic Diverticula
Pre-surgical small bowel Diverticula
Afferent limb of small bowel
51 year old female with morbid obesity, hyperlipidemia, GERD.  Post-operative day #1 for laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and normal post-operative course presenting for routine swallow study.
An afferent limb of small bowel may be mistaken for a diverticula while performing a swallow study.  Resources may be wasted and post-operative recovery course may be slowed in ordering a CT to clear a possibly confusing swallow study.  This patient did not require further work-up.  The surgeon stated that the small bowel surgically attached to the pouch (stomach) was attached 4-5cm distal to the end of small bowel.
