Physical Exam and Laboratory: 
Patient is tender to palpation over the DIP and PIP joints in both hands.  No significant effusions noted over the joint spaces.  Laboratory results reported normal ESR levels
Treatment and Follow-up: 
Treatment usually begins with NSAIDs.  For more advanced cases, or for those not responding to a trial of NSAIDs, DMARDs such as methotrexate are used.  Anti TNF drugs can also be used, as is the case with this patient.  Follow-up should include periodic radiographs to assess the progression of the disease and response to therapy.
Radiographic Findings: 
Symmetric joint space loss in the distal interphalangeal joints and proximal interphalangealjoints bilaterally.  Erosions involving the metacarpal heads and fluffy erosions involving the ulnar styloid.  Erosion of the pisiforms bilaterally.  Normal bone mineralization and no remarkable soft tissue changes
Diagnosis:
Psoriatic arthritis
Differential Diagnosis for these findings in this case:
Psoriatic arthritis,  erosive osteoarthritis
History (can include gestational age, or age in days, weeks, months):
Patient with known psoriasis, now taking Enbrel.  Patient presents with pain and stiffness in both hands, made worse by inactivity and relieved somewhat by movement.
Discussion (include references): 
Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis that accompanies psoriasis in up to 30% of patients with the disease.  Most patients with psoriatic arthritis are negative for rheumatoid factor, but up to 10% can be positive for RF.  Psoriatic arthritis affects both sexes equally.  The clinical presentation is usually of joint pain and stiffness upon awakening and following periods of inactivity, alleviated by movement.  The distribution is often asymmetric, and the degree of pain and tenderness is usually less than RA.  The typical patterns of presentation are polyarthritis, similar to RA, and oligoarthritis, in which less than five joints are affected in an asymmetric fashion.  Mutilating arthritis is not as common as in RA.  Involvement of the DIP joints also differentiates PA from RA.
