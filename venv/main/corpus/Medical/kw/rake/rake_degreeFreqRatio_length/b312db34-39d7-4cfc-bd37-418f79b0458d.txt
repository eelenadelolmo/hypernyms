Normal physical examination.
Conservative management may be used for diverticula that are less than one cm in size. If the diverticula contributes to aspiration or pneumonia, surgical repair is advised if the patient can tolerate the procedure.
Frontal, lateral, and oblique images demonstrate a herniation of mucosa and submucosa in the posterior aspect of the pharyngoesophageal junction.
