None.  The screening mammogram is normal and the implants are inflated.

Breast Implant Normal Mammographic Findings: Single Lumen Saline
There are 14 types of breast implants that have been described (see references).  Of these types, the most common are:
1.  Single lumen saline 
2.  Single lumen silicone gel
3.  Standard double lumen (saline outer; silicone inner)
4.  Reverse double lumen (silicone outer; saline inner)
Screening mammogram for an asymptomatic patient
The key mammographic feature that allows recognition of a saline containing lumen is that the both the outer and inner edges of the shell (bag) are visible.   The outer edge can be seen since it is adjacent to soft tissue or fat density and the inner edge because of the saline in the lumen.  

In the majority (not all!) of single lumen saline implants the valve is situated anteriorly.  There are several different types of valves that can be seen.  In this case, as in the majority of single lumen devices encountered clinically, there is a diaphragm valve.   

Another feature that can be frequently (but not always!) seen, and confirms the implants' identity as single lumen saline devices, is that the implants' folds can be seen "en-face."

Failure of a single lumen saline implant results in deflation, since the saline it contains is absorbed by the body.   Deflation can occur because of a rent in the shell or because of dysfunction of the valve.   Deflation results in easily palpable volume loss (akin to a "flat tire").  

Thus, dedicated imaging of single lumen saline implants with ultrasound or MR is not necessary to establish the diagnosis of implant failure.
