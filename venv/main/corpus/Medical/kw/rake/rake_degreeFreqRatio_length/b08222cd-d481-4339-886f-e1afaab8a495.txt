Adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder 
Patient A:  Solid mass
Patient B:  Localized or diffuse thickening
Patient C:  Intraluminal mass.
Patient A (Film 1):  A gallbladder cannot be identified.  Instead, a large solid hypoechoic mass is seen in the region of the gallbladder fossa.  The lobulated margins of this mass extend into the adjacent liver.  The mass contains hyperechoic areas with shadowing, a finding consistent with calcifications or stones (Scan 4).  These findings strongly suggest a gallbladder carcinoma with hepatic invasion.  By ultrasound guided- needle biopsy, an adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder was diagnosed.

Patient B had an ultrasound study (Film 2, sagittal in Scan 1 and transverse in Scan 2) showing diffuse hyperechoic focal thickening of the wall of the gallbladder fundus.  No stones are identified.  These findings are confirmed on a subsequent CT (Film 2, Scans 3 and 4).  Although the thickened area appears confined to the wall, at surgery there was local liver invasion by this gallbladder adenocarcinoma. 

Patient C had an ultrasound examination (Film 3, sagittal in Scan 1 and transverse in Scan 2) that shows a hyperechoic mass originating from the anterior surface of the gallbladder fundus.  It fills the lumen of the gallbladder.  No gallstones are identified.  An adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder, without extension into the surrounding structures, was detected at time of surgery.
Patient A (Film 1) is an elderly female who presents with fatigue and right upper quadrant pain.  There is no history of previous abdominal surgery.  Patient B had an ultrasound and a CT examination (combined on Film 2).  Patient C had an ultrasound study (Film 3).  These three patients have different appearances of the same entity.  What is your diagnosis?
Primary gallbladder carcinoma is an uncommon but highly malignant neoplasm.  Curative surgical resection is unusual, probably due to the vague or similar symptoms to pre-existing gallbladder disease.  The neoplasm itself may initially cause few, if any, symptoms.  The patient commonly seeks medical care only after the tumor has infiltrated into adjacent structures such as liver, bile ducts, and bowel, or has metastasized.

Sonographically, gallbladder carcinoma may have different appearances:

1. A solid mass filling and often obliterating the gallbladder lumen.  The gallbladder may not be recognizable.  The neoplasm appears as a solid mass occupying the gallbladder fossa, often associated with gallstones (Patient A).

2. Localized or diffuse thickening of the gallbladder wall (Patient B).

3. Intraluminal polypoid or fungating mass (Patient C).

The vast majority of patients with gallbladder carcinoma will demonstrate cholelithiasis.  Other findings such as dilated bile ducts, regional adenopathy, or hepatic metastases may be seen.  There is an increased incidence of gallbladder carcinoma in patients with gallbladder wall calcification (porcelain gallbladder), though most gallbladder carcinomas will not demonstrate this finding.

Nonmalignant causes of gallbladder wall thickening, such as cholecystitis and hyperplastic cholecystosis, can simulate gallbladder carcinoma.  Malignant entities which may cause confusion include pancreatic carcinoma and metastasis to the gallbladder (the most common being malignant melanoma).
