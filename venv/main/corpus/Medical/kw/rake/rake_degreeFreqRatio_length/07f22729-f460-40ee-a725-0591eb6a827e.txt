Tenderness of distal left lower leg
Antibiotics
Plain film radiographs of the ankle are normal, without evidence of periosteal reaction, fracture, effusion or bone erosion.

MRI shows heterogeneous low T1 and high T2 signal bone marrow with post-gadolinium enhancement in the distal tibial metaphysis, and surrounding soft tissue swelling and enhancement --- findings consistent with acute osteomyelitis.
Acute Osteomyelitis, Child
Acute Osteomyelitis
Ewing Sarcoma
8 year old male with fever and ankle pain
The differential considerations in this case included Ewing sarcoma and osteomyelitis. Listed below are findings that would lead to one daignosis versus the other...

Osteomyelitis (<5 yo)
-More rapid rate of progression after onset of symptoms
-Plain film can be normal
-Occurs at metaphysis – rich but slow flowing blood
+/- soft tissue swelling

Ewing sarcoma (>5 yo)
-Slower course with destructive changes
-Aggressive periosteal reaction (spiculated, lamellated)
-Permeative appearance
-Associated soft tissue mass – larger than amount of bone destruction
