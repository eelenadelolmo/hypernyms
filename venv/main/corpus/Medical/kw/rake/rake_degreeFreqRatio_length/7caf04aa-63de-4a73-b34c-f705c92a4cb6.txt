Multiple nodules palpable on physical exam of both breasts. Non-tender. Laboratory - noncontributory
Annual mammogram. Routine, regular self-exam is emphasized in this patient.
The breast tissue is heterogeneously dense. There are numerous silicone granulomas, too numerous to count, in both breasts obscuring detail. There is no evidence of a suspicious mass or architectural distortion, and no suspicious clustered microcalcifications are visible.
Silicone Granulomas of the Breast
Granulomas from silicone injection
Multiple cysts
Multiple fibroadenomas

Screening mammogram. History of breast augmentation.
This patient had a questionable palpable lesion in the left breast that had been followed by mammography and ultrasound at another institution for three years and was thought to be stable over that time period. No images were available for review. The ultrasound report stated, "due to diffuse shadowing and increased echogenicity of the breasts, it is difficult to assess for any masses."

If this patient feels a change or a new mass, breast MR with IV contrast in addition to mammography may be considered in this complex evaluation, but may yield disappointing results like the ultrasound evaluation.
