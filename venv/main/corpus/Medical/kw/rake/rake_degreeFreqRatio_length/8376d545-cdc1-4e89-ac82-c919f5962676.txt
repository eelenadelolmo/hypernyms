Noncontributory.
Patient was followed with repeat radiographs of the chest until resolution.
Two portable frontal radiographs of the chest show a linear lucency along the left mediastinal edge as well as a well-circumscibed opacity with lobulated contour at the left mid to upper lung with surrounding increased lucency.  There are no air bronchograms within this opacity to suggest consolidation.  These findings suggest the diagnosis of anterior pneumothorax. 

Selected axial CT images of the chest (in lung windows) confirm the presence of a left anterior pneumothorax.
Anerior Pneumothorax; confirmed by CT.
Little differential is necessary; as stated, this appearance may be confused with air space disease or, perhaps, a loculated pleural fluid collection.  However, the characteristic features listed in the image findings section should allow one to make a definitive diagnosis of pneumothorax.
The patient is a 55 year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer.  Two “routine” portable AP radiographs of the chest are obtained.  A CT examination of the chest performed later and for other reasons confirms one of the findings made initially on the portable films.
