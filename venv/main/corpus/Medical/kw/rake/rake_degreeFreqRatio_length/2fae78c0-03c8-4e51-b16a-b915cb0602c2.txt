Rectal temp at time of ED presentation was 102.8.  

LP performed at ED in Cuba revealed CSF white count of 98, RBC 600, Protein 40, Gram Stain significant for Gram Positive Cocci.  

PE stateside revealed an obtunded WNWD male, responsive only to noxious stimuli, with asymmetric pupils, L larger than R.  
HSV 1 CSF titer HIGH, HSV II negative.
IV acyclovir, supportive care
MRI revealed increased T2 signal intensity in R frontotemporal region, as well as insular gyri, right worse than left.  R cingulate gyrus noted to have increased signal intensity compared to L side.  Mild effacement of right lateral ventricle is also seen.
Herpes Encephalitis (HSV 1)
A. Vascular – 
   1. ischemia 
   2. infarction

B. Inflammatory – 
   1. encephalitis
