Patient’s chart unavailable for review
Patient underwent closed reduction internal fixation of right femoral neck.  Post-reduction films for this patient revealed three intertrochanteric screws and good alignment of the bony tissues.
A-P radiograph of the hips  shows no apparent fracture
Follow-up A-P radiograph of the hips shows a sclerotic line in inferior aspect of the femoral neck consistent with a healing stress  fracture.
MRI- T1 weighted images showing linear hypointensity at the inferior aspect of the right femoral neck with consistent with a stress fracture. This area became high signal intensity on STIR MR images.
Stress fracture right femoral neck.
Stress fracture right femoral neck
21 year old female with right hip pain after recent increase in physical activity.
Stress fractures occur as a result of repetitive submaximal stress on normal bone, which results in a region of bone undergoing accelerated bone remodeling. This in turn can lead to microtrabecular breaks and ultimate cortical injury as the rate of osteoclast activity exceeds the rate of new bone formation. Two types of femoral neck stress fractures have been identified in adolescents/young adults-transverse fractures to the superior portion of the femoral neck, and compression fractures to the inferior portion of the femoral neck. Management of the more proximal fracture is with closed reduction and internal fixation.  Initially, conservative therapy (non-weight bearing, reduction of physical activity) can be attempted for stress fractures involving the distal femoral neck, but failure of conservative therapy or delay in diagnosis will also lead to surgical intervention.
