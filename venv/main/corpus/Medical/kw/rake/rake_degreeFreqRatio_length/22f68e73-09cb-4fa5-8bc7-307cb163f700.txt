Dermatologist’s Recommendation / Dx
Unknown. Refer to Oral Pathology or EENT

1st Oral Pathologist’s Recommendation / Dx
It appears to to be a benign lesion, potentially a papilla formed/ forming on the left tonsil.  The fact that it is well circumscribed from this view, and non-ulcerated lends to a benign entity.  I would suggest keeping an eye on it, have it removed when it doesn&#39;t interfere with deployment, and be aware that if symptoms increase (ie. pain, ulceration, cobblestone appearance of the overlying epithelium), another look would be warranted and potential removal indicated sooner, rather than later.  This would probably involve removal of the left tonsil to ensure that the entire lesion was removed.  Again, OK to watch for now with regular checks, as it is likely a benign lesion.  

2nd Oral Pathologist’s Recommendation / Dx
The other thing I would add to diff dx is probably accessory lymphoid tissue & it is very common back at the base of the tongue/oropharynx area.

3rd Oral Pathologist’s Recommendation / Dx
The elevated round pink area on the left tonsil appears to be approximately 4 mm in diameter.  My impression is that it could be an oral lymphoepithelial cyst or an occluded tonsillar crypt.  Both conditions are benign.  To answer the question, yes, it is okay to periodically observe for the next 6 months.

Dx/DDx: Benign Lesion
oral lymphoepithelial cyst
occluded tonsillar crypt
accessory lymphoid tissue
30 y/o male security forces member who first noticed this pink fleshy growth in the left tonsillar area about 3 weeks ago.
It doesn&#39;t appear to be growing any larger and he doesn&#39;t complain about it being painful, but we would like to know if you can tell what it is and whether it is a benign growth that is okay to watch for the next 6 months while he is deployed or if it&#39;s something he needs to have removed sooner than 6 months from now.
