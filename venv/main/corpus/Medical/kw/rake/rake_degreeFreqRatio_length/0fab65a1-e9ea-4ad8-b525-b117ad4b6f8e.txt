Located in the left lateral convexity of the cranial vault is a well- circumscribed, peripherally based, extra-axial lesion that is nearly isointense to cerebral cortex on both T1 and T2 imaging sequences. The lesion also demonstrates intense homogeneous enhancement following administration of gadolinium. There is evident thickening and abnormal enhancement of the adjacent meninges consistent with a “dural tail sign," which is most commonly associated with a meningioma
Meningioma
70 yo man with a 3 month history of transient episodes of right upper extremity weakness, dysarthria, and expressive aphasia which was refractory to aspirin and ticlopidine therapy. Past medical history was significant only for hypertension. On admission, CT (without contrast) was negative for hemorrhage and masses.
Meningiomas account for 13 to 18 percent of intracranial tumors. They demonstrate a female predominance, and occur primarily in adults from ages 20 to 60, with a peak age of 45 years.  Clinical symptoms are usually nonspecific, consisting of headache, visual impairment, and seizures, but focal weakness and numbness in an opposite extremity may be present if the mass compresses the brain around the rolandic fissure. 

Meningiomas are normally benign tumors (WHO Grade 1) arising from meningothelial cells (arachnoid villi). The parasagittal region is the most frequent site for meningiomas, followed by the cranial convexity, sphenoid wings, parasellar region, olfactory groove, cerebellopontine angle, and the intraventricular region (rare). Ninety percent of meningiomas are supratentorial, with two thirds occurring in the anterior half of the skull.  Lesions are usually single, but in 1 to 2 percent of cases they are multiple. Multiple meningiomas are usually seen in association with neurofibromatosis type 2. 

Blood supply to the lesion usually comes from meningeal branches of the external carotid artery or, less commonly, from meningeal branches of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries.

On MRI, the majority of meningiomas have a signal intensity similar to that of gray matter on all sequences. Densely calcified lesions may be hypointense on imaging. T1-weighted  images often provide the best description of anatomic distortion and displacement of cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter (white matter buckling), a sign of an extra-axial lesion. An interface between brain parenchyma and lesion can often be identified; this may be related to a CSF cleft, a vascular rim, or a dural margin. A CSF cleft sign is best seen as a rim of hyperintensity on T2-weighted images.

Meningiomas show intense enhancement with gadolinium and are sharply circumscribed. They have a characteristic broad base of dural attachment, but this may be evident only with imaging in sagittal or coronal planes. An enhancing “dural tail” may be seen in up to 60 percent of meningiomas. In the majority of cases, this is a reactive phenomenon and does not represent tumor extension to the dura. Mass effect may be mild and less than would he expected for the size of the tumor. This is explained by resulting local pressure atrophy occurring at a rate similar to tumor growth. 

Meningiomas may erode adjacent bone or stimulate new bone formation.  Hyperostosis may or may not be associated with bone invasion by meningioma cells.
