WBC 7400, PMN 64 %, L 23.6%, Mono 8.4%, E 3.0%
ESR 124  (1-19 mm/hr)
CRP 8.1  (0.071 – 5 mg/dl)
Tissue culture: Staphylococcus auereus
Amputation of distal phalanx and systemic antibiotics.
PA radiograph of the right hand shows osteoarthritic changes of the DIP, PIP, and first MCP joints consistent with osteoarthritis.  The fifth digit demonstrates soft tissue swelling with lysis of the distal phalanx.

74 yo diabetic male
This diabetic male had a history of preceding soft tissue infections which lead to numerous amputations of digits in his lower extremities.  His most current episode involved a refractory soft tissue infection.  

When infection sets in, there are local metabolic changes and inflamation that increase necrosis.  As this disease progresses, local thrombophlebitis occurs which increase edema and intraosseous pressure.  This, in turn, leads to the development of sequestra, an ischemic area of bone.  Once the cortical bone is disrupted, subperiosteal abscesses develop with inflammation inducing new bone formation in adjacent soft tissue.  The earliest osseous changes by plain radiographs are osteopenic or lytic lesions.  This requires 30 to 50% decalcification to be detected and take 2 weeks to 1 month to develop.
