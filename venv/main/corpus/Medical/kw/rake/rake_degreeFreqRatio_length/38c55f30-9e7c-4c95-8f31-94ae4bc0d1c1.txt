Well-circumscribed lesion off inferior aspect right lobe of the liver which is hyperattenuating on arterial phases imaging and becomes isoattenuating on more delayed images.  A central lower attenuating focus can be seen which may represent the "central scar".

NOTE: Tc-99m sulfur colloid scan (not included) revealed increased uptake in this region in relation to the remainder of the liver.

Although a hypoattenuating central scar is pathognomonic, it is usually seen in only around 50% of cases.  The central scar is hypoattenuating on portal venous phase imaging, but slowly increases in attenuation through diffusion of the contrast agent and may become relatively hyperattenuating on delayed images.

A large percentage of lesions may show one of more atypical features (heterogenous early contrast enhancement, ill-defined larger lesions on arterial scans, hypoattenuating portal venous phase lesions due to wash-out effects, compressed parenchyma surrounding lesions causing a hyperattenuating rim or 'pseudocapsule').  In these cases, confirmation by other imaging techniques (Tc-sulfur colloid) or even biopsy is indicated.
