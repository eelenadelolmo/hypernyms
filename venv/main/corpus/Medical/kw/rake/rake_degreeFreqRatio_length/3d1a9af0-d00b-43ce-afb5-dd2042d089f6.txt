The patient most likely developed a dilated renal collecting system prior to being treated for her ureteropelvic junction obstruction at age two.  The collecting system is dilated; however, it clears in a normal fashion as proven by the renal Lasix study.  The patient’s renal function should be monitored; however, no further work up for the dilated renal collecting system initially seen on ultrasound is required.
Renal Ultrasound:
The left kidney is normal in appearance measuring 11.7 cm in the long axis.
The right kidney demonstrates cortical thinning with moderate dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces.  The right kidney measures 9.2 cm in the long axis.

Renal Lasix Scintigraphy:
On flow images, the right and left kidneys are visualized simultaneously.  On the serial static images, peak renal cortical activity and renal cortical transit occur within five minutes bilaterally, despite asymmetric differential renal function (L>R).  By the end of the initial static imaging sequence, there is near complete washout from the left kidney.  The right kidney has persistence of radiotracer within the collecting system.  Post-void images show persistence of radiotracer within the right renal collecting system (not shown).  Following the administration of lasix, prompt washout of radiotracer occurs from the right renal collecting system with a washout half time of less than 10 minutes consistent with a non-obstructed renal collecting system (i.e. non-obstructive right pelvicaliectasis).
Pelvicaliectasis
Obstructive Causes (i.e. mechanical obstruction--not present in this case):
Ureteropelvic Junction Obstruction
UV Junction Obstruction
Ureteral Obstruction/Stricture
Ureterocele
Bladder Outlet Obstruction
Urethral valves
Obstructing Pelvic Mass
Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy
The patient presented with frequent urinary tract infections.  Her past medical history was notable for a ureteropelvic junction obstruction repair at the age two.
This patient does not, by definition, have hydronephrosis.  The term hydronephrosis by definition indicates that an obstruction exists.  This patient has a dilated renal pelvis and calyces; however, these are not obstructed. 

If Lasix had not been given, the patient would have cleared the urine from the right kidney.  However, it might have taken as long as 2 to 4 hours for the urine to clear.  The Lasix was given to shorten the time of the exam and help determine whether or not a true obstruction was present.  The washout half time after Lasix administration for this patient was less than 10 minutes which generally indicates no significant obstruction.  A washout half time greater than 20 minutes is generally consistent with obstruction while a washout half time between 10 and 20 minutes is generally considered indeterminate (in the setting of normal function).  

This renal Lasix exam was successful because the patient had sufficient renal function for the Lasix to result in a significant diuresis.  Patients should be well hydrated prior to the exam so that fluid is available for mobilization in response to the diuretic and to prevent dehydration.

This renal scintigraphic study was performed using Tc-99m  DTPA.  DTPA is a good agent to use when the patient has no renal insufficiency.  100% of the DTPA is taken up by the kidney through glomerular filtration.  If glomerular filtration is impaired as in renal insufficiency, a better agent to use would be Tc-99m MAG3.  Only approximately 10% of MAG3 is taken up by the kidney through glomerular filtration.
