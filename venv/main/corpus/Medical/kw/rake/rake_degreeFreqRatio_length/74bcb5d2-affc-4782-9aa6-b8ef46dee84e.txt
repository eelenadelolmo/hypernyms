No reported abnormalities of physical exam or laboratory values
In this particular case the patient will likely have surgical correction (sling) for urinary incontinence.
Pelvic MR: A neovagina is present between the bladder, urethra and the rectum.  Thin region of signal intensity equivalent to fluid is present within the neovagina.  Soft tissue signal is present at the proximal urethra posterior and adjacent to the bladder, likely atrophic prostate and seminal vesicles. The diameter of the urethra cannot be adequately measured and is coapted.
There is no evidence of urethral dilatation on the strain images (not provided).
Male-to-Female transsexual
Female status post hysterectomy with periurethral mass.
Male to Female transsexual with retained prostate and seminal vessicles.
54 year old male to female transsexual with a complaint of vaginal stenosis and urinary incontinence; evaluation of pelvic anatomy for surgical planning was requested.
Previous surgical history is the key to evaluating the images properly.  In the absence of history, one could easily consider a female patient with a periurethral mass status post hysterectomy.
