Texto: 
Incresed respiratory rate
Decreased lung sounds to auscultation on right
Upper posterior right thorax hyperresonant to percussion
Urgent chest tube placement, aspiration of pneumothorax, and attachment of tube to a Pneumo-Vac.
Absent lung marking in the peripheral right hemithorax
A thin dense line demarcates the pleural margin of a partially collasped lung
There are multiple area of atelectasis and approximately 40% volume loss involving the right lung
There is yet to be any significant shift of mediastinal structures toward the left
The left lung and pleural space appear normal
No fractures or free air in the soft tissues is seen
Primary spontaneous pneumothorax
Traumatic pneumothorax
Iatrogenic pneumothorax
Spontaneous pneumothorax
Sudden onset of shortness of breath.
The absence of signs of trauma, the history of abrupt onset of symptoms, and the patient’s sex and age are typical of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.  Placement of a chest tube will be necessary to insure that a tension pneumothorax does not evolve and lead to cardiovascular failure.  With conservative management, this pneumothorax will resolve easily and recurrence is unlikely.  The patient should be counseled before discharge not to smoke or scuba dive, as these activities increase the risk of recurrence.
