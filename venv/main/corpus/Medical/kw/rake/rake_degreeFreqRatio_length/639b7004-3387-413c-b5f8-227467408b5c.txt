Mental retardation
Left sided hemiplegia
Pathologic examination of the cyst revealed inflammatory tissue, hemorrhage, necrotic elements, and dystrophic wall and vascular calcifications without evidence of neoplasm.
CT- multiple calcified masses in both cerebral hemispheres.  Atrophy and bilateral leukomalacia

MRI- Large hemorrhagic cyst left frontal lobe (fluid/fluid level).
Very dystropic looking brain due to TORCH  infection probably toxoplasmosis.
Multiple foci of contrast enchancement following contrast
TORCH infection by Hx
Enlarging hemorrhagic cyst mass, inflammatory
Hemorrhagic cyst of uknown etiology, possibly neoplastic
Severe sequelae of  encephalitis (probably due to intrauterine infection)
21 year old woman who has a history of prenatal TORCH infection.  She has lived independently until 8 months prior to admission.  Slow deterioration of mental status noted along with left-sided hemiplegia.
The patient with a known history of TORCH infection underwent surgical evacuation because of progressive symptoms thought to be related to the right frontal cystic mass.  Neoplasm was the primary concern in this patient, but was not confirmed by pathologic examination.  Cystic encephalomalacia may be caused by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy - as well as TORCH infections (CMV).
