Texto: 
Hyperechoic renal pyramids with faint shadowing.
Medullary Nephrocalcinosis likely secondary to Wilson's syndrome
Pathognomonic.
causes include:
Hyperparathyroidism
Renal tubular acidosis
Medullary sponge kidney
Papillary necrosis
Other: Drugs (furosemide,amphotericin,steroids,etc), chronic pyelonephritis
