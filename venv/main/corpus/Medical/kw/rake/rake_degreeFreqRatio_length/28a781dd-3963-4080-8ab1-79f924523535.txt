This woman is status post craniotomy for breast cancer metastatic to brain - a piece of history that was witheld.  Prognosis is generally improved if cerebral metastatic deposits are treated or removed.  She has also received chemotherapy. The new presence of drop metastases in the spine has a poor prognosis.  These spinal lesions may have resulted from direct hematogenous spread to nerve roots - or, they may be "drop mets" from the previous brain lesions.
Diffuse nodular areas of enhancement along the surface of the spinal cord and about the nerve roots of the cauda equina.
Droplet metastases
Drop Metastases:
» Primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET)
» Medulloblastoma
» Anaplastic or Malignant Astrocytoma
» Ependymoma
» Germinoma
» Pineoblastoma
» Choroid plexus carcinoma

Hematogenous spread from primary lung or breast cancer, melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma

Less likley...
» Arachnoiditis
» Granulomatous disease
» Neurofibromatosis
• NF1 - neurofibromas
• NF2 - Schwannoma
» Epidermoid dissemination
This 43-year-old woman has a history of breast cancer.
Intradural extramedullary spinal metastases occur hematogenously or via CSF seeding. Hematogenous spread is most common and usually occurs with lung and breast carcinomas, and melanoma. CNS tumors with access to the ventricular system such as medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and choroid plexus carcinoma or aggressive tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme are usually responsible for CSF seeding. Cortical tumors that breach the pial surface (like metastases and oligodendroglioma) may also cause CSF spread.

Drop metastases are likely to be found in the pediatric population, where they are related to medulloblastoma, ependymoma, choroid plexus tumors, or pineal germ cell neoplasms. These lesions typically occur in the dorsal lower-thoracic to lumbar spine, with the nerve roots and the cauda equina as common sites of spread - probably due to upright posture and gravity.

MR imaging is the best modality to use to evaluate the contents of the spinal canal and detect drop metastases. Subarachnoid tumor implants are typically hyperintense to CSF on T1 and hypointense on T2. 

Post-gadolinium images demonstrate diffuse linear and nodular areas of enhancement along the nerve roots and the peripheral surface of the cord. 

Processes such as arachnoiditis, neurofibromatosis and granulomatous disease may demonstrate a similar nodular enhancement and clinical history is helpful in narrowing the differential. Arachnoiditis may show clumping of nerve roots.

Depending on the number of lesions, position, and extent of lesions, the management of drop metastases may consist of steroids, local radiation therapy, or surgery.
