PATIENT A:  Left wrist radiographs show, spaced, dense, tranverse, lines, in the metaphysis and distal diaphysis.

PATIENT B: Left ankle radiographs show, spaced, dense, tranverse, lines, in the metaphysis and distal diaphysis.
Growth Arrest Lines
• Growth Arrest Lines
• Heavy Metal Poisoning
• Idiopathic
There are two different patients:
PATIENT A:  12 y/o male with left hand pain.

PATIENT B:  13 y/o female twisted left ankle.
Growth arrest lines or growth disturbance lines, as the name describes, are the result of a temporary slowdown of normal longitudinal growth during a period of illness.  These lines become radiographically visible following a subsequent period of normal growth.  Transverse lines of increased radiographic density in the metaphyses of long bones have been recognized for over 80 years.
