Soft tissue mass on dorsum of foot enlarging over 8 month time period.
The patient was treated with open biopsy and subsequent surgical excision. Patient will be followed clinically for any recurrent masses and repeat MR if clinically necessary.
Multiple MR images demonstrate a soft tissue mass on the dorsum of the right foot.  It measures approximately 3 cm Coronal  X 2 cm Transverse X 4 cm Sagittal.  It is arising from the tendon sheath between the third and forth metatarsals and extends dorsally.  It has heterogeneous signal which is iso- to hypo- intense relative to muscle on all sequences.  It demonstrates heterogeneous enhacement after gadolinium administration.  The mass does not cause erosions into the surrounding bony cortex nor does it cause any periosteal reaction, which gives it a non-aggressive appearance.
