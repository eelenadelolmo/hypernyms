A CT showed a markedly enlarged sella with a slightly enhancing, homogeneous lesion bulging superiorly into the suprasellar cistern. The patient was referred to a neurosurgeon who obtained the additional history of impotence and fatigue for one year, and a loss of body hair for two to three years. A recommendation for pituitary surgery was ignored.

Six years later, secondary to diverticulitis, the patient developed sepsis, septic shock, and an intraabdominal abscess. Despite treatment including steroids and thyroid hormone for his known hypothyroidism, the patient died after a brief hospitalization.
