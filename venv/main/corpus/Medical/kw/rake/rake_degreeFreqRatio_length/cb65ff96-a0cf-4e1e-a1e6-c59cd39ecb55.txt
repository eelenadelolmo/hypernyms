Surgery for resection.  Since a gross total resection was accomplished no radiation or chemotherapy is contemplated at this time.
CT: There is hydrocephalus of both lateral and the third ventricle.  There is a vermian mass overlying the fourth ventricle location.  This lesion is "cystic" (fluid-like) with some punctuate calcification seen on CT.  On the MR, there is some peripheral contrast enhancement of the mass.
Pilomyxoid Astrocytoma (PMA) WHO Grade 2
Pilocytic Astrocytoma (WHO Gr 1)
Hemangioblastoma (WHO Gr 1)
