This segment of lung will probably be resected.  However, no definite therapy has been done yet.  Update will follow
• Chest radiograph demonstrates opacity in LLL.   Thin slice CT with IV contrast in arterial phase demonstrates no abnormal vessels extending to this consolidation to indicate that this may be a sequestration.

• A repeat chest radiograph and a CT after 10 day antibiotic therapy demonstrates partial resolution of retrocardiac opacity.  CT shows segmental bronchiectasis most likely resulting from numerous prior infections.
Bronchiectasis
• Bronchiectasis
• CCAM (this case demonstrates dilated bronchi and not cysts as in CCAM)
• Pulmonary Sequestration - (no abnormal blood supply in this case)
15 year old boy, air evacuated from Japan with a history of recurrent productive cough.
