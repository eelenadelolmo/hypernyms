Non-contributory
Aneurysm coiled.
CT- poorly defined mass involving both frontal lobes.
    No evidence of hydrocephalus

MR-  Bifrontal hematomas.  No evidence of enhancement.
    Flow void demonstrated within right sided hematoma
    on T1 saggital scans

Angiogram-Confirms presence of ACA aneurysm
          mild vasospasm noted
Ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm complicated by vasospasm post-clipping
Glioblastoma multiforme
Metastatic disease
Post traumatic hematomas
58 year old female with headache and confusion.
Presented to another hospital 3 weeks prior to admission with similar symptoms.  No imaging done at that time.
Due to delay in obtaining the CT study, and the fact that the hematoma was isodense with brain, the clinical team was concerned that the patient had a neoplasm did not considerer ruptured aneurysm as source of mass seen on CT.

Lack of contrast enhancement and demonstration of aneurysm on MRI convinced neurosurgeons to order an angiogram and delay contemplated biopsy.
