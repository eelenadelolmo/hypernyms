He is in coma
Supportive care was terminated two days after the MR scan.  The patient was an organ donor.
â€¢ CT:  loss of normal gray-matter - white-matter junction differentiation
    Small ventricular size for age. = suggesting brain swelling

â€¢ MRI:  Brain edema with small ventricles and tight posterior fossa.  Abnormal increase in signal contrast between white and gray matter on DWI and ADC map.

â€¢ There is cerebral swelling with central midline herniation.
Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
