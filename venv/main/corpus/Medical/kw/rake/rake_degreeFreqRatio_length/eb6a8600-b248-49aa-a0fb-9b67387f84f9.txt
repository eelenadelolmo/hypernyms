10 yo girl with known disease for routine followup
NF1 or von Recklinghausen disease is an autosomal dominant disorder, from a mutation on chromosome 17.  It is found in approximately 1 in 3000 individuals.  Common findings include caf?-au-lait spots, axillary or inguinal freckling, neurofibromas, optic gliomas, Lisch nodules, a variety of bony lesions, including dural ectasia with associated scalloping of the posterior vertebral bodies, pseudoarthrosis, CNS and soft tissue tumors, cognitive deficits, learning disabilities, seizures and macrocephaly.
