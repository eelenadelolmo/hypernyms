Texto: 
Large left neck mass and fullness in nasopharynx and oropharynx.
Resection of the mass planned with a combined neurosurgery and ENT surgery team approach
â€¢ Large left middle cranial fossa mass with left sided neck component.
â€¢ Mass is complex in signal and enhances dramatically.
â€¢ There is smooth bone erosion of the skull base.
Giant Trigeminal Schwannoma
â€¢ Schwannoma
â€¢ Neurofibroma
â€¢ Sarcoma
â€¢ Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor
â€¢ Glomus Tumor
27 year old man with a one year history of left facial numbness and decreased hearing in left ear.  He presents now with double vision.
It is unclear exactly from where this mass originated.  Based on its location and presentation, the fifth cranial nerve (trigeminal) nerve is the likely source of the tumor.
