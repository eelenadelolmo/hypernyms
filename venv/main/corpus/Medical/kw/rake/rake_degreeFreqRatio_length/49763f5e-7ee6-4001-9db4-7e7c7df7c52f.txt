Referral to infectious disease for signs of infection, observation of ectopic kidney with referral to urology if complications or symptoms arise.
The terminal ileum appeared somewhat irregular, and the adjacent bowel loops were significantly separated from it. Although this can be seen with inflammatory bowel disease and associated proliferation of the surrounding mesenteric fat, lymphoma could also cause this appearance and a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV and oral contrast is recommended.

CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast: 
1. Right pelvic kidney. This displaces adjacent bowel loops and partially effaces the terminal ileum, accounting for the abnormalities seen on the small bowel follow-through.
2. Multiple ill-defined somewhat nodular opacities in the visualized portions of the right lower lobe, right middle lobe, left lower lobe, and lingula. Although cannot exclude neoplasia, suspect this is more likely to be infectious/inflammatory.
Unilateral (right) renal ectopia
1.	Ectopic kidney
2.	Fused pelvic kidney
3.	Primary pelvic tumor
4.	Hydronephrosis
5.	Uteropelvic junction obstruction
6.	Duplicate collecting systems
10 y.o. boy with no significant past medical history who presented with to PCP poor appetite, failure to thrive, and fatigue for 6 weeks.  He also complained of intermittent fevers, unknown amount of weight loss, night sweats, and vague discomfort in his abdomen and extremities.
This patient presented for work up of poor appetite, failure to thrive, fatigue, and weight loss for 6 weeks.  On small bowel follow through, the patientâ€™s bowel loops were significantly separated from an irregular appearing ileum. This prompted further imaging with abdominal and pelvic CT with contrast, which incidentally showed right pelvic kidney.  Although the ectopic kidney may have partially caused his symptoms, the patient was referred to infectious disease due to the likelihood that the etiology of his symptoms were infections or inflammatory.  The patients should be monitored for any genitourinary signs in the future with immediate referral to urology should complications arise.
