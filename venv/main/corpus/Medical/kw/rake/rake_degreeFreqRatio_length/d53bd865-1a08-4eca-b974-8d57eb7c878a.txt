Bilateral mastectomy was advised.
Bilateral circumscribed masses, the mass on left is associated with pleomorphic calcifications.
Bilateral breast carcinoma
-Fibroadenoma
-Cysts
-Malignancy (primary or metastatic)
Asymptomatic.
Pathologic diagnosis on both left and right side: papillary carcinoma in situ,lobular carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ.  
The patient in the above case has elected to have breast conserving therapy, despite recommendation for bilateral mastectomy. 
In a recent study based in the Netherlands*, patients with synchronous breast cancer (defined as bilateral breast cancer – BBC - cancer diagnosed in both breasts at the same time or within a period of 3 months of diagnosis of the first tumor) had a worse prognosis and survival than in patients with unilateral breast cancer (UBC).   Patients with BBC showed a higher proportion of tubular carcinoma and medially located tumors, a greater 5- and 10-year local recurrence rate and nearly double the 5- and 10-year distant metastasis rate.
As synchronous breast carcinoma represents a minority of cases (1.5%), it’s optimal management continues to be under debate.
