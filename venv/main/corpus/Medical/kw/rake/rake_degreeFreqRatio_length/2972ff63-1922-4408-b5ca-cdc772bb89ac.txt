Restrictive pulmonary function testing.
Corticosteroids.  Avoidance of the allergen if known.
Chest PA/LAT:  Normal lung volumes with reticulo-nodular interstitial pattern best seen in the mid and lower lung zones.  No effusion or adenopathy.

High resolution CT:  Diffuse centrilobular nodules in all lung fields but greatest in the mid lungs.  No pleural effusion or pulmonary nodules.  No adenopathy.
Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis confirmed after lung biospy.
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
Usual interstitial pneumonitis
Atypical sarcoidosis
Other granulomatous diseases
42 y/o man with no previous lung disease.  Several months of dyspnea and restrictive pulmonary function testing results.  The patient did not improve while hospitalized.
Hypersensitivity was entertained as the most likely diagnosis after the first CT images were generated.  Confounding this "classic" presentation was the fact that the patient did not improve after hospitalization, as many patients do once isolated from the inciting allergen.  The patient clearly has a subacute case.  There is no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis and a full recovery can be expected, however, the specific allergen responsible for his condition has yet to be identified.
