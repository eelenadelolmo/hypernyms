Texto: 
Fracture of the distal radial shaft with an associated dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint.
Galeazzi Fracture
Given the history of trauma and plain film findings- the diagnosis is the differential
32 year old male pushed from behind at Comerica Park by his girlfriend.
Galeazzi fractures arise in the mid to distal third of the radius, coupled with a dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint.
An Italian surgeon, Ricardo Galeazzi,described the compliment to the Monteggia fracture; a radial shaft fracture with an associated dislocation of the radioulnar joint.
The typical mechanism of injury is secondary to a fall on an extended hand with the elbow flexed.
Galeazzi and Monteggia fractures are fractures in which there is a dislocation of the other bone.
