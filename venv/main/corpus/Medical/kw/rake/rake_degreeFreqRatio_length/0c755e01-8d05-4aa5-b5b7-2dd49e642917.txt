Obtunded with no focal neurological signs.
Endovascular coil placement into aneurysm.
CT  Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with left frontal lobe intracerebral hematoma. 

CTA and DSA   6mm anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  Markedly stenotic right M1 and M2 segments of the middle cerebral artery.  Small collateral vessels reconstitute distal vascular territory.
Moya Moya disease 
Ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm
Ruptured Aneurysm
Bleeding vascular malformation or neoplasm
MVC with traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)
55 y.o. man presents with a first time seizure and sudden loss of consciousness.
Aneursym formation is likely due to turbulent collateral flow through the anterior communicating artery from the compromised status of the middle cerebral artery on the right.
