Noncontributory.
This case resulted in fetal demise at a clinical age of 22w +4d.  
Autopsy demonstrated ambiguous genetalia.
Prenatal ultrasound shows large septated fluid collection in the nuchal fold region.  Also present are large bilateral pleural effusions, ascites, and diffuse skin thickening in other body regions.  There is overall oligohydramnios.
Cystic hygroma (Turner's syndrome) with hydrops
Hydrops:
Immune-related hydrops fetalis (Rh isoimmunization; alloimmune hemolytic disease)

Nonimmune-related hydrops fetalis 
    Fetal Causes: fetal cardiac abnormalities, high output cardiac failure (peripheral shunts), venous or lymphatic obstruction (masses in the chest or abdomen), chromosomal
    Maternal - Placental insufficiency
21 year old G2P1 female presents for routine second trimester ultrasound.
Hydrops is often a pre-fatal event for the fetus.  The key is to differentiate "treatable" vs "non-treatable" causes.  If secondary to a mass-effect, severe cardiac anomaly or placental insufficiency in a fetus at viability, delivery and surgery may repair the cause.
