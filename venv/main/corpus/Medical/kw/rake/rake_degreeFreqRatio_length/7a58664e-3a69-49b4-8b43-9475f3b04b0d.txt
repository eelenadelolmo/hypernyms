Texto: 
Scattered, well-defined, 3-8 mm, hard, mobile, subcutaneous nodules on the left shoulder, face, back, and abdomen,
Positive hepatomegaly, but no lymphadenopathy.

Laboratory: CBC was significant for anemia, with normal metabolic profile, LFTs, and prostate specific antigen. A colonoscopy performed 10 months prior was significant for one tubularadenoma. An infused computed tomography scan of the abdomen showed diffuse hypodensities in the liver suggestive of metastases. Extensive retroperitoneal symphadenopathy encasing the aorta and inferior vena cava was also seen, A single hyperdense nodule in the left lower lung field was also identified.
The patient was treated empirically for diarrhea, His condition deteriorated and died of septic shock 4 months after
presentation.
Histopathology: The biopsy shows a nodule composed of monomorphous small round cells with numerous apoptotic cells and rnitotic figures including atypical mitosis. The tumor was positive for antichromogranin and antisynaptophysin. Immunohistochemistry staining with AE1/AE3 anticytokeratin mixture strongly labeled the tumor in the dermis and subcutis. Anticytokeratin 20 labeled the tumor weakly positive at the edges. The tumor was negative for anticytokeratin 7.
Case 15 (27th Annual Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, 2003) METASTATIC CUTANEOUS CARCINOID
51 year-old black male with a 1 month history of multiple asymptomatic subcutaneous
nodules and a history of weight loss, diarrhea, hypertension, alcohol abuse, and liver masses.
