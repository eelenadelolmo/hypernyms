No pertinent findings on physical exam.
No treatment required unless symptomatic.
Fusion of the lower poles of the kidney by a band of functional renal parenchyma, seen extending across midline.  The kidneys are in a lower than expected location.
Horseshoe Kidney - Appearance is diagnostic.
Horseshoe kidney
Cross-fused ectopia
Pancake kidney
22 year-old asymptomatic female.  The patient does have a history of recurrent urinary tract infections.
Fusion of the lower poles of the kidneys occurred during development and the band of joining parenchyma is trapped under the Inferior Mesenteric Artery (IMA)on assent, preventing the kidneys from rising to their expected location in the upper abdomen in addition to maintaining them in an abnormal axis.  The vessel seen in cross-section immediately anterior to the adjoining band of renal parenchyma is the IMA.
