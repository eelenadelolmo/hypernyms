Texto: 
Physical examination reveals exquisite tenderness and nodularity of the thyroid.  ESR is elevated, T3 and T4 are elevated, and TSH is undetectable.
Radioiodine (I-131) uptake is 0.5% ( normal approx. 5-15% at 4 hours).  Thyroid imaging demonstrates near absent visualization of the thyroid gland ( uptake in the gland slightly greater than background counts) and a somewhat heterogenous pattern of uptake.
Subacute Thyroiditis
Disorders associated with low thyroid uptakes: 
  
* Subacute thyroiditis
* Medicines: thyroxine, glucocorticoids, phenylbutazone,     sulfonylureas
* Primary or secondary hypothyroidism
* Ectopic hormone production
* Ectopic Thyroid (lingual, substernal)
* Recent high dose of iodine (as in the setting of contrast-enhanced CT)
52 year old male patient with 1 month history of weight loss despite good appetite,  nervousness, tremors, and inability to sleep.  Symptoms followed an upper respiratory tract infection.
