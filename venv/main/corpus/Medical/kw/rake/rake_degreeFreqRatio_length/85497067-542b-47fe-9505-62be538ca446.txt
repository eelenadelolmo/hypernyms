WD Obese WF in NAD. SBP 220 mm Hg. Creatinine clearance was 29.
The patient was returned to the angiography suite. The right groin was prepped in meticulously sterile fasion. After infiltrating 1% lidocaine, ultrasound was used to localize the PSA and its neck. Using ultrasound guidance, 1 cc of a solution of 100 Unit/cc of thrombin was injected into the PSA oriented away from the neck. Real-time doppler exam revealed instantaneous thrombosis of the PSA.

The patient was discharged the following day. Her groin hematoma resolved, her renal function improved, and her bp is currently controlled on two agents.
CO2 and Gadolinium arteriograms demonstrate severe bilateral renal artery stenoses, right worse than left. Post-stent placement, there is marked improvement of the right renal artery stenosis.

Post-procedure doppler ultrasound of the access site demonstrates narrow neck of PSA with classic "yin-yang" appearance of inflow and outflow to PSA. 

Following thrombin injection, there is no flow in neck or PSA.

The patient is an 86 year old female with long standing hypertension which was not controlled with four agents. She was referred for evaluation of renal artery stenosis.

She underwent CO2 and Gadolinium arteriography of the aorta and right renal artery through a 6 French renal double curve sheath. A 5 mm balloon-expandable stent was deployed without difficulty after intravenous administration of 3,000 units heparin. 

The patient remained hyperetensive (SBP 220 mm Hg) throughout the case. ACT following stent palcement was 250 sec. and the sheath was left in place for another hour to allow values to drop below 200 sec. 

The sheath was removed in the recovery room, where it was noted that a small hematoma had formed in the right groin. Hemostasis was obtained with 20 minutes of manual compression. The patient remained flat with right leg straight for the remainder of the day.

The following morning, she was noted to have a moderate right groin hematoma. Ultrasound of the right common femoral artery was requested, and demonstrated a PSA of the access site.
This pateint has several risk factors for development of PSA, including obesity, ASPVD, hypertension, and anticoagulation. The angiographer must be prepared to treat complications associated with invasive procedures.
