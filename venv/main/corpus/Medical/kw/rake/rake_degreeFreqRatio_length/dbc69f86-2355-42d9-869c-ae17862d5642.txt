In coordination with imaging, the patient was treated with Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole for ascending cholangitis.  Blood cultures were negative, however infection likely pushed this patient with poor cardiac reserve in failure (note BNP).  Although suggested, a HIDA scan was not performed.  Following completion of treatment, ERCP is more likely to be tolerated with moderate sedation than cholecystectomy with general anesthesia.
US: Gallbladder sludge with multiple stones layers dependently, shows mobility with position change and does not have internal color flow.  Posterior shadowing from gallstones is present, but there is no gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid to suggest cholecystitis. There is common bile duct dilation which extends to the pancreatic head where an intramural stone is present.

85 year-old man with fever and RUQ pain.
The common scenario of an ER patient with RUQ from biliary colic, acute or chronic cholecystitis with an US request for evaluation can lull both technologists and radiologist into complacency.  We often accept exams which show little if any of the pancreas, let alone the CBD within the pancreatic head.  This case demonstrates the clinic impact of looking for and finding a CBD stone.  

Suggestions to maximize visualization include changes in patient positioning (including upright) and giving water to reduce gas artifact from the bowel.
