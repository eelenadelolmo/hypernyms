Provider reports diminished ability to infuse through Port and inability to aspirate.
After hand injected contrast run, which demonstrated catheter occlusion and contrast extravastaion, the Port-a-Cath was removed. Initially, presumably due to fibrosis from pericatheter inflammatory reaction from mechanical trauma and probable fibrosis from extravasated medications, the catheter could not be removed. After further adduction of the patient's arm, thereby decreasing the mechanical force from clavicle/ 1st rib appostion, the catheter was freed and successfully removed in one piece.
Portable Chest: Kinking of left subclavian Port-a-Cath catheter at insertion into mid left subclavian vein.

Hand injection contrast run thru Port-a-Cath: Occluded catheter at entry site into left subclavian vein at 1st rib/ clavicle junction. Extravastaion of contrast.
Pinch-off syndrome
Pinch-off syndrome
72 yo male with history of diffuse lymphoma, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
Pinch off syndrome is a known complication of mid subclavian insertion of central venous catheters. This is due to the mechanical forces of adjacent osseous structures on the catheter. Occluded flow and catheter fracture are frequent complications with resultant catheter breakdown. The feared compication, not seen in this case, is complete fracture and embolization of the tip. This is avoided with internal jugular vein access or careful access of the more peripheral segment of the subclavian vein.

When approaching this problem, complete, intact removal of the catheter is the goal. This should be done under fluoroscopic guidance after interrogation with contrast. If fracture is suspected then this should be done over a wire with careful planning for possible snare if fracture occurs.
