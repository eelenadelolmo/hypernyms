Right wrist exam: Edematous soft tissues overlying the radius and ulna. Non-erythematous, non-bruised, non-excoriated overlying skin.  Very limited range of motion in all directions.
Immobilized in a cast over the right arm and wrist for 6 weeks.
A-P, oblique and lateral radiographs of the wrist show  conminuted distal radial fracture with a 0.8 cm dorsal displacement of the distal radial fragment. The following measurements were within the normal range: Radial height 10.1 mm, Radial inclination 21 degrees, Ulnar variance 1 mm.  The fracture extends into the joint.
