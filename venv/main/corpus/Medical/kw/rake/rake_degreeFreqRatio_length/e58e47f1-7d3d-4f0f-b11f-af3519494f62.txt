Right wrist exam: Edematous soft tissues overlying the radius and ulna. Non-erythematous, non-bruised, non-excoriated overlying skin.  Very limited range of motion in all directions.
Immobilized in a cast over the right arm and wrist for 6 weeks.
A-P, oblique and lateral radiographs of the wrist show  conminuted distal radial fracture with a 0.8 cm dorsal displacement of the distal radial fragment. The following measurements were within the normal range: Radial height 10.1 mm, Radial inclination 21 degrees, Ulnar variance 1 mm.  The fracture extends into the joint.
Fracture of the distal radius
Distal radial fracture
This 28 yo woman who fell onto an outstretched right hand while walking on an icy sidewalk.  Pt reported severe, instantaneous wrist pain. Pt reported to the Emergency Room where the x-rays were taken.
