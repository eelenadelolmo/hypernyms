AP radiograph of the feet demonstrates features of chronic tophaceous gout to include nodular soft tissue prominence, well-marginated erosions of bone, overhanging edge at a site of erosion, and bony proliferations.

59 year old polynesian man with a history of gouty attacks presents for follow-up imaging.
General radiographic features during the acute attack of arthritis include transient soft tissue swelling about the involved joint or joints.  After years of intermittent episodic arthritis, chronic tophaceous gout may lead to permanent radiographic abnormalities.  

These permanent radiographic findings include nodular soft tissue prominence with or without calcifications, erosions of bone, bony proliferations, intra-osseous calcifications, and joint space narrowing in the late stage.

Bone erosions are produced by tophaceous deposits and may be intra-articular, para-articular, or located at a considerable distance form the joint.  Intra-articular erosions usually commence in the marginal areas of the joint and proceed centrally.  Para-articular erosions are eccentric in location and are frequently beneath soft tissue nodules.  Gouty erosions generally are surrounded by a sclerotic border, producing a “punched-out" appearance. 

In about 40% of patients with gouty erosions, an elevated bony margin or lip extends outward in the soft tissues, apparently covering the tophaceous nodules.  Although this appearance is not pathognomonic, it is strongly suggestive of gouty arthritis.
