No physical exam or laboratory findings available.
The patient was treated with a Whipple procedure.
US Findings:  The common bile duct measures 14mm with this pancreatic parenchymal tissue and pancreatic duct dilatation, measuring 5mm in diameter.  These findings were concerning for mucinous duct ecstatic pancreatic carcinoma vs. pancreatic head neoplasm.

CT findings:  A 23 x 21 mm heterogeneous mass is visualized within the head of the pancreas with moderate dilatation of the pancreatic duct as well as marked extra- and moderate intra-hepatic ductal dilatation.  The SMA and SMV fat planes appear preserved.
Pancreatic adenocarinoma, well-to-moderately differentiated.
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma
Mucinous duct ectatic pancreatic carcinoma
Lymphoma
Cholecystitis
60yo female with history of abdominal lymphoma presents to the ER with abdominal pain.
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma accounts for 3% of all cancers and is commonly unresectable at time of presentation giving an average survival time of 5-8 months.  When assessing the lesion radiographically, care must be taken to determine respectability, as surgery (i.e. Whipple procedure) is the only hope of cure.  

Sonographically, adenocarcinoma appears as a hypoechoic mass or just a subtle alteration of echotexture of the pancreas.  Biliary and pancreatic ductal dilatation can easily be identified and may be the only abnormality identified.  Characteristically, the dilated ducts will terminate into a hypoechoic mass.  If the portal vein, superior mesenteric artery, superior mesenteric vein, hepatic artery or celiac trunk are seen to be encased in tumor or involved with direct tumor invasion, the lesion is determined to be non-resectable.  Also, if liver or peritoneal metastases are identified, the lesion is not resectable. 

On CT, pancreatic adenocarcinoma appears as a hypodense mass distorting the contour of the pancreas with common bile duct and pancreatic duct dilatation and possible atrophy of the remaining pancreatic tissue.  Criteria for non-resectability on CT include extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, tumor involvement of adjacent organs, enlarged regional lymph nodes (>15mm), encasement or involvement of peripancreatic vessels, metastases in the liver, or peritoneal carcinomatosis.
