Current physical exam nonrevealing.
Treatment: Uncomplicated surgical resection. 

Pathology: Lung, left lower lobe, partial lobe resection. Lung parenchyma and pleura with mucus-filled cyst like bronchi, lymphoid hyperplasia, numerous pulmonary macrophages, thick-walled vessels, and fibrosis consistent with clinical history of pulmonary sequestration.
CXR:  The  mediastinal structures and pulmonary vascularity are normal in appearance.  Symmetric aeration is noted bilaterally.  Slight increased parenchymal opacity is noted in  the left lower lobe posteriorly.  Overlying bony thorax is unremarkable.

CT:  There is an area of increased lucency in the inferior left lower lobe, with multiple dilated abnormal blood vessels. The area is supplied predominantly by a large artery arising from the aorta just above the aortic hiatus. Drainage is to the left inferior pulmonary vein (not shown).
