palpable midline mass
Marginal excision, radiotherapy, and chemotherpay (doxyrubicin and cyclophosphamide)

Patient developed metastases to the liver within 2 years of primary treatment.
Axial and reformatted sagittal CT scans of the abdomen after oral and intraveous contrast show a large extraluminal mass with areas of low-attenuation mass with nodularity and large areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. On some images, the mass is adherent to the stomach and displaces surrounding viscera.
Synovial sarcoma-biphasic
Synovial sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma,metastatic disease, malignant fibrous histiocytoma sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, Burkitt lymphoma
Unfortunately this patient developed an uncommon soft tissue neoplasm in an atypical location, which progressed despite optimal surgical and medical management.
