Hypertension
Medical control of blood pressure.
CT demonstrates focal high density in the region of the left putamen. Contrast was administered due to apparent vasogenic edema on the preceding non-contrast examination. A follow-up MRI performed 3 months later demonstrates evidence of residual blood products in the same region. Note the decrease in mass effect on the follow-up study.
