Expected premature infant exam but o/w non-contributory.
A UVC is in place with the tip in the right portal vein.  A small luncency is seen around the tip of the catheter representing a small air pocket, introduced during placement of the catheter.  

A follow up image later that day shows correct position of the UVC with the tip just below the level of the diaphragm. 

A follow up 3 days later shows complete resolution of the small air collection.
