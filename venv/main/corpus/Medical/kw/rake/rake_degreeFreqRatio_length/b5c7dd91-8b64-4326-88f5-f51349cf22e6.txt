Physical exam reveal swelling of the dorsum of hand with TTP.
Pain control and immobilization.
An oblique fracture is present through the ulnar aspect of the third metacarpal which extends to the physis, consistent with a sprial Salter-Harris II fracture. There is minimal displacement of the fracture fragments, less than 2 mm at the midshaft. No other fractures are evident. Soft tissue structures are remarkable for
 extensive swelling on the dorsum of the hand.
