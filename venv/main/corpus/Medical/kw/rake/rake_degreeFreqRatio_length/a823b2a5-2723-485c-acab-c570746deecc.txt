Physical exam was notable for periumbilical tenderness with some radiation of pain bilaterally, the abdomen was soft without rebound or guarding and the physical exam was otherwise unremarkable.

Initial laboratory values were notable for albumin of 3.4, alk phos 310, AST 83, ALT 125, Total bilirubin 4.3, ESR 44, GGT 109. The patient was admitted for pain control and observation. 

The first day of admission the patient clinically worsened; he became febrile with increasing total bilirubin to 7.5 and right upper quadrant pain radiating to the right shoulder concerning for acute cholecystitis. The patient also developed apparent scleral icterus.
The patient then underwent ERCP with stone removal that revealed a purulent gallbladder and common bile duct. He is currently on antibiotics in anticipation of cholecystectomy following resolution of acute infection. 
After discharge he will be maintained on his home regimen of ursodiol, hydroxyzine, and lansoprazol as well as tramadol as needed for abdominal pain until seen by Gastroenterology.
The presentation ultrasound showed an enlarged common hepatic duct with patchy areas of increased echogenicity believed to represent fatty infiltration versus fibrosis.

CT imaging initially showed mild dilatation of the common bile duct and left intrahepatic bile duct with enhancement of the gallbladder wall and common bile duct suggestive of cholangitis. 

ERCP early on showed stricture formation in the bile ducts with the classic “beads on a string” appearance with dilation of the common bile duct. 

MRCP at  this presentation showed increased stricture formation at the proximal left branch, the cystic duct near junction with common hepatic duct, and diffuse narrowing of the common bile duct with more dilation of the common hepatic duct than previous MRCP. Imaging also showed stones present in the cystic duct proximal to the area of narrowing with sludge in the common hepatic duct proximal to the narrowed common bile duct. The gallbladder was found to be distended and thickwalled with a moderate amount of adjacent edema consistent with acute cholecystitis. Progression of the beaded appearance of the intrahepatic bile ducts was also demonstrated.
Acute cholecystitis in the setting of primary sclerosing cholangitis
• Primary sclerosing cholangitis
• Secondary sclerosing cholangitis:  ascending cholangitis as  result of strictures, stones, or bile duct anomalies
• Cholangiocarcinoma
This 18 year old man presented 2 years prior to his primary care physician with complaints of abdominal pain, fatigue, and dizziness and was diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis. The patient did well with an appropriate medication regimen and frequent GI follow up until approximately 2 years after diagnosis when he presented with fatigue, diarrhea, and abdominal pain - unrelieved by tramadol.
The patient was diagnosed with PSC based on initial imaging findings, laboratory values, and liver biopsy results showed mild chronic inflammation of the portal tract without evidence of sclerosing Acute cholecystitis was diagnosed with imaging, laboratory values and clinical examination findings.
