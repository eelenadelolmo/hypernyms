Texto: 
Decreased breath sounds in the bases.  No fever or leukocytosis.
Patient was admitted for anticoagulation.  Given unexpected findings, a work up for hypercoagulability must be performed.
Radiograph:  Right basilar, lingular, left lower lobe air space disease.  Peripherally based wedge shaped opacity in the left costophrenic angle.  Left pleural effusion.

CT:  Intraluminal filling defects of the pulmonary arteries to the lingula, lower lobes, and right middle lobe.  Peripheral wedge-shaped opacities in the lower lobes.  Left pleural effusion.
Pulmonary Thromboembolism
CR DDX:
Infarct from pulmonary embolism

Septic emboli
41 year old white male with history of flank pain 2 weeks prior.  Diagnosed with a right lower lobe pneumonia by primary care provider and treated with antibiotics.  Presented to Emergency Medicine with dyspnea on exertion while recovering from pneumonia.
Patient had presented for dyspnea on exertion.  The prior CT (not shown) demonstrated a peripheral opacity in the right lower lobe.  Subsequent radiographs from an outside institution described a right lower lobe consolidation and patient was subsequently treated.

The concerning factor for this case was the left lower lobe air space disease and peripherally based opacity in the left costophrenic angle that has been described as a "Hampton's Hump" in the setting of pulmonary thromboembolic disease.

A CT pulmonary angiogram was recommended by the radiologist despite the clinical concern for infection and tuberculosis.

Radiographic findings for thromboemoblic disease are nonspecific but when there is a discordance between clinical course and radiographic findings, this diagnosis must be included in the differential diagnosis.
