Multiple purple cutaneous lesions
Supportive
Moderate enhancement of pial surface right hemisphere consistent with leptomeningeal angiomatosis.

Diffuse enlargment of medullary and convexity veins over right cerebral hemisphere and left cerebellar hemisphere.  Marked enlargement of central venous sinuses.

The affected right hemisphere is actually smaller - this is easier to demonstrate by measuring the diameter.

Normal arteries on MRA brain
