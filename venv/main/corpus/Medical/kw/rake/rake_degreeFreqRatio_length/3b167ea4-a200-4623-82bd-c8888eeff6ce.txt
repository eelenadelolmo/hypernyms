Vitals: Pulse ox w/ desats to mid-80s w/ exertion; HEENT: Multiple facial angiofibromas, gingival fibromas, multiple hypomelanotic macules, no LAD; CV: RRR; Lungs: CTAB but diminished breath sounds bilaterally; Skin: Confetti lesions x4 extremities; Shagreenâ€™s patch on back, subungual fibromas
She will follow up w/ her pulmonologist every 6 months w/ PFTs and CT to monitor progression of her pulmonary disease; there is currently no treatment for her disease aside from symptomatic relief. Hormone replacement and manipulation with progesterone and luteinizing hormone analogs with or without oophorectomy have been tried but without demonstrated efficacy. Lung transplantation may also be considered as pulmonary involvement of TS usually carries a poor prognosis, with progressive disease and death secondary to respiratory insufficiency within 5 years.
CXR: Left and probable R lung surgery w/ hyperinflation and scattered bilateral increased lung markings c/w lymphangioleiomyomatosis; no definite evidence of pneumothorax.  
CT (Chest): severe cystic changes in lungs w/ no evidence of PTX or effusion. 
Prior CT (Abd, pelvis): numerous bilateral fatty lesions w/in kidneys c/w angiomyolipoma; multiple nonfatty angiomyolipomas bilaterally; enlarged lymph node in L iliac chain; cystic structure adjacent to the uterus on L, which may represent a retroperitoneal lymphangioma vs an enlarged L ovary w/ cyst; inhomogenous enhancement of the uterus which is also enlarged c/w fibroids; multiple osteoblastic foci w/in the vertebral bodies â€“ study unavailable
Prior MRI: periventricular calcifications â€“ study unavailable
Tuberous sclerosis w/ pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)
Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM); phakomatoses (neurocutaneous syndromes) including tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, Sturge Weber disease, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, and ataxia telangiectasia; emphysema, Langerhansâ€™ cell histiocytosis (eosinophilic granuloma); lymphangioleiomyomatosis; interstitial pulmonary fibrosis; sarcoidosis; pulmonary lymphangiectasis; Diffuse pulmonary lymphangiomatosis, lymphangiomas; uterine leiomyosarcoma w/ lung mets; benign metastasizing uterine leiomyomata; mesenchymal cystic hamartoma of the lung; multiple pulmonary fibroleiomyomatosis hamartomas (very rare)
36 y/o female w/ a history of complex partial seizures since childhood and two episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax in the last year treated w/ drainage pleurodesis/ pleurectomy reports continued dyspnea on exertion. She currently takes no medications and has no family history of any problems.
Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic neurocutaneous disorder that is autosomal dominant in the one-third of familial cases or either due to spontaneous mutation or mosaicism in non-familial cases. The defect is in the TSC1 (chromosome 9) and TSC2 (chromosome 16p) genes, which code for the proteins hamartin and tuberin respectively, although the functions of these proteins are as yet unknown. TS manifests with multi-organ involvement, with dermatologic features including hypopigmented lesions (ash-leaf spots) and connective tissue nevi (Shagreen patch), and CNS involvement including periventricular calcifications and seizure disorders, often with severe learning difficulties, mental retardation, and autism. Pulmonary manifestions often show an obstructive pattern on PFTs with interstitial disease with cystic changes on radiographs and CT that are indistinguishable from lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). It predominantly affects females in the fourth decade, often presenting with dyspnea from spontaneous pneumorthorax in up to a third, chronic cough, and/or wheezing with chest pain and can lead to cyanosis, cor pulmonale, and death from respiratory failure.
