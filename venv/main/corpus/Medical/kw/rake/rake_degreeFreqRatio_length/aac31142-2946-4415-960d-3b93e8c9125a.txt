Intestinal Non-Rotation
34 y/o Caucasian female presented to the Emergency Room with acute right lower quadrant pain.  CT requested to rule out appendicitis.
Intestinal non-rotation, although commonly called malrotation, represents an abnormal arrest of the midgut rotation after the first 90 degrees of rotation.  At this point the pre-arterial midgut lies to the right of the superior mesenteric artery and the post-arterial limb to the left.  The post-arterial limb is then first to return to the abdomen.  Consequently it lies in the left hemiabdomen.  The returning pre-arterial segment is forced to remain on the right.  Both segments continue to share a common dorsal mesentery, which lies in the midline.  This allows considerable mobility of both the small and large bowel and predisposes to midgut volvulus.
