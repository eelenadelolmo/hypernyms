PE: Pt with no pain over lateral foot, including boney palpation of lateral structures.  Was quite TTP over TMTJ on Hallux side of foot.
Excision of accessory navicular bone, and pinning of stress fracture in navicular bone.
Plain radiographs of R Foot:  Consistent with presence of accessory  navicular bone, articulating with navicular tubercle.  Also, sclerotic changes are present in navicular bone near articulation with talus.
Bone Scan:  Increased radiotracer uptake in R navicular bone, as well as R 4th metatarsal
CT Scan: confirmed presence of accessory navicular bone, as well as sclerotic changes of navicular bone.
Type III Accessory Navicular Bone
Fracture of True Navicular Bone
Accessory Navicular Bone
Multiple Stress Fracture of Foot
Pt is a 23 y/o AA female varsity athlete who presented initially with complaint of right foot pain.  No pertinent medical history.
This patient had two possible causes of her pain.  First, her stress fracture in the navicular bone can certainly cause pain.  Also, the presence of an accessory navicular bone could have provided an alternate source of attachment for the posterior tibial tendon.  The surgeon thought it was prudent to correct both possible areas to ensure no further problems in the future.
