Surgical resection
On the frontal radiograph, a round opacity results in a prominent right hilum.
On CT, a SPN sits in the right middle lobe adjacent to the right heart.
Carcinoid tumor
Prior to CT:  confluence of shadows, OGD, bronchogenic carcinoma, solitary met, hamartoma, AVM, rounded atelectasis.

After CT:  bronchogenic carcinoma, met, carcinoid
No relevant history provided
Clinical features such as patient age, history of prior malignancy, presenting symptoms, and smoking history can be helpful.  Morphologic evaluation of the size, margins, contour, and internal characteristics of a solitary pulmonary nodule with conventional imaging techniques is often unreliable in differentiating benign from malignant nodules.  That being said, popcorn, central, and concentric calcification suggests benignancy, as does the presence of small satellite lesions (OGD), feeding and draining vessels (AVM), or the presence of fat (hamartoma).  Spiculation, invasion, pleural retraction, and necrosis suggest malignancy. 

This tumor, arising near the hilum, is in the typical location for a carcinoid.
