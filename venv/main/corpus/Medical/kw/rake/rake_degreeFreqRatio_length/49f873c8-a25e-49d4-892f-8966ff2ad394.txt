Bilateral striated nephrograms, L>R:
wedge shaped areas of decreased enhancement compared to normal renal parenchyma with associated perinephric fat stranding indicating areas of edema and inflammation in the kidneys.

• Acute Pyelonephritis
• Lobar nephronia
• Distal obstruction
• Tubular obstruction

• Renal vein thrombosis
21 yo Female with fever, hypotension and flank pain.
Acute pyelonephritis is caused by bacterial infection that has ascended from the lower urinary tract or,  by hematogenous spread.  Antibiotics typically make this disease easily managed; however, complications may occur.

Pyelonephritis becomes a potentially fatal disease when secondary conditions develop, such as emphysematous pyelonephritis (20-80% mortality rate), perinephric abscess (20-50% mortality rate), or one of the sepsis syndromes (>25% overall mortality rate). 

CT is generally used in the evaluation of pyelonephritis to asses for complications.  Long term complications include renal scarring and potentially decreased renal function if repetitive infections occur.  The most common pathogen is E. coli (70-80%).  Others include Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
