Return to Ophthalmology clinic in AM for reevaluation.
Extensive soft tissue swelling of the right eyelid which is limited to the region anterior to the orbital septum.

There is no evidence of orbital, retro-orbital or intracranial abscess. Structures within the posterior fossa and supratentorial space are developmentally normal. There is no mass, mass effect or acute intracranial hemorrhage. 

Pneumatized portions of the skull are otherwise remarkable for minimal right ethmoid sinus disease.

While imaging can exclude orbital, retro-orbital or intracranial abscess, the physical exam and labs are necessary to differentiate between a cellulitis and allergic swelling.
