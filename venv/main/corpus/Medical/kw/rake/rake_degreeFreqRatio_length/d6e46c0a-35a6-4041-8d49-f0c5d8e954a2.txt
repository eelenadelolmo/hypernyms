• Mass is hyperintense to brain on both T2 and FLAIR
• The lesion does not enhance
Juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma
• Medullobastoma
• Ependymoma
• Choroid Plexus papilloma
• Astrocytoma
14 year old girl with a one year history of frontal headaches.
A CT scan, done elsewhere, demonstrated a posterior fossa lesion.  Most (2/3) of pilocytic astrocytoma show a prominent fluid collection.  Most pilocytic astrocytomas show bright contrast enhancement; however, this case  is unusual, because the tumor does not enhance.

While some pilocytic astrocytomas show reactive - rather than neoplastic - enhancement, this one showed neither.
