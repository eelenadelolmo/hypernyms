Liver edge palpable to 4 cm below ribcage on exam.
Although the patient had used Tamoxifen in the past, she was considered to be chemotherapy naive. Due to systemic dissemination of disease it was decided to attempt chemotherapy first and reserve radiation therapy as a palliative option.
Multiple liver lesions replacing approximately 80% of liver volume. Multiple lesions of brain parenchyma in bilateral parietooccipital regions with diffuse enhancement of overlying skull and dura.
Metastatic ductal carcinoma (breast)
Metastatic disease - Melanoma
Metastatic disease - Ductal Breast CA
60 year old woman with PMH of T1bN0M0 breast CA and melanoma, both 9 years ago. S/P lumpectomy, XRT, Tamoxifen, local excision. Presents with 3 months of early satiety and nausea. Additional complaint of blurred vision when looking to her left while driving for 1 week.
This is a rather unfortunate case of a woman who was concurrently diagnosed with stage I breast cancer and melanoma 8 years ago. Neither disease demonstrated pathologic lymph node involvement at time of initial diagnosis / treatment. Sadly she now demonstrates diffuse metastasis of pathologically proven ductal carcinoma involving approximately 80% of her liver, her parietooccipital brain parenchyma and overlying skull and meninges, as well as the body of her L4 vertebrae.
