Texto: 
Decreased hearing right ear, otherwise negative.
Gamma knife therapy with targeting of meningoma only.
â€¢ Large right cerebellar lesion with a striated non-enhancing mass like appearance

â€¢ Smaller cerebellopontine angle mass extending into the right cavernous sinus
Lhermitte Duclos and Cerebellopontine Angle Meningioma
Large lesion:
â€¢ Medullobastoma
â€¢ Cerebellar Infarct
â€¢ Gangliocytoma
â€¢ Astrocytoma
â€¢ Lhermitte-Duclos Disease

Anterior Lesion:
â€¢ Schwannoma (e.g. Trigeminal)
â€¢ Meningioma
66 year old farmer with longstanding hearing loss right ear
1. Association of Lhermitte Duclos and meningioma is very rare.  

2.The hearing loss is probably due extension of the dysplastic cerebellum into the right ICA with stretching of the 8th CN.  
The meningioma does not appear to extend into the right internal auditory canal.
