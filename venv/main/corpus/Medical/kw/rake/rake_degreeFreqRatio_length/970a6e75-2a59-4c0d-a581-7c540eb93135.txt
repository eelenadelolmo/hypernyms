Physical exam not available at time of imaging
- Calcified subependymal nodules in lateral ventricles
- Low density cortical tubers
- Pulmonary "honeycomb" pattern suggestive of Lymphangiomyomatosis (LAM)
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (with this constellation of features).  Subependymal gray matter heterotopia does not calcify like this; and, other causes of periventricular Ca++ cause volume loss and do not protrude into ventricle.
13 y/o girl with Hx of seizures since childhood
This specific case is interesting for the fact that the patient also had  pulmonary lymphangiomyomatosis.  Lymphangiomyomatosis is a pulmonary condition in which there is infiltration of smooth muscle in the interstitium that leads to cystic changes throughout the lung parenchyma.  One source suggests that this process occurs in less than 10% of all TSC patients (2).  Treatment goals are geared toward preserving lung tissue.  Patients usually undergo serial CT scans to monitor the disease process.
