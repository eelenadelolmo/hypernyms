Control blood pressure using captopril 6.25mg po tid as tolerated by patient.   Monitor renal function closely. Once blood pressure is controlled, transfer patient to UCSF for surgical intervention using aorta to aortic bifurcation bypass graft. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty has been proven unsuccessful for long term treatment due to incidents of restenosis.
There is a focal narrowing of the mid-abdominal aorta. The point of maximal narrowing is at the region of the renal artery origins. This focal narrowing measures approximately 3mm in diameter, compared to 9mm in diameter of the proximal abdominal aorta. This represents approximately 66% stenosis. The distal aorta is also narrowed until it bifurcates in an abnormally superior location, at the level of L3. 
Additionally, there is focal narrowing at the origins of both renal arteries with post- stenotic dilatation. There is also focal narrowing of the proximal celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. The celiac artery demonstrates post stenotic dilation with a large gastroduodenal to right abdominal to right iliac collateral loop. There is an apparent arc of Roland branch off of the SMA that reconstitutes the IMA. The splenic artery is normal. There are multiple other collateral arteries to include the inferior epigastric and lateral abdominal arteries, which reconstitute the iliac vessels. The solid organs of the abdomen to include the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, kidneys, spleen, and adrenal glands, are all normal in appearance.
Midaortic Syndrome
Differential Diagnosis: 
1.	Takayasu’s disease
2.	Aortitis
3.	Congenital coarctation
4.	Alagille syndrome
5.	Aortic hypoplasia
6.	Fibromuscular dysplasia
7.	Neurofibromatasis I
5 years old Asian female recently diagnosed with hypertension secondary to mid-aorta syndrome. The patient was air-evacuated from Masowa, Japan to TAMC for evaluation by pediatric cardiologist. The patient otherwise has been asymptomatic without any complaints of headache, abdominal pain, or blurred vision. The patient’s hypertension was discovered during a visit to the local emergency room where staff noticed increased blood pressure during physical exam. Serial blood pressures were taken every ? hour resulted in an average blood pressure well above normal.
