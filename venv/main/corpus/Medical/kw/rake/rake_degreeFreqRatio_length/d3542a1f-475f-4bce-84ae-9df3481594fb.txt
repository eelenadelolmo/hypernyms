Normal exam.
None, this is a "do not touch" lesion.
Radiographs demonstrate a cortically based area of subtle sclerosis along the medial supracondylar ridge.
Periosteal Desmoid
n/a
19 year- old male with incidental finding on knee radiograph obtained following minor trauma.
Typically seen in patients aged 3-20 years, a periosteal desmoid is thought to arise following repeat microtrauma producing what is also termed a "tug" lesion.   When seen earlier, this entity may appear as a saucer- shaped cortical lucency with mild periosteal reaction.  Periosteal desmoid's often "heal" by the late teens to early twenties.  The lesion in this case is likely late in it's evolution.
