Proptosis right eye associated with vascular mass
Conservative management
• Infiltrative mass producing proptosis right eye and enlargement of the orbit.
• Mass envelopes optic nerve and  extra-ocular muscles.
• Lesion is hypointense to fat on T1 images, and isointense to fat on T2 images.
• Mass enhances fairly homogeneously.  No invasion of surrounding structures.
Orbit,  hemangioma
• Lymphangioma
• Lymphoma
• Rhabdomyosarcoma
