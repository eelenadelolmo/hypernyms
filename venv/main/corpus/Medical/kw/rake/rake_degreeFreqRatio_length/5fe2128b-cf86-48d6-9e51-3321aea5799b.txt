Unremarkable exam.
Reassurance - No specific followup indicated.
There is no fracture, subluxation or dislocation. Incidental note is made of a well circumscribed oval density within the lateral femoral metaphysis that measures 1.4 cm (AP) x 3.8 cm (superior to inferior) x 1.8 cm (medial to lateral). There is no endosteal scalloping or cortical expansion. Bone mineralization is otherwise normal. Within the lateral compartment of the knee joint there is a small quantity of gas suggestive of vacuum phenomenon associated with early degenerative change. Visualized soft tissues are remarkable for large body habitus.

48 yo female with left lateral knee pain worse with flexion.  Patient reports she hit the knee on a dashboard during a MVC 8 months ago.
Ossified fibroxanthomas also known as 'healed' non-ossifying fibromas are a relatively common incidental finding on plain radiographs acquired for a different purpose.  Correct identification is important to avoid unneccessary workup.
