Treatment of craniosynostosis is primarily surgical.  These infants are usually operated on early in their life. Patients with metopic craniosynostosis are treated prior to sixth months of age.

Factors that may necessitate earlier treatment are increasing intracranial pressure and corneal exposure secondary to exorbitism.

The procedure to correct symmetric craniosynostosis (as in this case) involves fracturing the bone parallel to the affected suture.  A synthetic material graft is placed between the bone and the new “suture” that helps delay fusion.

3.5 month-old baby girl with an abnormally shaped, large head, and prominent scalp veins.
Craniosynostosis is the early fusion of one or more of the cranial sutures.  In this case, the patient’s metopic suture has fused early, resulting in trigonocephaly.

The incidence of craniosynostosis in newborns is approximately .4 per 1000 and less than 10% of these involve the metopic suture.

Metopic craniosynostosis usually only has cosmetic consequences, and the patients usually have normal intellectual development.

This condition is usually idiopathic, but there are other varieties of craniosynostosis that are components of syndromes.
