A mass is present in the left side of the face immediately inferior and anterior to the left maxillary sinus which demonstrates well
defined margins with non-aggressive features. It is isointense on T1, hyperintense on T2 with homogeneous enhancement with Gadolinium. Additionally,
on the T2-weighted images, there are  flow voids along the posterior lateral aspect of the mass.
Hemangioma, soft-tissue
Given the imaging findings in this case, the likely diagnosis is hemangioma.
Facial swelling over sinuses for one month with swollen left check with leaning forward.
