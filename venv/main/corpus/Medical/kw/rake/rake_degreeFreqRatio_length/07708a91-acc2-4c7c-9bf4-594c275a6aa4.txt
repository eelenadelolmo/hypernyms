The modified PIOPED criteria is generally accepted as the standard for interpretaion of the V/Q scan.  A high probability scan V/Q scan is defined as a scan with two or more large mismatched segmental defects.  A low probability V/Q scan is defined as a scan with non-segmental perfusion defects, or matched ventilation and perfusion defects.  A normal V/Q scan is defined as a scan with no perfusion defects. An intermediate V/Q scan is defined as an abnormal scan that does not meet the criteria for either low or high probability scan.
