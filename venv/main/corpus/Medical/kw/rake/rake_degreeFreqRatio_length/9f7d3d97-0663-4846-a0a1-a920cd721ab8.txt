• Meningioma
49 year old woman with headaches.  Investigated by CT and chest radiographs.
The CT scan was initially interpreted as meningioma by the on call resident.  This high density lesion was thought to be due to tissue calcification rather than blood.  The lesion location, high parietal region, makes the differentiation between and intraaaxial vs. extra-axial location more difficult. Even the sagittal MR scans suggest meningioma, with a hemispheric shape broad-based on the skull.
