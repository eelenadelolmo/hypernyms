Texto: 
Patient had non-specific abdominal pain for the last 3 months.  Patient did not have any signs of infection and the physical exam was normal except for some diffuse abdominal tenderness.
Surgical follow up was recommended with referral to a urologist for consultation.
CT scan with contrast showed an incidental finding of a complex renal cyst.  This was evaluated as a Bosniak Class 3 renal cyst.
Classic Bosniak Class III complex renal cyst
• Renal cell carcinoma
• Benign complex cyst
• Oncocytoma (usually solid)
• Abscess
• Multilocular Cystic Nephroma (MLCN)
61 year old woman complains of non-specific abdominal pain.
Within most of the literature discussing Bosniak classification of complex renal cysts, Class 3 cysts have been consistently diagnosed post-surgery as renal cell carcinoma or other cancer.  So all diagnosed class 3 cysts should be referred for surgical evaluation.
