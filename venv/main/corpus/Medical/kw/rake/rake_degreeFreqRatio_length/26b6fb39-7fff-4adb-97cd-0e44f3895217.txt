PHYSICAL EXAM:	1.4 cm by 1.5 cm exophytic soft dome- shaped subcutaneous mass with shiny intact epidermis,
overlying the inferolateral aspect of the left patella. No limitation of the range of motion of the knee was noted. 
 HISTOPATHOLOGY: Well-defined, unencapsulated lobulated mass in the dermis composed of stellate and spindle cells with pale indistinct cytoplasm in a myxoid stroma with thin fibrovascular septa.
Complete excision was performed. There has been no evidence of recurrence to date.
