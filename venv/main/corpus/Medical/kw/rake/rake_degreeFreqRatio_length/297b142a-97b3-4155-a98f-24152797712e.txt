Texto: 
Palpable firm nodules/densities in both lower extremities superior to the knee.  Full ROM, no visible deformity.
No treatment unless the exostoses are causing physical pain or other symptoms secondary to mass effect.  Imaging follow-up with MRI to assess thickness of the cartilaginous cap as necessary, especially if rapid growth (should be stable after physeal closure).
Multiple osseous projections from the both medial and lateral femur, long axis oriented away from the joint.  Medullary caivites in continuity with the femur medullary space.  On MRI, no significant thickening of the cartilaginous cap to suggest malignant degeneration.
Multiple Hereditary Exostosis
Multiple exostoses.  Imaging findings classic.
18 y.o white female presented for knee pain, no significant past medical or family history.  No recent trauma.
Generally (2/3) autosomal dominant passage, Significantly greater frequency in patients from Guam/Mariana islands, which means more are seen in the Navy (this patient was not a Guam native).
