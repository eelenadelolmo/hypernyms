The treatment of choice for schistomiasis (regardless of species) is praziquantel (Biltricide). Dose varies depending on the species present.  Schistosomes are typically viable for 5-7 years but may live as long as 30 years. To follow the progress of treatment check stool 6 weeks after treatment or use antigen detection test to  quantitate extent of infection. This particular patient is at  ******  so no specific data was available for follow-up.
