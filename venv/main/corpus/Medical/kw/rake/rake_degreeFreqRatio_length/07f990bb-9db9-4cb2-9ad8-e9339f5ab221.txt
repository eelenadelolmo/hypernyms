ENT Surgery and Imaging as needed
Axial and coronal paranasal sinus bone CT shows remodeling of the lateral right maxillary sinus wall.  The lateral right maxillary sinus wall is thinned and barely perceptible.  Chronic mucosal membrane inflammatory change is noted in the right maxillary sinus with an air fluid level.   There is a defect in the bony floor of the right maxillary sinus, best viewed on the coronal images, that communicates with the alveolar margin.  A soft tissue mass and a few small air bubbles fill the oral antral communication.
Oral Antral Fistula
Infection, Tumor, Developmental or Granulomatous Disease
35-year-old female with persistent right facial pain.  The patient has a history of right upper molar extraction, six months prior.
The most common cause of an oral antral fistula is tooth extraction. Maxillary first molars extractions (tooth #3 or #14) account for 50% of oral antral fistulas caused by oral surgery. Maxillary second molar (tooth #2 or #15), and third molar (tooth #1 or #16), extractions account for the other 50%. 

The etiology for development of an oral antral communication with the maxillary sinus is not always clear, but several factors have been reported to increase the risk of this developing one at the time of tooth extraction or wisdom teeth surgery. These include:  a) Infected tooth, b) Difficult extractions, c) Long standing molars, and d) The tip of the root crossed over the bottom line of the maxillary sinus.   Rothamel et al concluded that intraoperative fracture of the root, higher degree of impaction and higher age of the patient are associated with a greater likelihood of oral antral perforation. 

Review of the medical and dental literature identifies multiple case reports apropos other causes or predisposing conditions for oral antral fistula formation such as:  HIV-associated periodontal disease, Paget's disease, maxillary sinus fusariosis, Wegener's granulomatosis, and multiple myeloma.  Other causes include tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, neoplasms, phycomycoses, midline granuloma, and developmental clefts. 
 
Treatment of oral antral fistulas is typically conservative such as treating the sinus disease in hopes of spontaneous closure.  Simple observation or normal saline flushes are used if an oral antral communication is identified at the time of surgery.  Typically, an oral antral communication does not require surgery for definitive treatment if it recognized at the time of surgery.  If surgery is needed, a fistula excision is performed followed by closure with a buccal mucoperiosteal flap.  Long-term successful closure of oral antral fistulas depends on the technique used, the size and location of the defect, and on the presence or absence of sinus disease.
