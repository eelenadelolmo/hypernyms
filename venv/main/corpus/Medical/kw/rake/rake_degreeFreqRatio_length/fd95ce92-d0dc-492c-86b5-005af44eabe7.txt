Alert and oriented with generalized, nonspecific, tenderness in the suprapubic, epigastric and left flank region. No rebound tenderness. Sluggish bowel sounds 

Temperature 36.5 C, BP 133/85, BUN 17, creatinine 0.8, sodium 129, potassium 4.3, chloride 95, CO2 19.6, calcium 9.2, urine culture with greater than 100,00 colonies of Escherichia coli and1+ budding yeast. WBC of 17,000 with 7 bands. Serum glucose 529
IV antiobiotic (Gentamicin and Ceftazidime), nephrostomy drainage tube placed with purulent discharge.
CT without contrast: Bilateral renal cysts due to ADPKD; air within the swollen left kidney capsule with necrotic parenchymal tissue; right kidney otherwise appeared normal.
Emphysematous Pyelonephritis
Acute pyelonephritis, Emphysematous pyelonephritis, Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, Renal abscess, Emphysematous pyelitis (gas in collecting system but not in parenchyma)
Poorly controlled type I diabetic with history of polycystic kidney disease and hypertension presents to ED with left flank pain, history of fevers, decreased p.o. intake with large amounts of green emesis.  Patient with urine ouput 4-5 times per day with some dysuria but no increased frequency or urgency.  Of note, patient was in the ED two days prior with similar symptoms and treated/discharged with diagnosis of probable nephrolithiasis.  No antibiotics treatment was administered at the time. However,urine culture obtained at that time subsequently grew Escherichia coli.  Patient returned to ED with worsening symptoms.
