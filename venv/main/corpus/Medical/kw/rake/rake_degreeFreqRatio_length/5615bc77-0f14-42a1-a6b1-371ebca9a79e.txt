Penetrating injury just under right ear.
After one year, no complaints and the marine is performing well in active duty.
Grenade fragment lodged in right transverse foramina of the vertebrae.
Grenade fragment stable in transverse foramina of the vertebrae
Grenade fragment to right transverse foramina of the vertebrae
22 y.o. otherwise healthy marine from Fallujah, Iraq during major firefight. Grenade went off in confined area.
It would be wise to flag the medical record of this marine with precaution to MRI; given the location in the transverse foramina. Since there was no evidence of damage to the vertebral artery, there was no need for an angiogram.
