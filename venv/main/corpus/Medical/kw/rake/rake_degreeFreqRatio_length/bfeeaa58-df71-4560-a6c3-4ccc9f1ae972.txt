Diffuse expiratory wheezing
• bronchodilators
• steroids
Hyperinflated lungs with flattening of hemidiaphragms and increased AP diameter
Asthma with air trapping
• Reactive airway disease (asthma)
• Viral illness with diffuse air trapping
Wheezing, no fever
• Reactive airway disease and viral illness can have similar features to include bronchial wall thickening (cuffing and tram-tracks), hyperinflation from air trapping (partial bronchial obstruction), and atelectasis (areas of complete bronchial obstruction; ie: mucous plugging)
• Airblock phenomena are more likely in asthmatic patients, to include pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax
