Rhinolith
• Rhinolith
• Osteoma
57 y.o. with a sensation of "blocked" right nose 15 years
Serosanguinous discharge - right nose 10 years

Since the mass was huge, removal through the nasal cavity could traumatize the nasal mucosa.  Hence, a lateral rhinotomy was done and the rhinolith was removed safely.
