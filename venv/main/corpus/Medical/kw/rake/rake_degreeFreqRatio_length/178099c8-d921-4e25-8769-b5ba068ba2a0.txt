In the initial CT image, a very large soft tissue mass is seen in the anterior abdomen, growing under surgical mesh at the site of previous surgical intervention.  A CT scan 7 months later is normal.  Six months later, a new soft tissue mass is seen arising in the right rectus abdominis.  The left rectus abdominis is also expanded in the final image, indicating a probable new mass as well.
