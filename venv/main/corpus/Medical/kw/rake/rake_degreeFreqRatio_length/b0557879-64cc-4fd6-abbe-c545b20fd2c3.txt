Orthopedic consultation was recommended.
Plain film: film shows anatomic alignment without fracture.  Ill-defined sclerosis is seen in the lateral aspect of the metadiaphysis of the proximal tibia. Osteophytosis is seen in the medial femoral condyle and patella.

NM scan (25.3 mCi of Tc-99m MDP IV): There is moderate, focal uptake in the region of the plain film abnormality. No other areas of abnormal radiopharmaceutical uptake.

MR: Lesion within the lateral proximal tibia in a metadiaphyseal location measures 8 cm in greatest dimension. Ill-defined borders. Lateral cortex appears intact and may or may not be involved with the lesion. Some new bone formation may be present. Lesion has low T1, low T1 fat-sat, high T2 and some enhancement heterogeneously in the lesion.

CT: There is an anterolateral, cortically based sclerotic lesion extending into the anteromedial medullary space, with whispy margins and note
of serpiginous lucencies running through it.   There is no evidence of cortical destruction or fracture or fibular involvement or soft tissue involvement.   There is no significant periosteal change.   This
lesion involves the anterolateral metaphysis and proximal diaphysis of the left tibia.
Osseous hemangioma - The CT correlation with recent MRI showing serpiginous contrast enhancement within the cortically based lesion and the constellation of CT findings is most consistent with a cortically based osseous hemangioma.
fibrous dysplasia
metastatic carcinoma
infection
chondroid tumors
