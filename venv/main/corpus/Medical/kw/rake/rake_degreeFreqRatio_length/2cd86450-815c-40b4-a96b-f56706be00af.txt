Numerous non movable, non tender, subcutaneous, hard nodules found on the mandible and maxilla.  The remainder of the physical examination was normal.  There were no pertinent laboratory studies.
Surgical removal of the osteomas with continued physical examination surveillance.
Axial and 3D reconstructed images of the skull showing numerous osteomas over the mandible and maxilla.
Gardner's Syndrome
Soft tissue calcifications
Osteomas
Idiopathic osteosclerosis
Fibrous dysplasia
Sclerosing osteomyelitis
The patient is a 24 year old male who has a family history significant for known familial adenomatous polyposis.  He has been followed closely by a gastroenterologist and primary care physician and underwent a partial colectomy at age 20.  
	Beginning at age 21 he began to notice hard nodules underlying the skin in the temporal and parietal regions of the skull and along the mandible.  These nodules were non movable but  tender.  There were no visible changes to the overlying skin or change in sensation.  The patient denies any trauma, fever or weight loss.
	His past medical and surgical history are significant only for the aforementioned familial adenomatous polyposis and partial colectomy.  He is currently not taking any medications, vitamins or herbal supplements.  He works as an accountant at a local manufacturer, is unmarried and has no children.  The patient has a 2 pack year history of cigarette use and drinks alcohol occasionally.  He is an only child and has a family history significant for familial adenomatous polyposis, diabetes and hypertension.  An abbreviated review of systems was remarkable only for the tender head nodules and occasional loose stools.
While the osteomas normally precede presentation of colonic polyposis, this patient had undergone partial colectomy prior to the manifestation of skeletal findings.      

Aside from the temporal relationship to his colonic pathology, this patient’s presentation of the ostoemas associated with Gardner’s Syndrome was rather typical.
