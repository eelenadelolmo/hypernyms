Serial radiographs as a means to track the progression/regression of the ossification.  Cold compresses, ice, elevation, and immobilization to treat symptoms.
Initial A-P radiograph of the left hip shows pinning of the left femoral fracture and indistinct flocculent calcifications in the lateral quadriceps musculature. A-P radiograph of the left hip three weeks later shows that the ossifications in the lateral quadriceps musculature is better defined.
Myositis ossificans
Myositis ossificans

Extraskeletal chondrosarcoma or osteosarcoma

Pseudomalignant osseous tumor of soft tissue

Soft tissue sarcoma such as MFH (before maturation of myositis ossificans)
This 37-year-old woman with diagnosed autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease for 10 years, has progressed to end stage renal disease and required a renal transplant.  While recovering from surgery and on immunosuppression, she sustained a left hip fracture. The fracture was reduced and pinned and a fibular graft was placed. Radiographs after surgery and 3 weeks postoperatively when the patient had complaints of left "hip" swelling and pain, along with mild erythema.
Sixty-75 % of patients with myositis ossificans have a history of trauma or surgery. The sites most commonly involved after trauma are the elbow, thigh and less frequently the shoulder and calf and the more common the the proximal than distal extremities. After prosthetic placement, the soft tissues of the hips and knees are most commonly involved. Participants of high-impact sports (wrestling, football, and rugby) are at the greatest risk for developing myositis ossificans due to blunt trauma sustained during participation.  The initial clinical signs following  trauma are non-specific and may include localized warmth, erythema, tenderness, and occasionally decreased range of motion.  In a period of 1-4 weeks after surgery or trauma, the soft tissue swelling becomes a more discrete mass.     

In the acute stage prior to development of a defined mass,  an inflammatory or infective process such as thrombophlebitis or cellulitis may be considered clinically.      

In 7-10 days after the traumatic episode, periosteal reaction may be seen. Initially a soft tissue mass mass have more flocculent amorphous calcifications and may resemble a soft tissue malignancy. Within 6 to 8 weeks, the mass develops a zonal pattern with mature ossification peripherally characteristic of myositis ossificans.  Radiography and CT show this zonal pattern.  

In the acute stages, treatment includes cold compresses along with rest, elevation, and immobilization followed by graduated range of motion exercises.  If pain and decreased range of motion persist beyond 6 months to a year, patients can be treated surgically.
