MRI:  Bone marrow edema within the lateral cuneiform bone with transverse fracture line.  Thickened plantar fascia with high T2 signal near calcaneal insertion also was seen consistent with plantar fasciitis.
Cuneiform Stress Fracture
-stress fracture
-insufficiency fracture
Foot pain.  History of plantar fasciitis.
This patient had a history of plantar fasciitis, confirmed by MR imaging and likely contributed to altered weight bearing with subsequent stress fracture of the cuneiform bones.
