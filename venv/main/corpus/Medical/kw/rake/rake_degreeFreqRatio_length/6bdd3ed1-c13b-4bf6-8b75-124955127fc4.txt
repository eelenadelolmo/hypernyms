Today we dispensed all the remaining ammonium lactate lotion in stock, half a case of Lubriderm, benzoyl peroxide wash, Hibiclens for cleaning wounds, and bacitracin for applying to wounds after cleansing, Flintstone vitamins, and loratidine 10mg tablets (take 1/2 tab daily), along with a bucket full of candy for all the kids at home. This child has a sibling and a cousin with congenital ichthyosis also. The father who accompanied him today was very pleased with the treatment and very appreciative of the medicines given to him. Our translator passed on some instructions concerning bathing, and using diluted chlorox in the bath once a week. He has been told to avoid overheating, however this is hard in Afghanistan. We don&#39;t have any urea cream, Donovex or retinoids in stock in the pharmacy, which was another treatment course that was discussed in the emails. Thanks to the dermatologists who have contributed to the treatment of this child. I find this case personally rewarding, in that we have made a difference for this child.

This child of approximately 10y/o was first seen on 10APR10, and was seen again today after our initial treatment. He was given multiple bottles of ammonium lactate lotion, antihistamine for itching, and some Eucerin cream moisturizer. A consult was sent through you of which we had two responses from CPT XXX, Chief Dermatologist at  XXX, and LtCol YYY, Chief of Pediatric Dermatology at YYY.
Indeed this patient apparently has a congenital ichthyosis.  Treatment is primarily supportive with copious use of emollients.  Also mild urea cream or ammonium lactate lotion may decrease some of the scale – these topical can sting or burn, especially within fissures.  Topical Dovonex has been shown to have some efficacy, as well as strong topical retinoids.  PO retinoids have often had some impressive results; however, the long-term side-effect profile and the need for lab monitoring in such an environment in Afghanistan makes this impractical. These patients need to be careful of overheating so this should be emphasized to the family. Otherwise, you can emphasize that this patient is not contagious (although he may have some secondary body malodor due to more difficulty with hygiene care).

Dr ZZ is correct.  I have emailed some friends and other peds derms throughout the country at the best centers to see if we could think outside the box on how to help this child with little to no resources.  This child is thicker than most lamellar cases I have seen and that is likely due to the lack of access to care.  Some/most lamellar patients soak hours per day to help exfoliate the skin.  The defect with this condition is the skin continues to adhere to itself rather than exfoliate. Soaking can help many patients.   
Overheating is a big issue with these patients and should be discussed with the parents.  

Secondary bacterial colonization is another issue that can be seen and can get infected once the skin fissures.  I personally like benzoyl peroxide washes once a week or dilute Clorox bathes I will let you know if any ideas come across my desk.  I am out tomorrow, but you can expect emails on Friday our time or today if something comes through.
