2 cm hepatic artery aneurysm with calcifications, proximal to the origin of the right hepatic, left hepatic, and gastroduodenal arteries. Abdominal hernia repair is intact.
Incidental Hepatic Artery Aneurysm
69 y.o. woman with a history of abdominal hernia repair in about 3 years ago. She now complains of a burning sensation in the area of repair, that began about 6 months ago.
Hepatic artery aneurysms account for 20% of splanchnic artery aneurysms with 2:1 male to female ratio. Approximately one third of individuals with hepatic artery aneurysms will also have other splanchnic artery aneurysms. They are also most often discovered in the sixth decade of life. The majority of hepatic artery aneurysms are asymptomatic and found incidentally during imaging for other illnesses, which is the case for this patient. However, if they are symptomatic, patients typically complain of right upper quadrant and epigastric pain, which can be confused with pancreatitis. Furthermore, acute expansion of the aneurysm can cause severe abdominal discomfort and large aneurysms may cause obstructive jaundice.  The most serious complication is rupture and can occur in 20% of patients. Currently, treatment is recommended for aneurysms exceeding 2 cm in diameter or if rapidly expanding. Options for treatment including endovascular or open surgical treatment and percutaneous transcatheter obliteration.
