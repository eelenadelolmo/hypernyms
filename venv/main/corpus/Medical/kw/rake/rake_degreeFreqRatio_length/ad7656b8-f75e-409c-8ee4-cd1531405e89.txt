â€¢ Marked accentuation of gray matter white matter contrast on both ADC MAP and DWI sequences.
â€¢ Hyperintense central gray matter in spinal cord on T2 sequences.
Hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy, drowning, brain death
â€¢ Hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy
â€¢ Brain Death
â€¢ Fresh water drowning

Freshwater drowning - with pulmonary aspiration of water filling alveoli - may present with hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy.
