PHYSICAL EXAM:	Multiple scattered and isolated erythematous papules, papulovesicles, necrotic papules and crusted plaques. These numbered between 12-15 lesions and were distributed on the arms, thighs, calves, and feet. 
LABORATORY:	WBC = 8.4; ESR = lmm; RPR = NR; chest X-ray = Normal 
HISTOPATHOLOGY: Band-like dermal infiltrate invading the epidermis with epidermal necrosis and vacuolopathy. The lymphocytes are atypical with pleomorphism and several with
hyperchromatic cerebriform nuclei.
No response to eight weeks of tetracycline and topical
clobetasol. Intralesional triamcinolone does seem to
halt progression to necrosis and scarring. To date no
adenopathy has developed and the patient has a normal chest X-ray.
LYMPHOMATOID PAPULOSIS (1997 Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, Case#18B) submitted by: LCDR Bradley S. Graham, MC, USNR
presented with a 2 week history of crops of papules, blisters, and ulcers. Starting first on the right arm, the lesions subsequently spread to involve his abdomen and lower legs. Other than pain with ulceration, the lesions were asymptomatic. No history of weight loss, fatigue or fever.
