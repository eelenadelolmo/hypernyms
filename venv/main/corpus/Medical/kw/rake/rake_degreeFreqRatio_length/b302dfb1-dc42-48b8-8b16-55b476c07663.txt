Head circumference greater than 95%.
Supportive
• Low T1 Signal involving the periventricular white matter and high T1 signal involving the periventricular rim.
• Increased T2 signal int the involved white matter and the basal ganglia
• On post-contrast imaging there is intense enhancement of the basal ganglia
Alexander  Disease, Rosenthal Fiber Encephalopathy
• Canavan disease:  Diffuse involvement of the brain, with the subcortical U fibers involved early
• Megaloencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts:  Diffuse white matter involvment (including subcortical U fibers), but spares the basal ganglia
• Mucopolysaccharidoses: Prominent Virchow Robin spaces, and patchy, periventricular white matter signal abnormality
• Alexander's Disease
Six month old baby boy with intermittent vomiting for 7 weeks Now listless.  Parents say his head is too big.
