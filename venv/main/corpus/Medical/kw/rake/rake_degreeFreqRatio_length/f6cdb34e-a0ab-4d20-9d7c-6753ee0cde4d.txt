Patient was admitted to the hospital for nutritional support.  He later developed a complete stricture and surgery plans for operative treatment.
Small bowel follow through with serial radiographs demonstrate kinking of small bowel in the left lower quadrant, an extrinsic band in the lower abdomen and a transition point in the right lower quadrant.  During spot compression views the defects in the left lower quadrant and the lower abdomen were fixed in position.  6 hours post oral contrast administration patient was evaluated with real time fluoroscopy which demonstrated a narrow stricture at the site of anastomosis in the right lower quadrant.
Intraperitoneal Adhesions with Anastomotic Stricture and Partial Small Bowel Obstruction
Intraperitoneal adhesions
Stricture
Mesenteric ischemia
55 year old white male 4 weeks post-op from distal ileal resection and reanastomosis from superior mesenteric artery thrombosis.  Patient presents with 3 week history of decreased appetite, bloating, and watery stools.  Evaluation for small bowel through was ordered for evaluation of ischemic bowel.
Real time fluoroscopiic evaluation gives the advantage of visualizing bowel morphology, peristalsis and mobility of bowel loops.  This exam is more sensitive for the evaluation of adhesions secondary to direct visualization.
