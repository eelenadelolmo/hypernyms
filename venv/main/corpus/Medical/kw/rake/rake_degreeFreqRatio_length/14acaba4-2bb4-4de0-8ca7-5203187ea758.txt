On examination pain, swelling, tenderness and redness of the right scrotum was seen.
Consevatively managed
Ultrasound of scrotum  revealed  intra testicular hematoma/contusion with fracture lines,seen as hypoechoic lines which were seen crossing the tunica albuginea.
Mild asymmetry was also seen in the testicular contour which suggested rupture of the testis.
Colour Doppler did not show any testicular flow which suggested vascular injury.

Moderate amount of haematocoele was also seen.
The patient was observed conservatively ,since considerable time had elapsed  and vascularity could not be restored.
TESTICULAR FRACTURE

The trauma  ocurred when the bullock got a bit out of control and injury was suffered to the scrotal region due to the kick from the hind foot of the bull.
