Generally germinal matrix hemorrhage is managed conservatively.  If there is hydrocephalus, treatments can include diuretics, lumbar puncture or VP shunt.
Hyperechoic foci within the brain parynchema adjacent to the right caudo-thalamic groove, without right ventricular dilation.
Germinal Matrix Hemorrhage
Germinal Matrix Hemorrhage
Patient is a 5 day old premature infant born at an estimated gestational age of 25 weeks having seizures.
Grade 3 and 4 hemorrhage is often associated with long term complications, with greater risk of morbitiy or mortality with younger gestational age.  At approximatley 24 weeks 40% of infants will survive, and 40% of survivors will have no handicap.  At 29 weeks, 90% survive and 90% will have no handicap.
