N/A
Undergoing evaluation by orthopedics.
Axial and sagittal STIR sequences demonstrate bone marrow edema in the medial patellar facet and lateral femoral condyle compatible with prior transient lateral patellar dislocation.  The cartilage of the medial patellar facet is denuded.  An effusion is present and an associated tear of the medial retinalum is demonstrated.
Traumatic Transient Lateral Patellar Dislocation.
None
17 year old with history of knee trauma.
The bone contusion pattern for transient lateral patellar dislocation is pathognomonic.  In some cases MR findings are the only suggestion for the mechanism of injury.
