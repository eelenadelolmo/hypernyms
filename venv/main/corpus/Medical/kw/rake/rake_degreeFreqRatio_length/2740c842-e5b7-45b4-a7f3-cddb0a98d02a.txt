While this child underwent surgery, prospective genetic counselling for the parents is of paramount importance.  Genetic testing and radiographic screening of the child's siblings should be performed.  A long term individualized service plan to insure the child receives appropriate physical and occupational therapy is also important.  The parents should be made aware of their child's rights under the American's with Disabilities Act as it applies to her future education and pre-education before the age of five.
