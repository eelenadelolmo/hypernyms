PE was non-contributory.
CT:   Single transverse section through the liver with IV contrast.  Multiple smooth-contoured hepatic lesions of higher attenuation than the surrounding hepatic parenchyma are noted in the left lobe.  One extremely large lesion, which abuts the hepatic capsule, is of particular note because of its size.  There is no evidence of intra-lesion scarring or calcification noted.

US:  Single longitudinal image of liver showing hypoechoic regions with smooth margins consistent with findings on CT.  Single Doppler enhanced transverse image of same hepatic region showing blood flow to the largest hypoechoic region of liver.  These findings suggests vascularization of a large hepatic mass with multiple non-vascularized smaller satellite masses.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma confirmed on US-guided needle biopsy.

When a mass-like lesion in the liver is observed on imaging, the next step is to attempt determining which diagnosis best fits the given radiologic findings. Given the findings noted above, focal confluent fibrosis (FCF), focal fat, and hemangioma can be removed from the differential.  FCF tends to be of equal or slightly lower attenuation as surrounding normal parenchyma on IV contrast-enhanced CT.  Focal fat will be of low attenuation similar to subcutaneous fat on CT.  The benign lesion, hemangioma, will attenuate similar to blood and will display increased attentuation on enhancement.  However, when contrast is added to enhance, the hemangioma will exhibit delayed enhancement in a centripetal pattern, unlike the “instant” and complete enhancement of the lesions shown above.  Enhancement is delayed secondary to the relatively low flow state within the lesion.  Primary hepatic lymphoma usually appears multilobulated and poorly enhancing on CT.  Fibrolamellar carcinomas are hyperechoic lesions on US and often display punctate calcifications and low attenuation on enhanced CT.  Metastases will most commonly show scattered small lesions throughout the hepatic parenchyma rather than the large lesion depicted in the attached CT and US.
