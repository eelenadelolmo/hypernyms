On examination: A bony hard swelling was present over the left maxillary area.  Left infra orbital rim was also involved.  Proptosis of left eye ball was present.  Ocular movements was full and vision was normal.  Supra alveolar margin was enlarged on the left side.  There was loosening of canine teeth and 2nd premolar teeth on the left side.
Since the swelling was cosmetically not acceptable to the patient maxilla on the left side was parred using diamond burr bits and motor.
CT scan plain axial of para nasal sinuses showed complete opacification of the left maxillary sinus.  The opacification had obliterated the whole of left maxillary sinus.  Posteriorly  opacification extended up to the left pterygoid process.
Fibrous dysplasia of Maxilla
1. Fungal granuloma
2. Malignancy of maxilla
3. Fibrous dysplasia of maxilla
Swelling over left side of cheek with protrusion of left eye ball - 10 years.
No h/o symptoms pertaining to nose.
No h/o symptoms pertaining to left eye.
Attained puberty at the age of 15.
Menstrual history : normal regular 28 days cycle.
Marital status: Unmarried
Fibrous dysplasia of the facial skeleton commonly involves the maxilla.  It commonly involves one maxilla.  The patient manifests with unilateral swelling of cheek (firm in consistency).  Patient may have unilateral proptosis because dysplasia involves the boundaries of the orbit reducing the space available for the orbital contents.  Some of these patients may suffer loss of vision due to entrapment of optic nerve in the dysplastic process.
