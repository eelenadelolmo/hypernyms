Neck: Normal range of motion
Cardio:  2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal edge
Abdomen: No hepatosplenomegaly

Current recommendations state that antiviral treatment with ganciclovir and valganciclovir should be initiated within the first 30 days of life only in newborns with severe focal organ disease or CNS disease. Treatment typically lasts for 6 weeks.  In addition, follow-up audiological and ophthalmic assessments need to be performed on all newborns with confirmed congenital CMV to monitor for potential neurological sequelae.
