No neurologic or radicular symptoms.
No treatment or follow up needed.
T1 and T2 weighted sagittal images of the lumbar spine demonstrate no significant degenerative changes or further evidence for disk pathology. (The axial images through the disc spaces confirm this, although not shown.)  The marrow signal of the vertebral bodies is essentially normal and the visualized posterior soft tissues appear unremarkable.  There is no MR abnormality to explain the patient’s symptoms.
            Incidentally found is a reniform shaped structure anterior to the L5 vertebral body.  This is confirmed on the other image sequences to be a kidney ectopically located.  Review of the axial T2 sequences, demonstrate the ectopic kidney to be in the right pelvis, anterior to the lumbo-sacral junction, and anteromedial to the right iliac vessels and the right iliopsoas muscle.  Review of the T2 axial images more cranially, demonstrate the left kidney is located normally within the renal fossa.  On the right, only the right lobe of the liver is identified in this location.
