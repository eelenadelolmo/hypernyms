The treatment for this patient could involve limited weight bearing on the affected ankle with possible casting.  Surgical procedures are considered when the bone fragment is detached from the underlying bone or demonstrates signs of instability. The bone fragment can be surgically removed or reattached to the underlying bone.  Attempts to increase blood flow to the affected area can be accomplished by drilling into the bone during surgery as well.
On plain radiographs, a relative lucency projects over the medial dome of the talus.  No acute fracture line or joint effusion is appreciated.  The joint space is well maintained.
On MRI T1 Sagittal images, a 1.3 cm x 1.5 cm area of low signal intensity is seen along the posterior talar dome.  T2 weighted axial images demonstrate increased signal intensity which completely surrounds an area of low signal intensity in an arc like fashion over the medial posterior talar dome.  Additionally, a small amount of increased T2 signal intensity is seen within the joint space consistent with a small effusion.
Osteochondritis Dissecans, juvenile-type
Osteomyelitis (usually has associated bone marrow edema and cortical bone destruction)
Osteonecrosis  (associated subchondral bone sclerosis and infarct morphology on MRI)
Fracture 
Bone erosion from an inflammatory arthritis such as Rheumatoid Arthritis
Osteoarthritis
Eosinophilic Granuloma or other primary bone tumor
Metastatic Lesion
Transient Osteoporosis
History of several ankle sprains with chronic left ankle pain since age 15.
This patient demonstrates separation of a portion of subchondral bone along the posterior medial articular surface of her talus.  This is a classic location for osteochondritis dissecans in the ankle.  Other common locations for these lesions occur in the anterolateral ankle, medial femoral condyle, and capitellum.  These lesions are thought to be the result of prior trauma involving shearing and impaction forces.

There are juvenile and adult forms of Osteochondritis Dissecans .  The juvenile form is represented by this case and occurs before physeal closure.  The juvenile form usually heals with conservative treatment while the adult form of osteochondral defects has a poorer prognosis.  This patient presented in her second decade of life.  Patients typically present in their second through fourth decades of life.  

The affected bone fragment in this case demonstrates MRI characteristics suggesting that it is unstable and possibly loose.  The fragment is still attached to the host bone; however, it has linear high signal intensity surrounding it on the T2 weighted axial images.  Surgery is indicated if the fragment is displaced or shows signs of being unstable.  Other signs of an unstable fragment include seeing a 5 mm or larger cystic focus between the fragment and host bone, a focus of T2 high linear signal overlying the affected bone cartilage, or a 5 mm or larger defect in overlying cartilage .  Unstable fragments are defined as demonstrating one or more of these characteristics.
