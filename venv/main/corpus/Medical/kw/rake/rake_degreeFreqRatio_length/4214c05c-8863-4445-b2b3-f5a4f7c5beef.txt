Temporary placement of nephrostomy tube in right kidney followed by hysterectomy.
- Abdominal radiograph demonstrates a soft tissue density over the pelvis. 
- A post void image of an intravenous urogram study demonstrates hydronephrosis of the right collecting system with normal, symmetric kidney sizes. There is delayed opacification of right collecting system. Delayed images demonstrate ureteral narrowing at a level above UVJ at  the level of the mid right ureter.
Hydronephrosis of the right ureter secondary to extrinsic mass compression from a leiomyoma of the uterus (demonstrated by CT).
A 32 year old female with several month history of abdominal pain.
