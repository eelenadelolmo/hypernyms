Physical exam unremarkable. Thyroid normal. Lungs clear. Cardiac exam WNL. No abdominal masses.  Lan: 24 hr VMA 107.6 (0-10.0), epinephrine 170 (. 5-20), norepinephrine 460 (15-18)  total catecholamines 3196 (123-671 supine)
prazosin 1mg po BID prior to surgery followed by surgical excision.  Follow up with repeat VMA and metanephrines and imaging studies.  If the pheochromocytoma is malignant, as evidenced by invasion and metastasis then treatment is primarily surgical with chemotherapy playing only a palliative role.
