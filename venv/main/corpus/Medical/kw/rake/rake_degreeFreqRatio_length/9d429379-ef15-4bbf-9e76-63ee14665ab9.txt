Left neck dissection for debulking of mass.  PO steroids for respiratory symptoms.
Significant bilateral neck adenopathy. Confluent left parotid and periparotid nodal mass with largest single node measuring 2.7cm x 1.9cm.  Numerous other left level II and III nodes with largest measuring 3.6cm x 2.1cm.  Mediastinal and bihilar adenopathy.
Sarcoidosis
• Sarcoidosis
• Lymphoma
• Reactive lymphadenopathy (fungal, etc.)
• Catscratch disease
• Metastatic carcinoma
32 year old woman with a 2 year history of slowly growing lump on neck along and progressive shortness of breath.  No history of fevers, weight loss or recent illness.  Patient had recently undergone dental procedure around time the lump was first noted.
Sarciodosis is a systemic multisystem granulomatous disease characterized by a variable clinical presentation and course.  Cutaneous lesions are present in about one fourth of patients. Although any organ can be affected, 90% of patients demonstrate thoracic involvement with decreased diffusion capacity being the most common abnormality found on pulmonary function testing.  There is a strong association between subcutaneous sarciodosis and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (72.7%). Sarciodosis is a diagnosis of exclusion supported by three elements: 1. Compatible clinical and radiologic findings, 2. Tissue biopsy specimen that reveals noncaseating epithelioid granulomas, and 3. Absence of known granulomagenic agents. 

Etiology
A large multi centered study called A Case Control Etiologic Study of Sarciodosis (ACCESS) showed that environmental factors such as mold, mildew, must odors and pesticides were associated with a modestly increased risk (OR~1.5) of developing sarciodosis. Genetics and host factors also are involved in the pathogenesis of sarciodosis.  In the US, blacks are more frequently affected and the ACCESS trial showed that affected patients were five times more likely than controls to report a sibling with the disease.  Further, recent studies have identified specific genes associated with sarciodosis.  A single-nucleotide polymorphism on the BTNL2 gene may influence T-lymphocyte activation and regulation and make people carrying this polymorphism more susceptible to sarciodosis.  A second gene associated with sarciodosis is Annexin A11 on chromosome 10q22.3 responsible for calcium signaling, cell division and apoptosis.  



Deficits of this gene have been associated with sarciodosis.  Further, HLA haplotypes and T-cell receptor expression play an intricate role in the development of the disease.

Biomarker screening
In an attempt to aid in diagnosis of sarciodosis, investigators continue to search for potential biomarkers in disease activity. Chitotriosidase is an enzyme expressed by activated macrophages and Bargagli et al. found elevated levels of this enzyme in patients with sarciodosis, with >90% exhibiting elevated levels of the marker.  A second marker IL-2, a cytokine that induces T-cell proliferation and activation is elevated in serum of patients with sarciodosis and may have prognostic value.  

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of sarciodosis is best supported by a combination of radiographic evidence of lymphadenopathy and tissue specimens that show noncaseating granulomas.  Endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspiration when compared to non-guided transbronchial needle aspiration had a diagnosis yield of 83.3% compared to 53.8%.  

Treatment
Therapy for patients with chronic sarciodosis requires prolonged treatment often with steroids which cause systemic side effects.  TNF inhibitors have been investigated for the treatment, but a study by Utz et al, found treatment failure in nearly 65% of participants.  A new TNF-alpha antagonist Ustekinumab, approved for dosing in patients with RA, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis; is currently being tested for its efficacy in treatment of sarciodosis with completion of the study anticipated in July 2011.  Surgical indication for patients with sarciodosis remains controversial.  Surgery has potential to reduce symptoms and decrease need for oral steroids, but does not eradicate or prevent recurrence of disease.  Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone for treatment, but care must be taken to assess for potential adverse effects.
