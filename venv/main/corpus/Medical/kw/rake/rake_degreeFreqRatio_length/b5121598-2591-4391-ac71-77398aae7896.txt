N/A
The patient had immediate sigmoidoscopy in the ICU after return from radiology; GI bleed was confirmed from angiodysplasia and was it was treated.
Enhanced CT images with oral and IV contrast (note that oral contast had not yet progressed to the level of the left colon or rectum) demonstrate linear hyperattenuating material within the sigmoid colon and rectum.  The rectum is dilated and appears to contain hyperdense material with a fluid-fluid level (hematocrit effect).
Angiodysplasia, Lower Gastrointestinal Bleed
• Acute GI bleed (on CT)
• Oral contrast in lower GI tract from fistula
• Vascular malformation of the colon
• Parasitic disease
65 y.o. man with multiple medical problems from the ICU -  now with lower abdominal pain.  Immediately after a screening CT study was performed, he experienced an episode of acute GI bleed (passed a large amount of fresh blood per rectum).
This is a case of active GI bleed demonstrated on CT imaging.
