Treatment of SCFE includes limitation of activity and prophylactic pinning to prevent further slippage.  It is important to note that attempted non-operative reductions increase the risk of avascular necrosis.
AP pelvis and frog-leg lateral radiographs of the right hip demonstrate widening of the proximal femoral epiphyseal growth plate with apparent foreshortening of the right femoral neck.
