Sensorineural hearing loss
The type of treatment that will be offered to the patient will depend on the extent of involvement of the mass and the amount of SNHL present.
Translabyrinthine resection will be done if no hearing preservation is possible.

Middle cranial fossa approach for intracanalicular VS, especially if the mass is laterally located in the IAC, is used. 

Radiation therapy may be offered when medical contraindications to surgery are present or residual post-operative VS remains. It is given to patients in the following manner: Gamma knife, implying low dose, sharply collimated, focused cobalt-60.
An avidly enhancing cylindrical or ice cream on cone CPA-IAC mass is seen. The mass looks ovoid to cylindrical.

The lesion is small (2-10mm) lies within the internal auditory canal, looking like an ovoid to cylindrical mass. 

On T1 weighted imaging plus contrast, there is a focal enhancing mass of CPA-IAC cistern centered on the porus acousticus.
Vestibular Schwannoma
• Vestibular Schwannoma
• Facial nerve Schwannoma
• Meningioma
• Epidermoid cyst
• Arachnoid cyst
• Metastasis and lymphoma
• Aneurysm.
64 year old woman presents with a right sided tinnitus and hearing loss that was slowly progressive in nature.
