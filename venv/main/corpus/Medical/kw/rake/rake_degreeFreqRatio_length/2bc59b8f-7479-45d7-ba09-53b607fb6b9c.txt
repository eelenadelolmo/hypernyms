Patient has C-section planned. A total hysterectomy will most likely follow delivery.
Coronal imaging through the patient demonstrates a live third trimester fetus. The placenta can be seen to be overlying the expected location of the cervical os and this is compatible with a complete placenta previa. 

Sagital imaging through the pelvis demonstrates complete replacement of the cervix by invading chorionic villi and confirms a diagnosis of complete placenta previa. Also note the anterior attachement of the placenta to the uterine wall which is pertinent for C-section planning
Placenta Percreta
Planceta Previa with placenta percreta. Lesser forms of placental invasion are excluded by imaging.
Patient was referred for fetal MRI to better define abnormal ultrasound exam findings from an outside institution.
Placenta percreta is the most severe form of invasive placentation. This case is somewhat unique in its complete involvement of the cervix. As can be seen from this case fetal MRI can provide exquisite detail for operative planning and patient management.
