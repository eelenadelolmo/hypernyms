Examination revealed a chronically ill appearing elderly male. Abdominal exam was negative save evidence of prior surgery to include a ileal conduit stoma in the right lower quadrant. Laboratory evaluation revealed mild leukocytosis. Urine culture revealed Klebsiella pneumoniae.
CT scan (without contrast due to renal insufficiency) revealed no evidence of intra-abdominal abscess, however the liver was found to harbor multiple lesions, biopsy of which revealed metastatic transitional cell carcinoma (figure 1). Additonally, a lytic lesion was found of the L2 vertebral body (figure 2). Because of the recurring fevers an Indium-111 tagged WBC study was requested (figures 3 and 4). After reviewing the indium scan results, the primary service relayed that the patient was also complaining of back pain. The differential diagnosis of the findings from the CT and Indium scan included possible discitis/vertebral osteomyelitis, and metastatic disease. 

Subsequent MR (figure 5) of the lumbar spine demonstrates collapse of the L2 vertebral body, as well as heterogeneous marrow replacement. There was no surrounding fluid component. The discs did not demonstrate involvement with the process. There was marked gadolinium enhancement of the lesions within the vertebral body.
