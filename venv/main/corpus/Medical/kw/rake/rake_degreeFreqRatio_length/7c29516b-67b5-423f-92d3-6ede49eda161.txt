Vitals:  Temp 37.0, HR 120
On exam the patient was alert and playful.  Her pupils were equal and reactive and she tracked objects well in all directions.  Her face was symmetric and her tongue was midline.  She had a small raised reddened area at the tip of her nose which extended upward approximately 1 cm; no pit was visualized and it was without discharge.  She was able to move all extremities equally with good tone, and ambulated independently with a steady gait.
The patient had the nasal dermoid surgically removed without complication. Follow up imaging studies several years later demonstrated no signs of recurrence.
MR: There is an inhomogeneous, fat-containing mass in the anterior cranial fossa extending anteriorly and bridging between both cerebral hemispheres.  The mass is extra-axial and does not enhance.  A sinus tract can be seen within the subcutaneous tissues tracking to the midline of the nose.

A 20 month-old female presented with a red, ‚Äúpimple-like‚Äù lesion on the tip of her nose.  The lesion first appeared a year prior to her presentation, and had increased in size and changed color over that time.  Her past medical history is significant for premature birth at 27 weeks gestation, developmental delay, and viral meningitis at 10 months of age.
