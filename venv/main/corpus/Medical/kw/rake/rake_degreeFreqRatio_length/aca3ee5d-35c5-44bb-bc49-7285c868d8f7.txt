Texto: 
FT4: 2.10  (0.71-1.85 ng/dL)
TSH: <0.08 (0.49-4.67 MCIU/ml)
Thyroid Stimulating Antibody:  226  (0-129% baseline)

I131 uptake:  4 hours  23% (2-12%),and 24 hours 59% (12-30%)
15 mCi of I131 was orally administered for Graves' Disease therapy.
Tc 99m pertechnetate scan demonstrates an increase in overall radiotracer accumulation compared to background. A pyramidal lobe is clearly evident. A slight nodular appearance is visualized, but no heterogeneity or photopenic-appearing nodules are seen to suggest a toxic multi-nodular goiter. However, ideally, imaging with radioactive iodine should be performed to exclude the possibility of "discordant nodule(s)"
Graves' Disease with an underlying multinodular goiter is most likely
