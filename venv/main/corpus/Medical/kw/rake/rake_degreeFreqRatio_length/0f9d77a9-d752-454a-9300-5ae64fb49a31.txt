Management of the renal disease is difficult.  If these patients do not die from associated pulmonary insufficiency, some may be treated with dialysis.  Renal transplantation may be possible after the first year of life.
Ultrasound: Increased echogenicity throughout the renal parenchyma of both kidneys with loss of normal corticomedullary differentiation.  The renal parenchyma of both kidneys has multiple non-communicating cysts.  There are bilateral hydroureters and moderate to severe bilateral hydronephrosis.

4 day old infant with a history of pyelectasis on obstetric sonogram.
As a result of posterior urethral valves and reflux, this patient has developed obstructive cystic renal dysplasia.  This patient has sonographically visible cysts and increased cortical echogenicity within the kidneys.  One must remember that not all dysplastic kidneys have these findings.  The absence of these findings does not necessarily predict the absence of renal dysplasia.  In cystic renal dysplasia, recognizable parenchyma surrounds the cysts while in a multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) no normal renal parenchyma can be identified between the cysts.  As in this case, cystic renal dysplasia most commonly occurs as a result of urethral obstruction and frequently involves both kidneys.  This is in contrast to MCDK which occurs bilaterally in only 20% of cases.
