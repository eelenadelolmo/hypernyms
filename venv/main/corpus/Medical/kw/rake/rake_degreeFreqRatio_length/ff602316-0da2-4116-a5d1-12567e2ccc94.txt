Translabyrinthine resection can be performed if there is no possibility for hearing preservation.  Patient is pending ENT evaluation.
Contrast enhanced T1WI demonstrate a well circumscribed round 1.9 mm lesion inside the left internal auditory canal.  No other lesions or parenchymal/leptomeningeal enhancement is present.

38 year old white woman with asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss.
The vestibular ("acoustic") schwannoma (also known as the "acoustic neuroma") is a benign tumor that arises from Schwann cells that make myelin for cranial nerve VIII.  Patients may present with tinnitus with small masses and trigeminal or facial neuropathy with large masses. Approximately 75% grow at a gradual pace, 10% grow rapidly and 15% grow very slowly.
Imaging findings include an ovoid mass in the cerebellar pontine angle cistern/internal auditory canal.  T1WI demonstrates strong enhancement with 15% presenting with some cystic change.  0.5% are associated with an arachnoid
cyst and 0.5% have a hemorrhagic focus.
