Gravid patient with tenderness and swelling of her left lower extremity.
Lovenox (Low molecular weight heparin)
(Coumadin is a class C drug and is contraindicated in pregnancy.)
The transverse sonographic image demonstrates noncompressibility of the popliteal vein due to occusive thrombus.  The longitudinal sonographic images demonstrate a hyperechoic thrombus within the lumen of the vessel.
Deep venous thrombosis
DDX of physical findings:
•Deep venous thrombosis
•Ruptured Baker's cyst
•Cellulitis 
•Chronic venous insufficiency 
•Extrinsic venous compression 
•Superficial thrombophlebitis 
•Hematoma
