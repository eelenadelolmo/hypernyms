Pain with palpation over the anterior aspect of the left ankle. No anterior drawer sign.
Multiple radiographs of the left ankle demonstrate a well ciricumscribed oval fragment of the medial talar dome. MRI images of the left ankle also demonstrate osseous edema within the same region with a small oval fragment of the medial talar dome.

20 year old male soldier reports hitory of multiple inversion and eversion injuries of the left ankle with persistent ankle pain that is exacerbated with running.
In the ankle joint, OCD occurs more frequently in the talus than in the tibial plafond.  Disparity in frequency results because tibial cartilage is stiffer than talar cartilage. The usual sites of OCD of the talar dome are the posteromedial aspect (56%) and the anterolateral aspect (44%) of the talus. Occasionally, mirror-image osteochondral defects of the talus and distal tibia occur, suggesting trauma as a potential cause of both lesions
