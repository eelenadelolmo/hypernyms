A focal hypodense lesion is seen at the peripheral aspect of the right lobe of the liver within an area of focal fatty sparring.  During the arterial phase, the lesion shows rapid peripheral nodular enhancement with a stable hypodense center.  On delayed phases, the lesion fills in with contrast and becomes homogeneously bright.
Cavernous hemangioma
Numerous focal liver lesion exist, but given the imaging pattern of enhancement in this case, there is only one possibility of a cavernous hemangioma.

This is not likely to be focal nodular hyperplasia because that entity typically is isodense at baseline, rapidly enhances and rapidly washes out.  15-33% of the time a central scar is present that has delayed enhancement and delayed washout compared with the rest of the lesion.

This is not likely to be an adenoma because although an adenoma can have many appearances on CT, they typically do not demonstrate a early peripheral nodular enhancement with a delayed uniform enhancement pattern.

This is not likely to be a metastatic lesion either because these lesions usually show rim enhancement with rapid contrast washout not the peripheral nodular enhancement seen in this case.

Finally, this is not likely to be a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) because classically they demonstrate rapid washout and return to baseline density after contrast administration unlike this hemangioma which has delayed contrast within the lesion long after the venous phase.  Also, a peripheral nodular enhancement pattern is not calssic for an HCC.
Liver lesion noted on RUQ US performed for other reasons.
Also note the phases of enhancement in the left kidney - first the cortex enhances, then the medulla.
