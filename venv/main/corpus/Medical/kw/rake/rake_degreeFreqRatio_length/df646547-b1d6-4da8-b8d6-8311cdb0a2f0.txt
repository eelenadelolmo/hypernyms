Usually when symptomatic, biopsy and curettage are the main treatment options. The patient had a curettage of the cuboid with placement of bone graft material to help structurally support her foot. 

Follow-up included additional imaging to ensure proper healing as well as evaluating for recurrence of the aneurysmal bone cyst. Radiographs showed the cement in the region of the curettage and no recurrence of lucency.
AP, lateral and oblique radiographic views of the right foot show a well-defined radiolucent medullary mass of the cuboid bone that expands the cortex but does not cause cortical disruption. There is a narrow zone of transition. Follow-up radiographs after curettage show the cement placement in the region of curettage without recurrence of the aneurysmal bone cyst.

Axial CT of the right foot with bone windows show a lytic mass expanding the cuboid bone  and measuring 3 cm x 2.6 cm in greatest dimension with multiple fluid-fluid levels. The cortex is thinned. Soft tissue windows suggest fluid-fluid levels. No matrix calcifications are seen. These findings are consistent with an aneurysmal bone  cyst.

Aneurysmal bone cysts (ABC) are described as a benign “vascular reactive lesion.” They usually present as lytic expansile masses found most commonly in the metaphysis of the tibia and femur and posterior portions of the vertebrae. They usually are non-aggressive in appearance and do not disrupt the cortex. The mass may have a thin rim of cortex remaining giving it an “egg-shell” appearance. The lytic portion of the mass has also been described as having a “soap-bubble” appearance.  
	CT is also helpful in the evaluation of this lesion since it may show more clearly that the matrix has no calcifications and show preservation of the cortex. CT can sometimes show the fluid-fluid levels which represent blood products in heterogeneous stages of breakdown on histological examination.
	MRI confirms the contours and shows the fluid-fluid levels, while also demonstrating the surrounding soft tissues more clearly than CT. This is because of the improved contrast seen on the MR images. It is also the modality of choice for identifying nodularity within the wall of the cyst, which may direct future biopsy.
	Aneurysmal bone cysts are accompanied by associated tumor approximately 20-30% of the time. These associated tumors include, most commonly giant cell tumors, but may also include fibrous dysplasia, chondroblastoma, osteoblastoma, osteosarcma, and chondrosarcoma. 
	Treatment of ABC’s generally treated surgically, although they may also be observed for growth rate and further involvement. If there are questions regarding the exact diagnosis and there appears to be an associated lesion, then biopsy should be performed. If a malignancy is found, the patient has a wide resection of the tumor. If the ABC is symptomatic and no malignancy is seen, curettage is the treatment of choice.  Selective embolization, intralesional injection, irradiation, and en bloc resection have also been described. Recurrence rates are not uncommon with these bone cysts, occurring approximately 0-30%.
