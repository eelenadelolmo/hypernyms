Axial CT images through the lower thorax and upper abdomen following the administration of oral and IV contrast material demonstrate a segment of significant circumferential wall thickening and lumenal narrowing involving the distal third of the esophagus and the proximal aspect of the stomach. There is associated lymphadenopathy.

PET/CT fusion images in axial, sagital and coronal planes deomstrate focal increased FDG-18 metabolism in the region of wall thickening identified on the CT scan with a maximum SUV of 11.6.
