Complains of "double vision" (diplopia) and pain on upward gaze.
• Fractures through both the medial orbital wall and medial orbital floor
• Entrapment of interior rectus/oblique muscles
• Herniation of orbital fat into left maxillary antrum
Blowout fracture of orbit (orbital floor fracture) with associated medial orbital wall fracture
• Medial orbital wall fracture
• Congenital dehiscence of the lamina papyracea (hypoplasia of the ethmoid complex)
26 y/o man with blunt trauma to the left eye.
Greater than 50% of orbital floor fractures are associated with fracture of the medial orbital wall.  The presence of orbital emphysema can help identify medial wall fractures, as orbital air usually arises from an ethmoid sinus fracture and rarely from an isolated maxillary fracture.

The orbital fat that herniates through the orbital floor defect may have higher attenuation than expected because of hemorrhage.

The two clinical indications for immediate surgery of an orbital blow-out fracture include definite muscle entrapment and acute enophthalmos.  The degree of enophthalmos may take several days to develop clinically, because of the presence of periorbital edema and hemorrhage.
