Texto: 
Gen - well-appearing elderly gentleman in no acute distress.
HEENT - normocephalic, atraumatic, PERRLA, EOMI, OP clear
Neck - supple, nontender, no lymphadenopathy
Chest - clear to auscultation bilaterally
CV - regular rate and rhythm, no rubs or murmurs
Abd - bowel sounds present, palpable pulsatile abdominal mass, no organomegally
Blood pressure control and stent-graft repair.
Contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen. A moderate degree of atherosclerotic calcifications are noted involving the aorta. In addition, there is a large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 6 cm in widest diameter, with peripheral atherosclerotic calcification and wall thickening. There is no plaque alteration identified and there is no abdominal hemorrhage noted. Bilateral renal cysts are noted. There is no stone or solid mass identified in either kidney. The adrenal glands, pancreas, spleen and small bowel loops are within normal limits. Numerous small cystic structures are noted in the right and left lobes of the liver. There is diffuse osteopenia without evidence of focal bony lesion.

AAA Etiologies:
<li>Atherosclerosis
