1.  The CT findings are consistent with chronic pancreatitis with acute exacerbation and presence of multiple pseudocysts.  Thrombosis of the splenic vein with collateral circulations.

2.  Moderate distinction of the intrahepatic biliary duct and marked dilatation of the extrahepatic biliary ductal system the gallbladder.  The obstruction is mostly at the level of the distal common bile duct.  This is either caused by the stenosis of the distal segment of the common bile duct at the level of the pancreatic head secondary due to chronic pancreatitis and/or lesions at the ampulla causing obstruction.
