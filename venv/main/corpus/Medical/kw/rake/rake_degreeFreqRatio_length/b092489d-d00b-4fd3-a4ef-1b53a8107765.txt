1.  The CT findings are consistent with chronic pancreatitis with acute exacerbation and presence of multiple pseudocysts.  Thrombosis of the splenic vein with collateral circulations.

2.  Moderate distinction of the intrahepatic biliary duct and marked dilatation of the extrahepatic biliary ductal system the gallbladder.  The obstruction is mostly at the level of the distal common bile duct.  This is either caused by the stenosis of the distal segment of the common bile duct at the level of the pancreatic head secondary due to chronic pancreatitis and/or lesions at the ampulla causing obstruction.
Chronic pancreatitis
acute exacerbation of chronic pancreatits
penetrating peptic ulcer

60 year old white male presents with abdominal pain and jaundice.  Pain is described as "deep pain in my stomach and my back."  Upon further questioning, pt reveals that the pain often occurs at night, and is often worse with eating.  The pt admits that he has been experiencing this pain for about 2 months, but decided to see a doctor due to a recent increase in pain.
Pt admits to excessive alcohol use for several years.
important to distinguish "big duct" chronic pancreatitis.  this will effect pt treatment.
