Texto: 
Neurological exam was significant for a right sided central facial weakness and mild right sided weakness with a 4-5 beat clonus. Some difficulty with tandem gait and decrease in right arm swing was observed on natural gait.
The patient was treated initially with solumedrol, and then switched to prednisone, and then to a lower dose prednisone and Imuran. The patient's disease showed good response to the steroids and immunosuppression.

Serial MRI was done to follow the lesions, which also showed good response to steroids.
MRI evaluation was significant for:
• lesion in the left midbrain with T1 and T2 signal hyperintensity that enhances with contrast, with a surrounding area of T2 hyperintensity. 
• multiple lesions in the pons, thalamus, and medulla found in the white matter - with no significant mass effect.
Behcet Disease/syndrome
• ADEM
• inflammatory disorders including Behcet's
• cerebritis
• rhombencephalitis
• cerebral infarcts
A 24 yo right-hand dominant man presented with a 4 wk course of insidious onset right sided weakness including facial weakness and mild dysarthria.
The patient's initial presentation of right sided weakness can be explained by the lesions seen on MRI. However, without any histological specimens, it was difficult to determine the exact etiology of the lesion. 

CSF analysis pointed in the direction that the etiology was most likely to be inflammatory, and not infectious, and the trial of immunosuppression proved to be successful clinically as well as radiographically. 

It was not until an exacerbation of the disease, when the patient presented with the oral and genital lesions, that the clinical diagnosis of Behcet's disease was made.

The diagnosis led to a further advance in the treatment to lower the steroid dose and augment with Imuran. 

Radiographic follow-up of the lesions proves paramount to fine tune the effective dosages of the medications, thereby preventing the patient from being subjected to subtherapeutic dosages and therefore symptomatic.

This case is a good example of a combined radiographic and clinical diagnosis, as well the value of imaging follow-up - playing a key role in monitoring the course of treatment.
