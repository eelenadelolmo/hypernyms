Upon admission to the hospital after the seizure, the patient was post-ictal. Pertinent physical exam findings were presence of a left facial droop, left upper extremity (UE) strength of 3/5, and slurred speech.  Glasgow Coma Scale was 15 out of 15.
The patient underwent right temporal trephination, intradural exploration and evacuation of the subdural empyema, and placement of an ICP monitor/drain.  The epidural space was absent of pus, but upon entering the subdural space 15-17 cc of luminescent green-yellow pus was drained and was sent for aerobic, anaerobic, and fungal cultures.  

Post-operative treatment included management of increased intracranial pressures, anticonvulsant prophylaxis and IV antibiotic therapy.  Vancomycin 15 mg/kg q8h, Flagyl 500 mg q8h, and Rocephin 2g IV q12h were all started pre-operatively and continued until culture results were available.  On post operative day one, contrast-enhanced CT showed reduction of subdural empyema.  The following day, a normal EEG was obtained and the patient was extubated.  On post-operative day three she was weaned off of 3% saline, and the ventricular drain was removed on post-operative day four.  Antibiotic therapy was changed to IV Meropenem five days post-operatively when subdural anaerobic cultures returned positive for gram positive cocci.  The patient was discharged one week after surgery with Keppra and Meropenem for five more weeks.  Since discharge, the patient has been seen for multiple follow-up appointments where frontal sinus cranialization was recommended but declined. The patient had another episode of CT confirmed sinusitis 6 weeks after her hospitalization that was treated with 3 weeks of Augmentin with no further complications and resolution of sinus complaints. The patient has not had persistent headaches since hospital discharge.
A contrast enhanced CT head was obtained which showed significant enhancement of the cerebral veins in the frontotemporoparietal region, mass effect edema in the right hemisphere with erosion and dehiscence of the inner table of the skull at the level of the frontal sinus (Figure 2), and what was believed to be an epidural abscess (Figure 3).

A 15-year-old girl, with history of sinusitis treated 7 weeks prior, presented to the emergency room after a seizure at school.  The patient reported persistent debilitating headaches daily since the infection.  Additional symptoms included photophobia, intermittent nausea/vomiting, blurred vision, and periorbital pain.  She denied sinus symptoms in the weeks prior to the seizure and had 2 exams in the otolaryngologist‚Äôs office which showed no evidence of sinusitis. MRI of the brain was recommended at the last visit due to the severe nature and duration of the headaches but the family declined as they lacked insurance coverage.

More than two months prior, she had been treated with antibiotics for sinusitis and headaches by her primary care physician (PCP).  Three weeks later she presented to the ED with chief complaint of headache and obtained a CT sinus that showed near-complete opacification of the bilateral maxillary, ethmoid, and frontal sinuses (Figure 1).  It was difficult to exclude a subtle small, low-attenuation epidural collection adjacent to the frontal sinuses.  She was treated for sinusitis and discharged home. When the final CT report was available, contrast enhanced CT or MRI was recommended to rule out a possible small epidural fluid collection.

Subsequently, she was switched to Bactrim by her PCP.  Two weeks prior to admission, the patient was examined by an Otorhinolaryngologist.  She was placed on Augmentin, Medrol dose pack, and Dymista for chronic sinusitis.  

Given the severity of the headaches and lack of sinonasal findings on examination, the patient was sent for a second opinion with another Otolaryngologist.  Again, there was no evidence of sinusitis on examination. MRI of the brain was recommended and balloon sinus dilation with irrigation was discussed to prevent further infections.  The family declined for insurance reasons.
This patient presented with numerous criteria suspicious for SDE, with the exception of a recent sinusitis of less than two weeks.  Our review of reports on SDE secondary to sinusitis found multiple cases of acute sinusitis complicated by SDE [10,14,15].  However, no cases describing a resolved sinusitis subsequently presenting as SDE seven weeks later were found.  In this patient, the intracranial infection is suspected to have originated from a dehiscent left frontal sinus posterior wall allowing the infection to spread intracranially despite resolution of sinusitis.  This mechanism is consistent with the usual pathophysiology of extension of the infection from the frontal sinus to the intracranial space.  

For this patient, the initial unenhanced CT could not exclude subtle small, low-attenuation epidural collections bilaterally adjacent to the frontal sinuses.  A contrast enhanced CT or MRI was recommended to rule out epidural abscess.  This patient did not receive a MRI, despite it being recommended, due to lack of insurance and family‚Äôs concern over cost.  This delay in obtaining contrast-enhanced CT or MRI resulted in delay in the diagnosis of SDE.  Events of this nature are not uncommon.  Being cognizant of a patient‚Äôs financial limitations is a vital aspect of a physician‚Äôs ability to provide effective care.   

This case demonstrates strong interdisciplinary collaboration between neurosurgeon, infectious disease physician, otolaryngologist, radiologist, emergency physician, and critical care physician.  Continued emphasis on interdisciplinary teamwork is essential for optimal patient care.  Physicians in these fields, as well as primary care, should maintain a high index of suspicion for SDE when a patient presents with persistent headache and history of sinusitis. In the future, when considering the signs and symptoms of SDE, it may be necessary to expand the timeframe of recent sinusitis of ?2 weeks to include distant sinusitis up to 7 weeks prior.

Subdural empyema secondary to sinusitis is rare.  When considering SDE, a high index of suspicion is required.  Mortality rates have declined due to increased use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and computed tomography.  However, morbidity rates remain high due to the ability to save patients who previously would not have survived.  In cases of suspected SDE, early contrast-enhanced CT or MRI should be obtained for definitive diagnosis.  Once confirmed, prompt surgical drainage and appropriate antibiotics should be administered. This case teaches us to remain suspicious for SDE even in the situation of resolved sinusitis as remote as seven weeks ago.
