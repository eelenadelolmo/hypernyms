Supine radiograph of the abdomen demonstrates an abnormal gas pattern, with air in the stomach and two additional dilated loops, resembling a “triple bubble” (stomach, dilated duodenum and dilated jejunum). Lack of any air in the distal GI tract is consistent with a proximal small bowel obstruction. No evidence of pneumatosis or secondary signs of free air.
