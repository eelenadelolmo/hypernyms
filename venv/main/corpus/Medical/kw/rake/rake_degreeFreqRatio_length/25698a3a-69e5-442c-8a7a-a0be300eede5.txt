Texto: 
Bulky bilateral neck masses that were tender to palpation.  No associated skin discoloration or open sinus tracts.  Lungs were clear.  No other symptoms.
A fine needle aspiration of the neck was performed and the sample sent for acid fast culture was negative.  PCR testing of the nodal tissue was also negative for mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Bilateral bulky cervical lymphadenopathy involving nodal chains 2 through 5.  Nodes were necrotic with central hypoattenuation and a thick, shaggy rim of enhancement.  Both discrete and confluent matted nodes apparent.
Scrofula (infectious cervical lymphadenitis) caused by M. tuberculosis
• Infections:
» scrofula caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis
» scrofula related to non-tuberculous  (atypical) mycobacteria
» acute HIV infection
» cytomegalovirus (CMV)
» Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
» Bartonella
» endemic fungi

• Autoimmune disorders: 
» lupus
» sarcoidosis

• Malignancy:
» lymphoma
» squamous cell carcinoma

• Uncommon lymph node disorders:
» Kikuchi syndrome
This 23 y.o. woman presented to the ER with 3 months of painful bilateral neck swelling.  Other symptoms included weakness, headaches, dysphagia, and left-sided earache.  She denied fevers, night sweats, myalgias and weight loss.
Imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed no lymphadenopathy or other abnormalities.  

A PPD tuberculin skin test was positive reflecting her exposure to tuberculosis.  Acid fast bacilli blood culture was negative.  An HIV antibody test, monospot, CMV PCR and fungal cultures were negative.  Her ACE level was within normal limits.  An ANA screen was minimally positive at 1:80 and her sedimentation rate was elevated at 40 mm/hr (reference range 0-20).  Her lactic acid dehydrogenase level was elevated at 248 U/L (reference range 135-214).
