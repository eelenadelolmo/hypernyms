Texto: 
Significant TTP at wrist.  Dorsal angulation of wrist and hand on physical exam.
Closed reduction was successful.
Complete transverse fracture of the distal radius with dorsal angulation consistent with a Colles' fracture.  There is overlap of the proximal and distal fracture fragments.  Note significant osteopenia and atherosclerotic disease.

Also, both acute and remote ulnar styloid fractures, the more acute with mild ulnar deviation of distal fracture fragment.  

Finally, there is an incomplete spiral fracture of the distal ulnar which begins at the DRUJ.

Post reduction, near anatomical alignment is restored.
Colles' Fracture
Colles' Fracture
Elderly woman with known osteopenia.  Severe wrist pain after twisting fall.
Unusual addition incomplete distal ulnar fracture is consistent with a twisting element to fall.
