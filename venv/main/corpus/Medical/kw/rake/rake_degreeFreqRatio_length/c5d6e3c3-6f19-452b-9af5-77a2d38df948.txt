Texto: 
afebrile, HCG negative, normal wbc
The patient was treated symptomatically and followed with serial examinations with resolution of mass.
Complex solid and partially cystic adenexal mass with free fluid in the pelvis.
Presumptive hemorrhagic ovarian cyst.
Hemorrhagic cyst
ovarian torsion
cystadenoma, cystadenocarcinoma
endometrioma
abscess or PID less likely given the acute onset of symptoms
appendicitis
hydrosalpinx
G0P0 female presents to the emergency room with acute onset of pelvic pain.
Hemmorhagic cysts are not an uncommon finding associated with pain.  While the more classic features of lace-like or chicken wire internal septations or a fluid-fluid level are not present in this case.  Keeping in mind a broader differential of complex cystic masses of the pelvis listed above in the differential (- ectopic pregnancies as the hCG was negative) is helpful in directing follow up.
