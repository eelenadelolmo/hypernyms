Anterior to the thyroid cartilage, just to the right of midline, there is a fairly well-defined cystlike mass. The mass measures 2.5cm transversely, 1.5 cm anterior to posterior, and 2 cm superior to inferior. No aggressive features noted. Although it appears centered to the right of midline, it does reach midline.
Thyroglossal Duct Cyst
Necrotic Lymph Node (but too big and cystic)
Dermoid Cyst (incorrect signal)
Thymic Cyst (too high)
