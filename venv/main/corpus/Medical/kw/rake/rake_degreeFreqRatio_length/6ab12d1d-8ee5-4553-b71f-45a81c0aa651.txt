Pulmonary Edema assoc with Falciparum Malaria
Falciparum malaria was confirmed on blood smear.
1.  Pulmonary edema
2.  Pneumonia-(viral, mycoplasmal, rickettsial or aspiration)
3.  Inhalational injury (noxious gas/liquid)
4.  Hemorrhage
5.  Drug reaction
20 y/o white male with N/V/D and periodic (every other day or so) fever/chills. Mild chest tightness and dyspnea.
He and other fellow marines were cleaning out old hanger in Liberia. ? about his compliance with mefloquine prophylaxis.
In this case pulmonary edema (along with fever) were the presenting symptoms. Initially the above differential diagnosis could be used for a perihilar (bat's wing pattern).  Pulmonary edema was certainly on the top of the list.  No history of inhalational injury was suggested.  Drug reaction could look similar.  In fact, anti-malarial drugs (mainly sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine) can lead to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary eosinophilia (peripheral lung pattern), and allergic alveolitis.  There was no history of aspiration although other forms of pneumonia couldn't be initially excluded.  No hx of bleeding tendency/comorbid vasculitic disease/or signs of DIC made hemorrhage unlikely.  
The rapid worsening and resolving (later films not shown) certainly suggest pulmonary edema. Overhydration may have contributed to the initial worsening pulmonary edema.
