Patients with normal STOP criteria can be screened annually.
Using TCD study, the patient is risk stratified based on TAMMX(time averaged mean of the maximum velocity) values. 

1. TAMMX <170 cm/s - Normal, Low Risk
2. TAMMX 170 -199 cm/s - Conditional, Moderate Risk
3. TAMMX >200 cm/s - Abnormal, High Risk
 
For this patient, TAMMX values for the intracranial carotid artery, middle cerebral, and anterior cerebral all fall within the normal, low risk category.
This patients TCD results place her in the "normal" category described by STOP.
N/A
Patient is a 5 y/o African American female with an established diagnosis of sickle cell anemia presenting for a annual screening.
TCD and STOP Criteria remain an adequate screening tool.   MRA is more sensitive distinguish stroke risk among patients with abnormal TCD values.
