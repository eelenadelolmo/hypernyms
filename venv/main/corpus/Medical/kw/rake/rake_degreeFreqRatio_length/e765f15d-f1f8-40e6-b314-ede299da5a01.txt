Sonography demonstrates a thickened gallbladder wall with a layering echogenicity consistent with sludge.  No gallstones or intra/extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is present.
Gallbladder wall edema with sludge
Acalculous cholecystitis
Gallbladder wall edema with incidental sludge
59 yo previously healthy male admitted with mental status changes, fevers and abdominal pain.
These images were acquired bedside in the ICU on an intubated patient with generalized edema, that included a small amount of ascites and bilateral pleural effusions.  The edema of the gallbladder wall in this case was felt to represent part of the patient's generalized edema with the sludge secondary to his prolonged NPO status.  If he had not responded to antibiotic treatment, drainage would have been considered.
