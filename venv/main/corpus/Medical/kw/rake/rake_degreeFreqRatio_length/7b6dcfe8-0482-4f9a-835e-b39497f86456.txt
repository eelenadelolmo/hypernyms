EXAM:
-Afebrile with stable vital signs.
-Abdominal exam reveals only tenderness to palpation in the RUQ.

LABS:
-WBC 10.9
-AST/ALT/AlkP: 32 / 56 / 81
-TBili: 0.3
Medical managment with IVF, antibiotics, and analgesia. Patient taken to the OR for Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy the following day.
The gallbladder wall measures approximately 4mm. There is no evidence of cholelithiasis or pericholecystic fluid. The gallbladder demonstrates dependent layering sludge. There is a 10x9 mm echogenic focus within the dependent portion of the gallbladder without posterior shadowing and demonstrates internal flow.

HIDA scan with morphine challenge failed to visualize the gallbladder.
Acute Cholecystitis
Cholecystitis vs. biliary colic vs. gallbladder pathology NOS.
A 53 year old man presents with continuous burning pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen for 4 hours. He reports nausea, but denies vomiting. His last meal was seven hours ago and consisted of "spicy Mexican" food. Past medical history is significant only for GERD.
This case demonstrates the utility of biliary scintigraphy in the diagnosis of cholecystitis. As well, it is serves as a good example for the basic techniques for differentiating gallstones versus adenomatous polyps versus cholesterol polyps.
