Texto: 
BP: 195/92
HR: 74
The patient is mildly obese in no acute distress.  The bilateral upper extremity pulses are 2+/4 and symmetric.  Lower extremity pulses are also present and normal.  The remainder of the examination is normal.

Labs are essentially normal except for a potassium of 2.9 (normal: 3.6 - 5.1).
Type B aortic dissections are generally treated with antihypertensive medications unless there is aortic rupture or renal or visceral vascular compromise.  Follow-up imaging may be required when there is concern for extension of the dissection.
Axial CT images of the aorta after intravenous contrast demonstrate an intimal flap that extends from immediately distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery into the right common iliac artery.
