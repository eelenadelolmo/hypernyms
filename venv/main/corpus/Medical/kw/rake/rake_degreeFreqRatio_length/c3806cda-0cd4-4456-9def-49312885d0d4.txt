Surgical excision is the best treatment for this individual with a symptomatic cavernous hemangioma (Scheuerle 2004). After the surgery she should be followed-up with semi annual ophthalmologic exams that should include fudoscopic and visual field examinations.

Tissue excisional biopsy: RIGHT ORBITAL TUMOR consists of a 1.7 x 1.6 x 1.2 cm well circumscribed, grey/blue nodule. The specimen is unoriented. The surgical margins are inked in black. Serial sectioning reveals a dense, red/brown, clot-like interior. Specimen is consistent with cavernous hemangioma
A well-circumscribed mass of heterogeneous attenuation (soft tissue attenuation as well as bone attenuation) is present within the intraconal region of the right orbit lateral to the optic nerve. This lesion has the following dimensions: 2.1 cm AP by 1.9 cm transverse by 2.1 cm craniocaudal. The surrounding soft tissues, including the extraocular muscles, are within normal limits.  Post-contrast images demonstrate heterogeneous enhancement of this lesion. Exophthalmos is noted with the right globe.
CAVERNOUS HEMANGIOMA
Orbital Dermoid, Orbital Tumors, Cavernous Hemangioma, Metastasis, Lymphoma
41-year-old female bulging eye
Cavernous hemangiomas are the most common intraorbital tumors in adults (Kim 2002). As far as the distribution between men and women is concerned, Henderson (1984) reported an almost equal ratio of 8:7 in women and men, while Harris and Jakobiec (1978) found a 7:3 occurrence ratio of women to men. The lesions themselves are benign vascular lesions that are slow growing and can manifest as a painless, progressively proptotic eye. Most of these tumefactions are unilateral and bilateral cases have rarely been reported.  Orbital cavernous angiomas cause proptosis by increasing the intraorbital volume with a resultant mass effect. Although cavernous hemangiomas are histologically benign, they can encroach on intraorbital or nearby structures and can be considered anatomically malignant.  Therefore surgical excision is merited in most cases for definitive treatment.
