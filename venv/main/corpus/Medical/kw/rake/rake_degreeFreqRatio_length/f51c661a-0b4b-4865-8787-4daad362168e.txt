FOCUSED PE:
Vitals: Afebrile. Otherwise unremarkable. 
ABD - Tender left flank to palpation. No rebound. +BS. 

LAB:
UA - 4+ blood in urine. No nitrites. No leukocytes.
CT (RENAL - TRIPLE PHASE):
NONCONTRAST IMAGING: No renal calculi. 
EARLY ARTERIAL PHASE IMAGING: Bilaterally symmetric early nephrographic phase kidneys. The left kidney is remarkable for a non-enhancing collection, predominantly fluid-attenuation, contiguous with the lower pole which has extension into the posterior retroperitoneum. 
EARLY DELAYED PHASE IMAGING (60 sec): There is delayed excretion of contrast on the left. There is normal excretion of contrast on the right. There is clot in the left extrarenal pelvis which appears to obstruct the proximal ureteral orifice.
LATE DELAYED PHASE IMAGING (3 min): There is evidence of contrast extravasation at the periphery of the collection - focal. 
ADDITIONAL IMAGING AT 19 MIN: Active extravasation of contrast from the collecting system (calyceal rupture)consistent with urinoma.
URINOMA
1) URINOMA
2) HEMATOMA/ACTIVE BLEED
3) ABSCESS
4) SEROMA
2 weeks status post left upper pole nephrectomy with gross hematuria and flank pain.
