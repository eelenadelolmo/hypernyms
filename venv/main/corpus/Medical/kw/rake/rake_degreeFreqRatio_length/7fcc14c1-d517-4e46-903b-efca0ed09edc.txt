Radiographic findings include complete absence of the corpus callosum and cingulate gyrus. There is dilatation of the third ventricle and it is displaced superiorly. There is colpocephaly of the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles. 

Subependymal nodules are noted with in the right lateral ventricle that are isointense to gray matter on all sequences. This is suggestive of heterotopic gray matter.
