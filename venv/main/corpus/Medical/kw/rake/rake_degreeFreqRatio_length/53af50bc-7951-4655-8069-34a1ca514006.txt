Decreased breath sounds over the right upper lung field
Patient was given antibiotics. Patient should be encouraged to do incentive spirometry and be more mobile and walk around.
There is a triangular shaped opacity in the right upper lung field that obscures the ascending aorta. There is also an elevation of the horizontal (minor) fissure, and an elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which are all radiological signs consistent with atelectasis of the right upper lobe.
Right upper lobe atelectasis
Atelectasis can be caused mucous plug, cancer, foreign body, or shallow breathing due to pain or discomfort.
36 year old man with renal cell carcinoma, on dialysis and carbon dioxide retention.
