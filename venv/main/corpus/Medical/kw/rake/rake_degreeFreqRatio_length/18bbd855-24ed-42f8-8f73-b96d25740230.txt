Surgery is planned to reduce the hernia.
Image 1 is an AP chest which demonstrates a large well circumscribed retrocardiac density extending into the right inferior chest region.

Image 2 is a double contrast upper GI radiograph demonstrating a large mixed hiatal hernia with a large paraesophageal component and a small sliding component.  Organoaxial gastric volvulus is also present.
Hiatal hernia, organoaxial gastric volvulus
Based on initial plain radiograph only:

Hiatal hernia
Pericardial cyst
Bronchogenic cyst
Aortic aneurysm or pseudoaneursym
Loculated pleural effusion
Iron deficiency anemia of unknown cause and chest discomfort. Upper GI with small bowel follow through was requested to assist with determination of source of her anemia.
Patient's with hiatal hernia have an increased incidence of iron deficiency anemia.  However, no specific bleeding source was identified on this study.

The patient's chest discomfort was mild and chronic.

Her gastric volvulus appeared to be chronic in nature without symptomatic evidence of acute vascular compromise
