Non contributory with normal neurological exam and no abnormal labs.
SPECT MR of brain is recommended.
2.5 cm x 1.0 cm x 1.0 cm lesion within the right frontal lobe operculum.  The lesion demonstrates decreased signal intensity on T1 images in relationship to the brain. Increased signal intensity is seen on the T2 and FLAIR images.  There is no evidence of enhancement after gadolinium administration.  The lesion involves both gray and subcortical white matter. There is no evidence of flow voids and the lesion demonstrates small mass effect.
