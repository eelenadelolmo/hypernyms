Generalized abdominal tenderness to palpation and peritoneal signs.
Elevated leukocyte count with left shift.
Treatment for uncomplicated cases usually consists of antibiotics (i.e. fluoroquinolones) and bowel rest. This usually involves 2â€“3 days of bowel rest, taking in only clear fluids (no food at all), so the colon may heal without having to work. This is usually done in the out patient setting.

Complicated cases typically involve severe pain, fever, or bleeding, and usually mean generalized peritonitis. Treatment consists of hospitalization and IV antibiotics, bowel rest, and possibly surgery.
The change seen on CT is replacement of the normal pericolic fat by hazy soft-tissue densities. These ill-defined pericolic soft-tissue changes can be compared with the lower density of normal intra-abdominal fat elsewhere (i.e. subcutaneous fat).
