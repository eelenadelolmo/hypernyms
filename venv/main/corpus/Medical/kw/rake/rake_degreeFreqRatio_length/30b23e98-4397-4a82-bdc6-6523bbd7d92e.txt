Unremarkable.
The patient was referred to GI and surgery.
-Following a relatively unremarkable barium swallow, an overhead image was obtained that revealed loops of small bowel confined to the right abdomen and not crossing the midline.  There was no evidence of obstruction or volvulus associated with this finding.
Malrotation
Intestinal malrotation.
86 year old male with complaints of early satiety for about one year.  He denied weight loss over this period and other GI complaints.  The patient was, otherwise, in his usual state of health with no complaints.
While malrotation is high on the differential for infants presenting with GI-related symptoms, it is not routinely considered in the older age groups.  While it is uncertain whether the patient's malrotation is contributing to his complaints of early satiety, it is nevertheless an important finding, even if incidental, given the potential for more severe complications.
