Surgical removal of the loose bodies is sometimes employed, though recurrence is common.
Plain film:  multiple rounded "ossific" densities in the region of the dependent left shoulder joint.

MRI:  Numerous sub-centimeter rounded T1 and T2 hypointense foci in the shoulder joint, with the majority located dependently, in the axillary recess
Idiopathic synovial osteochondromatosis
• Primary (Idiopathic) synovial osteochondromatosis
• Secondary osteochondromatosis
• Pigmented villonodular synovitis
• Chondrosarcoma
• Osteochondritis dissecans
14 y.o. girl with several months of dull left shoulder pain.  No history of trauma, and the pain is not specific to any particular activity or sport.
Given the patient's young age, related lack of osteoarthritic changes, and the numerous similarly-sized densities, the findings are consistent with primary synovial osteochondromatosis.
