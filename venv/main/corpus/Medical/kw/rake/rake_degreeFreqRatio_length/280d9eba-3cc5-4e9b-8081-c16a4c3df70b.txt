Mild ataxia
Conservative
• Subacute left cerebellar hematoma on CT and MRI scans
• Contrast MRI reveals large developmental venous anomaly (DVA) just superior to the hematoma.
Intracranial Venous Anomaly or Malformation ,   Developmental Venous Anomaly
• Traumatic hemorrhage
• Metastatic disease
• Primary neoplasm hemorrhage (e.g. GBM, Oligo, etc.)
• AVM or other vascular malformation
• Hypertensive hemorrhage
• Amyloid angiopathy
56 y.o. man with sudden onset occipital headache.
Brief loss of consciousness
It is most likely that the hematoma resulted from a cavernous angioma which is frequently associated with many DVAs.  Due to the hematoma itself the suspected cavernous angioma is often not readily appreciated.
