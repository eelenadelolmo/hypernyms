Lungs CTA bilaterally on exam

Chem panel was significant for elevated LFTs
Steroid therapy
Ultrasound image demonstrates a heterogenous appearance of the liver.  There is a question of diffuse low echotexture to the liver (a "starry sky" appearance) which may suggest edema.  It is difficult to exclude confluent hypoechoic nodules.

CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis demonstrates bilateral mediastinal adenopathy and innumerable small hypoattenuating nodules throughout the liver and spleen.
Sarcoidosis

- Metastatic disease
- Lymphoma
- Sarcoidosis
- Tuberculosis
38 year old woman with intermittent cough, shortness of breath, and vague abdominal discomfort.
Usually, seeing evidence of sarcoidosis in the liver or spleen on imaging studies implies more aggressive disease.
