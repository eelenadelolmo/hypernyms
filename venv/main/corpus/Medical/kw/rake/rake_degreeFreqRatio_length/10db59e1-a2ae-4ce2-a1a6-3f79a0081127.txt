Texto: 
Physical exam provided no evidence of bony trauma or ligamentous instability.
Follow-up radiographs and consultation with orthopedic surgeon if patient becomes symptomatic.
Lateral radiograph of right leg shows a well-defined  lytic lesion in the posterior cortex of the distal tibial diaphysis.  The lesion has a bilobular appearance with a sclerotic border.
Nonossifying fibroma
*Fibrous cortical defect (defined as 0-2 cm and confined to cortex)
*Nonossifying fibroma (lesion >2 cm OR not confined to cortex)
*Osteoblastoma (suggested by ossification and calcification) 
*Adamantinoma (suggested by medullary invasion)
Patient developed acute pain in right knee while playing basketball, and radiographs were obtained.
