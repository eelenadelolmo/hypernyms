Non-contributory.
Patient was referred to vascular surgery for further evaluation and management.
CECT of the pelvis demonstrated an incidental finding of abnormal contrast concentration within the right femoral vein during the arterial phase of enhancement. Subsequent angiogram demonstrated abnormal early opacification of the IVC during flush aortagram as well as abnormal communication between the right profunda femoris artery and femoral vein.
Arteriovenous Fistula (angiographically confirmed)
AVF
