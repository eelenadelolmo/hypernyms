Labs were normal.
No treatment was necessary at this point.  There is no need for routine follow-up for AML < 3cm, unless symptoms arise.  Hemorrhage is the most common complication of the angiomyolipomas - and lesions larger than 3cm may be resected to reduce risk of hemorrhage.
Images demonstrate bilateral masses arising from the kidneys.  The masses are heterogeneous in density, containing soft tissue and fatty elements.  Portions of the masses enhance upon administration of IV contrast. Incidentally, the mass seen in the lateral right kidney demonstrates regions of fat attenuation on other images.  The patient also demonstrates multiple calcified subependymal nodules on non-contrast head CT.
Tuberous Sclerosis (TS), renal angiomyolipoma (AML)
• Lipoma
• Angiomyolipoma
• Renal cell carcinomas
• Lymphoma
• Metastases
23 y.o. man with a known disease had these images obtained for routine follow-up.  He was asymptomatic.
The macroscopic fat within these bilateral masses makes them consistent with angiomyolipomas.  Rarely, renal cell carcinomas may engulf adjacent fat.  Neither lymphoma nor metastases would be expected to contain fat.  The bilateral nature of the lesions is consistent with tuberous sclerosis.  This patient also displayed multiple calcified subependymal nodules or tubers within the ventricular system of the brain, an additional finding associated with tuberous sclerosis.
