Texto: 
non-enlarged, non-tender thyroid gland with irregular texture without a dominant nodule.

TSH slightly below normal limits
free T4 slightly above normal limits
Planar and pinhole images of the thyroid bed after the administration of I-123 demonstrate somewhat heterogeneous uptake of radiotracer in both lobes of the gland, with decreased thyroid-to-background ratio.  The 4-hour and 24-hour uptake were 1% and 4%, respectively
amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism
amiodarone-induced thyroiditis
increased iodine pool due to amiodarone
85 y.o. white female w/ prior h/o multinodular goiter, w/ recent history of ventricular arrhythmias treated with amiodarone and a placement of a pacemaker.  Review of systems is unremarkable.
