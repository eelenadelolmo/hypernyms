Limited physical exam due to body habitus - Fever - Normal WBC
Nonsurgical, supportive care.
The appendix is normal in size and caliber in a retrocecal location and there is no periappendiceal fluid or adjacent fat stranding to suggest appendicitis. Gas and contrast are present within the lumen.

Scattered mesenteric lymph nodes which are nonpathologic by size criteria but abnormal in number are present with a right lower quadrant predominance. Inguinal lymph nodes are also present.
Mesenteric Adenitis
Mesenteric Adenitis
Obese 10 year-old female with emesis and abdominal pain for 2 days.
Due to significant obesity, the patient proceeded directly to CT instead of undergoing US evaluation.  Intraabdominal fat assisted evaluation of the appendix and mesentery by CT.
