Unknown
Surgical resection of the mass was performed and pathologically confirmed as an ependymoma.
» large, intradural, enhancing mass with complex signal characteristics and includes both cystic and solid components
» possibly originating in the filum terminale
» layering debris at the caudal posrtion of the cystic component
» hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images
» complex signal on the T1-weighted images
» lacking enhancement beyond what is represented as T1-bright following gadolinium
Ependymoma, with scattered myxopapillary features
Intradural-extramedullary Mass:
» Ependymoma
» Myxopapillary Ependymoma
» Schwannoma
» Meningioma
» Paraganglioma
The patient is a 27 year old woman with a three-week history of low back pain following a rock-climbing event
Myxopapillary ependymomas which account for the vast majority of neoplasms in the caudal portions of the cord and have been known to hemorrhage.  As noted in the findings, layering debris at the dependent portion of the caudal, cystic component of this mass was visualized, and felt to represent hemorrhage.  The final pathology report concluded the lesion was an ependymoma, with scattered myxopapillary features.  It is possible that this hemorrhage was the event that precipitated the patients recent symptoms and prompted her to seek medical attention.
