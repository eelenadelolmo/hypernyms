Bilateral disc edema; Left eye > Right eye
Visual fields were normal
As the patient&#39;s Chiari malformation appears to be asymptomatic, no further treatment is indicated at this time. Routine follow up with Ophthalmology to screen for visual changes and track fundoscopic findings is recommended. B-scan ultrasound or optical coherence tomography (OCT) could be considered in determining an etiology if it would change management of the patient. It is also worth monitoring for reported headaches or other symptoms that could indicate an increased intracranial pressure secondary to the Chiari malformation.
Neuroimaging was ordered to evaluate for possible etiology of suspected papilledema. 

MRI showed bilateral cerebellar tonsillar descent more prominent on the right side and estimated at 8 mm. Visualized portions of the cervical cord were unremarkable. Impression is a Chiari Type I Malformation with right side greater than the left.
Type I Chiari Malformation
Papilledema secondary to Chiari Malformation
Drusen with coincidental Chiari Malformation
Narrowed scleral canal with coincidental Chiari Malformation
A 10-year-old girl with no significant past medical history presented for a routine eye exam. She denied history of headache or vision changes. No reports of neurologic deficits.
When diagnosing papilledema, two causes of pseudo-papilledema must be ruled out for definitive diagnosis. Both drusen and a narrow scleral canal can appear very similar to papilledema on fundoscopic exam. Drusen are intrapapillary proteinaceous bodies which lie deep within the tissue of the optic disc and commonly present as pseudo-papilledema in children. Drusen can cause enlargement of the blind spot. Narrowing of the scleral canal causes crowding of the axons as they exit the canal and can appear as a raised optic disc, however the axons themselves are of normal size and no visual deficits are present. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) or a B-scan ultrasound is helpful in determining a definitive diagnosis.  

Our 10-year-old patient with no complaints of headache or visual changes, could very well have presented in the incipient stage of papilledema secondary to increased intracranial pressure caused by her CM1. However, as no B-scan, lumbar puncture, or OCT was performed it is difficult to make this conclusion. Both the presence of drusen and a narrow scleral canal must be considered in the differential diagnosis with the CM1 simply being an incidental finding. It is notable that Chiari I malformations are sometimes interpreted as a coincidental finding in patients with papilledema; perhaps we are dismissing a potential pathologic link between the two. Given the asymptomatic nature of our patient’s CM1, this patient warrants routine follow up for potential changes in vision and other symptoms of a CM1. An OCT or B-scan could be indicated in the future if disc edema does not resolve in order to make a definitive diagnosis.
