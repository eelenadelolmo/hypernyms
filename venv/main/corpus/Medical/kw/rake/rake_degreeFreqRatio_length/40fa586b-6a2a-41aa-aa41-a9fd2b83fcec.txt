Left-sided foot drop.
Patient underwent resection of the mass and is being treated with phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis.  The patient has had a follow up MRI to assess for residual tumor.
Noncontrast head CT demonstrates a large right temporal mass with subfalcine and uncal herniation from right to left.  The mass is heterogenous with several curvilinear areas of calcification and surrounding vasogenic edema.  

The MRI images again demonstrate signal heterogenity with partial central necrosis.  The lesion produces moderate-to-severe mass effect with effacement of the left lateral ventricle, and subfalcine and transtentorial herniation.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
Astrocytoma
Oligodendroglioma
Metastastic disease, partially hemorrhagic lesion
Primary CNS lymphoma
44-year old woman with several week history of headaches.  Patient developed a left-sided foot drop approximately one-week prior to presenting to her physician.
Glioblastoma Multiforme is the most common primary brain tumor.  Approximately 50% of astrocytomas are GBMs.  These tumors normally occur in patients over 50.  This patient, at 44-years old, is at the younger end of the age spectrum.

These lesions are varied in their appearance secondary to their multiple pathologic forms.  However, they typically are highly vascular with edema and hemorrhage being common.  They demonstrate strong, heterogeneous enhancement.  Calcification is rare, although this lesion did demonstrate several areas of calcification.

This lesion does not cross the corpus callosum, although it is one of two intracranial neoplasms, along with primary CNS lymphma, that can extend through white matter tracts and involve both hemispheres.
