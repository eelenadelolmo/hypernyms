Scaphoid abdomen with localized epigastric distention
Surgical repair via duodenoduodenostomy
• Abdomen, portable
Portable frontal x-ray of abdomen demonstrates abnormal bowel gas pattern with large gastric bubble and no appreciable bowel gas in remainder of abdomen. 

• Abdomen, portable
Air visualized within gastric bubble and terminates abruptly in proximal duodenum consistent with double-bubble sign. Dilated duodenal bulb indicates chronic obstruction.

• Limited fluoroscopic upper GI series, pre-op
Antegrade movement of contrast through pylorus to first part of duodenum with no further antegrade movement during study.
Duodenal Atresia
Double bubble (by definition, no distal gas) is diagnostic of Duodenal Atresia, but if the obstruction were not complete, the following diagnoses would also merit consideration.

Duodenal stenosis
Duodenal obstruction secondary to annular pancreas
Preduodenal portal vein
Jejunal atresia with fluid in jejunum
Malrotation with midgut volvulus
5 day old premature male infant delivered at gestational age 28+1 weeks by emergent C-section section due to fetal distress. Stabilized in NICU and on TPN.
Patient's presentation was delayed because he was premature and put on TPN. He did not begin oral intake until DOL #3.
