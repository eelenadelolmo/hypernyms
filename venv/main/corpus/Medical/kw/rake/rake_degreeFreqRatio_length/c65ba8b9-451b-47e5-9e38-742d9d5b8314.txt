Infectious enteritis, colitis, intussusception, appendicitis
Appendicitis is the most frequent abdominal process requiring surgery in the pediatric population.   Although the diagnosis can be clinically evident in 80% of patients, imaging using mostly plain film, ultrasound and CT can aid in the diagnosis. Findings can include appendiceal calculus, appendiceal abscess, periappendiceal soft tissue mass, small and/or large bowel obstruction, ileus, intraperitoneal fluid, obliteration of the psoas shadow, splinting of the lumbosacral spine, and a dilated blind-ending tubular structure measuring more than 6mm on sonographic examination
Acute appendicitis with an appendicolith
9 yo male with history of abdominal pain for 3 days that is localized to the RLQ.  Please assess for possible appendicitis.
