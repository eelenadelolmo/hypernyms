Head: Macrocephalic; significant flattening of the right occipital region of the skull; anterior fontanelle open, 2x3cm and flat; head did not transilluminate
Neuro: 3+ DTRs in the lower extremities bilaterally
A ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was placed after imaging confirmed the diagnosis.  An MRI without contrast at 21 months showed no significant changes in the size of the monoventricle or of the extra-axial fluid collection.
CT scan showed fusion of the cerebral hemispheres in the midline anteriorly.  The occipital and temporal lobes were partially developed.  There was lack of development of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles, and a monoventricle was present.  The thalami were not fused, and a tiny rudimentary third ventricle was present.  No corpus callosum was noted.  The monoventricle communicated with a CSF collection posteriorly.  There were also large extra-axial fluid collections along the anterior aspect of the brain.  The cerebellum, brainstem and fourth ventricle were normal in appearance.
Semilobar Holoprosencephaly
Lobar holoprosencephaly
Alobar holoprosencephaly
Hydrocephalus
A 9 month old Caucasian female presented with developmental delay and macrocephaly.  A CT scan was ordered to rule out hydrocephalus.
This patient presented at 9 months with developmental delay and macrocephaly.  After CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of semi-lobar holoprosencephaly, a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was placed in an attempt to reduce the extra-axial fluid collection.  The MRI without contrast at 21 months showed no change in the size of the monoventricle or extra-axial fluid collection.  In the interim between the CT scan and the MRI the patient continued to experience a delay in motor development, and also began experiencing feeding difficulties and a seizure disorder.
