PA and lateral radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiac silhouette and calcification of the aortic arch.  Calcification is consistent with atherosclerotic disease.  The lungs demonstrate a honeycomb pattern in the bases.  Calcified granulomas are present.  There are soft tissue densities with internal popcorn calcifications present in the right lower lobe and right upper lobe.  The right posterior fifth rib is hypoplastic or demonstrates post surgical changes.  A Greenfield filter is in place.  Fusion hardware is present in the lumbar spine.  No prior radiographs were available for comparison.
