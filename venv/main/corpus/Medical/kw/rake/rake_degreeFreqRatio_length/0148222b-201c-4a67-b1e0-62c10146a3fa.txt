Patient is 6’4 inches and weighs 194 pounds.  Patient used a walker to get around.  Blood pressure in left arm was 220/140.  Patient was advised to get blood pressure managed at emergency department immediately after examination.

HEENT : Normocephalic, atraumatic

Pulmonary : Patient was breathing comfortably without the use of accessory muscles. 

Musculoskeletal

Patient did not appear to have any visible deformities of limbs, abdomen or chest.

Ranges of motion were evaluated using dual inclinometry and findings were compared to the AMA Guides Evaluation of Permanent Impairment 5th edition.  

Lumbar range of motion:
•	Flexion : 37°/60°
•	Left lateral bending : 16°/25°
•	Right lateral bending : 2°/25°
•	Extension : 8°/25° 
Muscle spasms were noted over the lumbosacral regions paraspinally.

Lower extremities: 
•	Unable to perform figure 4 procedure due to lower back and right hip pain when the right side was tested
•	Straight leg raise on the left side could be accomplished to 30° with report of right lower extremity pain extending to the foot. 
•	Straight leg raise on the right side could not be tested as a 0° neutral position could not be obtained.  Right hip remained flexed at 30°.  
•	Muscle strength of extensor and flexor hallucis revealed weakness of right flexor hallucis graded 4/5.
•	Sensory examination revealed diffuse hypesthesia of L4-S1 dermatome.
•	Patrick’s test was positive on the right
•	Significant trophic skin changes  in both the distal lower extremities with extremely dry and crackled skin as well as a small ulceration on the left plantar surface of 
        the foot.

Neurologic:
•	Reflexes:
o	Biceps: 2/4 bilaterally
o	Triceps: 2/4 bilaterally
o	Patellar: ¼ on the right 2/4 on the left
o	Achilles: 1/4 bilaterally
The patient’s lumbar back pain will initially be managed initially with oral analgesics.  Diathermy of lumbar spine and lumbar spinal orthoses will also be considered.  Chiropractic manipulation is provided for the spinal areas to provide mobilization and relief of neural irritation.  The patient’s hip was aggravated due to the MVA and the patient is being sent for orthopedic surgical referral of the hip.  The patient reported full movement of the right hip prior to the MVA and since the MVA has had the right hip in a position of   30°  flexion being unable to place the thigh flat on the table in the supine position.      While awaiting surgical consultation  pain medication can adequately be used for both hip and back pain. 
 With regard to the polyneuropathy noted on EMG the patient has been sent to his primary care physician for further laboratory evaluation.

Lumbar radiculopathy due to lumbar disc herniation, Protrusio Acetabuli
The patients lower back pain was described as sharp and shooting from the lower back down to the right foot.  The pain is worse with lifting, walking, standing, twisting of waist.  Pain is improved with pain medication, rest, and muscle relaxants.
The prominent physical exam findings showed limited ROM of the lumbar spine.  Weakness of the right flexor/extensor hallucis.  Diminished Achilles reflex.  Patient had electrophysiological studies done, which did not show evidence of lumbar radiculopathy.   The electrophysiological studies showed several bilateral lower extremity sensory motor peripheral polyneuropathy with primary demyelinating features and further studies to determine the etiology were pending.  The studies also showed no signs of radiculopathy.
With the findings in history and physical exam the differential includes lumbar radiculopathy possibly due to disc herniation  or lumbar subluxation.  The radiculopathy the patient is experiencing may also be from a chronic process such as degenerative disc disease or spinal stenosis.  A less likely diagnosis for the patients back pain would be lumbar strain because the patient presented with radiating shooting pain.  The diagnosis of polyneuropathy is high on the differential because of the electrophysiological study findings.  
The imaging findings confirm the diagnosis that there is left sided disc herniation at L4-L5 and central disc herniation at L5-S1.  The left sided disc herniation is most likely causing chemical radiculopathy which lead to the radicular symptoms on the right side.  The central disc herniation at the L5 nerve root would support compressive radiculopathy that is causing symptoms on the right limb.  Weakness of right flexor hallucis, and diminished Achilles supports lumbar radiculopathy as the working diagnosis.
As for the patient’s localized hip pain, the differential includes fracture, trochanteric bursitis, and osteoarthritis, referred lumbosacral back pain.
The imaging findings show old fracture deformity of protrusion acetabulI.  No acute fracture was noted and internal fixation device from previous fracture repair was intact.  Therefore, the right hip pain is likely due to protrusion acetabula or referred lumbosacral back pain

This patient presented with neck, back, and hip pain after a motor vehicle accident.  The lower back pain was described as shooting down to the right foot.  This describes lumbar radiculopathy is when there is compression of the lumbar nerve root (1). The patient’s symptamtology and physical exam findings support the diagnosis for lumbar radiculopathy.  The shooting pain down the leg, weakness of right flexor and extensor hallus, diminished Achilles reflex, positive reverse straight leg raise.
The patient’s imaging findings show that there is compression of the L4 and L5 nerve root due to disc herniation.  L4 radiculopathy presents with lower back that often radiates to the anterior aspect of the thigh down into the knee and occasionally down the medial aspect of the lower leg.  Examination can show weakness of hip flexion, hip extension, and hip adduction.  Sensation may also be reduced over the anterior aspect of the thigh down to the medial aspect of the lower leg. Patient’s that do present with weakness often have diminished patellar reflex (2).
L5 radiculopathy is the most common radiculopathy affecting lumbar spine.  It typically presents with lower back that radiates down to the lateral aspect of the leg into the foot.  On examination, there can be weakness of foot dorsiflexion toe extension, foot inversion, and foot eversion.  There may also be weakness of leg abduction in severe cases.  Sensory loss is on the lateral aspect of the lower leg and dorsum of the foot.  Reflexes are generally normal (2).
The patient presented with lower back that radiated down to the foot, which is consistent with L5 radiculopathy.   The weaknesses of the right flexor and extensor hallus are consistent with L5 radiculopathy.  The patient also had 1+ patellar reflex consistent with L4 radiculopathy.  The patient did not present with any sensory deficits.
However, with the patient’s history of prior hip fracture and the imaging findings of the pelvic showing protrusion acetabula, it may be difficult differentiating the patient’s pain pattern from arising from protrusio acetabula versus lumbar radiculopathy.
The hip pain may be due to the protrusion acetabula or referred pain from the lumbosacral spine.   The lower lumbar roots refer pain to the gluteas and posterolateral areas.  Referred pain from the back should be suspected because the pain that shoots down his lower leg extends past the knee and examination of the hip joints were unremarkable (3).  
Another helpful diagnostic measure is the physical exam maneuvers to help differentiate hip pain from referred lumbar sacral spine pain.  The patient was unable to perform the straight leg raise on the right side due the inability to place the thigh flat on the table.  The straight leg raise is more sensitive and less specific than the reverse straight leg raise for diagnosing disc herniation (4).  The test is most useful in evaluating L5 and S1 nerve root compression.  One prospective test showed that out of the 100 patients with disc herniation, the positive straight leg raise was positive in 83 percent (6).  
Nerve conduction studies and electromyography may help differentiate from localized hip pain and lumbar radiculopathy.  The utility of these studies are when patients present with lumbar radiculopathy along with weakness for greater than three weeks.  For patients with non specific back pain, these studies can be used to differentiate nerve pain from pain related to muscular effort.  EMG and imaging studies have comparable sensitivities varying between 50-85 percent , depending on patient population (2,6).  The patient's EMG studies were negative for radiculopathy, but clinically the patient shows signs for radiculopathy.
The imaging for disc herniation through CT and MRI reveals both are sensitive (7).   MRI is used as routine initial assessment because it can detect intraspinal pathology such as inflammatory, malignant, and vascular disorders.  The patient had an MRI of the lumbar spine which was able to confirm the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation.
Diagnosis of protrusion acetabuli is made on the basis of an anteroposteior radiograph of the pelvis and in this case further defined by the CT scan of the right hip.  A center-edge angle of greater than 40 degrees is diagnostic and migration of the femoral head past  the medial wall of the acetabulum and the ilioischial line (kohlers line) (8).  These findings are seen in the patient anteroposterior radiographs of the pelvis.  Overall sensitivity of needle EMG in the diagnosis of radiculopathy is in the range of 50% and 71%. Based on these sensitivities, it is important to recognize that a negative EMG study does not rule out the presence of radiculopathy [9].
