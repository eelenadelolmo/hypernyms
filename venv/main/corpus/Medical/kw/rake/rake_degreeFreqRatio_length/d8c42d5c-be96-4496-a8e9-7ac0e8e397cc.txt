No findings
Lesion resected.
PA and lateral chest films were unremarkable. 
Lingular bronchial lesion. No associated calcifications. Post obstructive air trapping in lingula.
Endobronchial Tumors
Neoplasm (benign or malignant. Unlikley mucous plug or foreign body given symptomatology.
23 yo male with recurrent hemoptysis.
Endobronchial lesions: 
 - Tumors 80%, Inflammatory 20%
 - Less than 10% of tumors are benign
 
Benign: Squamous cell papilloma - most common
        Hamartomas 
        Pleomorphic adenoma

Malignant: Squamous cell carcinoma - most common
           Adenoid cystic carcinoma
           Mucoepidermoid carinoma
           Carccinoma

Ball valve phenomenon can generate distal air trapping. During exhalation the bronchial caliber decreases. This combined with endobronchial lesion can partially or completely occlude the bronchial lumen generating peripheral air trapping.
