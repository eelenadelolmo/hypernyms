Tender to palpation over C1-C3, no neurological deficits.  No other significant findings
The essential priority in initial care of patients with potential spinal cord injury is to maintain strict immobilization of the entire spine. This immobilization is most often initiated in the field, which was not implemented in this patient. As soon as practical, and often before extrication is complete, the neck should be immobilized in a cervical collar, and the patient secured to a full-length backboard. The head is maintained in neutral position in the midline. Before transportation, the patient's body is securely strapped at all major joints, the head is taped to the board, and sandbags may be applied alongside the head. On arrival in the emergency department, the protective cocoon must be partially removed to allow assessment of the patient, but it is critical that the immobilization of the spine be maintained until an unstable injury has been ruled out both by radiologic and clinical examination. In the cervical spine, it is essential for the radiographs to include all seven cervical vertebrae, down to and including the articulation between C7 and T1. The lower portion of the cervical spine is often difficult to visualize well on lateral views, especially in large patients. If the region of C7 to T1 is not visualized, there is potential for dramatic missed injury. Under these circumstances, or if findings on plain films are equivocal, CT is a useful adjunct.
C-spine CT- multiple fractures on C1, bilateral posterior ring, right anterior ring.  Fragmentation on right side of C1 into spinal canal, spinal cord intact.  All other cervical vertebrae intact and without compromise.
Multiple C1 fractures
Multiple C1 fractures
21 yo WM was entering the surf when a wave crashed directly on top of him.  Patient was violently toppled over and struck his head on the sandy shore.  Patient denies loss of consciousness or aspiration.  He immediately felt bilateral paracervical neck pain upon impact on his head onto the shore.  Patient emerged from the ocean under own strength and without any other complaints.  He was promptly taken to the ED in ambulance without cervical spine precautions.
