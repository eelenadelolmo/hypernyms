Texto: 
She is alert and oriented, in no acute distress. HEAD: She has a left inferior laterally displaced globe with severe proptosis. She has moderate periorbital edema and erythema. Cranial nerves 2 through 12 are intact. 
EYES: Extraocular muscles restricted. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. She again has an inferior lateral displaced globe. She has edema and erythema which is periorbital. Her vision is spotty. She can only see peripherally.
EARS: External auditory canals clear bilaterally. NOSE: Septum is midline. No masses and no drainage. ORAL CAVITY/OROPHARYNX: Mucosa is pink and moist. No masses in floor of mouth or base of tongue. 
NECK: She has minimal lymphadenopathy and is slightly tender at the level of 2 and 3.
Excision and drainage.
There is expansion of the left frontal sinus with extension into the upper aspect of the left ethmoid air cells. Impression of the globe with considerable proptosis is identified. There is some absence of bone posteriorly and medially although dura is probably present covering this large probable mucocele. There is also indentation into the lateral wall of the inferior aspect of the left ethmoid air cell group by fat that may represent a response to long standing proptosis. The left nasolacrimal duct is poorly defined and distortion or obstruction of the latter cannot be excluded.
Mucocele
* mucocele
* infection
* trauma
