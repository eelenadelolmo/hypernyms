The patient had multiple upper thigh, vulvar, and perineal varices.
Successful coil embolization of gonadal veins with subsequent resolution of patient symptoms.
Pelvic venogram demonstrates enlarged left gonadal vein measuring 9mm in diameter with prominent cross filling pelvic varices.
Pelvic Congestion Syndrome
Other causes of pelvic pain such as fibroids or interstitial cystitis.
34yF with approximately 1yr h/o vulvar and perineal varices exacerbated by prolonged standing, as well as painful intercourse. She had severe pelvic "heaviness" after standing for prolonged periods of time.
Pelvic congestion syndrome is a clinical entity not well understood by most health care providers. Onset is typically in adulthood, and thought to be caused by childbirth. Patients present with chronic pelvic pain and dyspareunia. As they may be quite symptomatic with no real physical findings, patients are often dismissed as having supratentorial issues. Treatment can be with open or laparoscopic sugery with ligation of the gonadal veins, or via catheter directed embolization as in this case. Some operators choose to sclerose the internal iliac veins as well. Most patients claim at least modest relief of symptoms following embolization.

This patient had resolution of her varices and is currently contemplating sclerosis of her internal iliac veins.
