Referral to OB/Gyn and official exposure evaluation and dosage report by radiology department physicist.
Radiograph of the pelvis demonstrates the skeletal outline of an intrauterine pregnancy.
Intrauterine pregnancy
• Intrauterine pregnancy
• Ectopic pregnancy
• Lithopedion
A young woman (23 y.o.) went to her physician for several weeks of hip pain.   She has been exercising lately; and, she is trying to "get back into shape".
Patient denied she could be pregnant prior to radiograph of hip. Patient was given option to have a urine dipstick pregnancy test and she declined and signed a waiver stating said fact. Following exposure of the fetus, the patient was given official dosage report/evaluation by the departmental physicist. The fetus/uterus absorbed a dose of 1.7 mGy/170 mrad for an effective dose of 1.1 mSv/110 mrem. 

Exposure in utero from diagnostic xray are lower than 50 mGy/5 rad and have not been demonstrated to produce any significant impact on fetal growth and development.
