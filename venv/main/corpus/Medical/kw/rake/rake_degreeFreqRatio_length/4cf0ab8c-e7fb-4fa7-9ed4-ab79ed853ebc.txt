Texto: 
Nipples slightly elevated bilaterally.  Abnormal distribution of glandular tissue, with somewhat of a swirling pattern inferiorly on the MLO view bilaterally, most notable on right ML view.  Abnormal linear bands in the retroglandular fat bilaterally.  Skin thickening/scar in the six oâ€™clock regions.  Oil cyst with microcalcifications on the right.
Fat Necrosis
1) Oil cyst with benign calcifications (fat necrosis) status post Reduction Mammoplasty
2) Microcalcifications from malignancy
54 year-old female with history of bilateral reduction mammoplasty presents for routine screening mammogram.
This case is also an excellent example of reduction mammoplasty, and has been submitted under another factoid labelled as such.
