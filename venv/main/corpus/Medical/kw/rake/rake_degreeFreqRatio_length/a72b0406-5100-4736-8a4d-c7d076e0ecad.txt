Elevated total bilirubin of 12.5 mg/dL with a mildly elevated AST and ALT.  Alkaline phosphatase was normal.
Treatment of hepatic insufficiency involves preventing the precipitating causes such as preventing hepatic ischemia, controlling sepsis,  regulating mean arterial pressure, monitoring metabolic parameters, and monitoring therapeutic measures that could cause hepatic injury such as IV nutrition, mechanical ventilation, and catacholamine administration.
Following the administration of 6.0 mCi of Tc99m mebrofenin IV, serial anterior and delayed anterior images of the liver were obtained.  The images show persistence of radiotracer within the blood pool.  This is best appreciated by persistent radiotracer uptake within the heart.  There is virtually no hepatic extraction or secretion of radiotracer from the liver.  Blood pool clearance should occur by 5 minutes.  The grossly abnormal delay in clearance is consistent with severe hepatic insufficiency.
Hepatic Insufficiency
Acute viral hepatitis
Chronic active hepatitis
Cirrhosis
Shock liver in a critically ill patient
Hepatic ischemia
Drug reaction
Alcoholic hepatitis
Severe high grade biliary obstruction
Status post multitrauma from an improvised explosive device.  The patient was intubated in the ICU.
Evaluation of the liver on HIDA scans involves evaluating blood flow to the liver, hepatic extraction, biliary excretion, patency of the biliary tract, and gallbladder function.  The liver is normally seen 6-8 seconds after the spleen and kidneys.  Normal hepatic extraction of radiotracer from the blood pool should occur by 5-10 minutes.  A delay in blood pool clearance is a sign of hepatic insufficiency.  Radiotracer is visualized within the heart at 16 hours signifying the fact that very little blood pool clearance has occurred.  This patient has such severe hepatic insufficiency that almost no hepatic extraction occurs.
