Texto: 
Patient currently being treated with tamoxifen and Xgeva.
MRI Brain with contrast showed an enhancing widespread pachymeningeal thickening with predominance in the cerebral convexities along with involvement of the anterior falx and sparing of the posterior falx and tentorium. Some small, nonenhancing foci were seen on FLAIR sequence within the brain parenchyma. No hydrocephalus or ischemia noted. Heterogeneous abnormal enhancement and signal intensity observed within the marrow spaces of the calvarium.
Carcinomatous meningitis (leptomeningeal metastases)
-infectious meningitis/meningoencephalitis due to fungal, bacterial, or viral causes
-carcinomatous meningitis
Patient presents with headaches and a history of known metastatic breast cancer.
