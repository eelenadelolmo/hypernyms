Pysical exam reveals a well-circumscribed lesion on the right tip of the nose.  The baby is otherise healthy and developing normally.
Followup will likely include repeat imaging at some point in the feature.  However, no treatment or further imaging has been obtained at this time.
MRI imaging demonstrates widely separated lateral ventricles and a hyperintense, midline intracranial mass between the lateral ventricles.  It is in the expected location of the corpus callosum, which is absent.  This mass follows fat signal on all sequences and demonstrates signal loss on fat suppression sequences.
Intracranial Lipoma
Intracranial Lipoma
Intracranial Dermoid
3-month old male born at full term without complications presents with small bump on the tip of his nose identified as a dermoid cyst.  Imaging was requested to evaluate for possible intracranial extension.
Intracranial lipomas are thought to represent persistence of the menix primativa, a mesenchymal neural crest derivative, and are a type of brain malformation, rather than a true neoplasm.  30% of all intracranial lipomas occur in the callosal area.  Half of these occur with various degrees of callosal dysgenesis. Agenesis or hypogenesis of the corpus callosum can occur in up to 90% of patients with large anterior lipomas, as in this case.  Absence of posterior crossing tracks may lead to abnormal development of the adjacent parietal and occipital white matter.  Lipomas can be clinically diagnosed in all ages.  Patients may present with headaches, seizure or learning disabilities.  Other times, lipomas may be discovered incidentally on imaging obtained for other reasons.

CT scans demonstrate the characteristic findings of callosal agenesis associated with a fat density mass that is variably calcified.

MRI imaging will demonstrate a midline mass that follows fat signal on all sequences, as well as, signal loss on fat suppression sequences.
