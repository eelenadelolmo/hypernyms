No concerning mass or enhancement was demonstrated.  A previously performed ultrasound of the breast demonstrated no underlying mass in the periareolar region of patient's pain.  Given these findings the MR fits a BIRADS category 2 for benign findings.
Multiple well circumscribed foci of nonenhancing, increased T2 signal on STIR and decreased signal on T2 fat suppressed sequences in the breasts without skin thickening.

No concerning areas of enhancement on post gadolinium sequences.
Siliconomas:  Silicone granulomas from direct intramammary silicone injection breast augmentation
Injected silicone
Extracapsular silicone rupture
59 year old Asian woman with history of breast augmentation and subareolar pain.
Imaging of silicone has characteristic signal properties with increased signal on T2WI, decreased signal on fat suppressed T2WI and T1WI.

Silicone breast injections are common in Asia despite being outlawed in the United States.
