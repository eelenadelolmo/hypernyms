Texto: 
Bilateral chalazions.  Physical exam reveals extensive inflammatory changes about both eyes with nasal and eye drainage.  The exam is otherwise normal.
Patient has multiple sustem disease and will require sustemic therapy.  She is referred to  Hematology/Oncology for chemotherapy.
CT w/o contrast:
• There are soft tissue masses in the sphenoid bones bilaterally which has caused bone erosion of the interior wall of both orbits, the lateral wall of the right orbit, and the inferolateral portion of the sella turcica. The sella turcica erosion appears to be greater on the left than the right. There is also erosion of the left posterior skull. There is erosion of the medial and lateral walls of the left maxillary sinus. The soft tissue mass has eroded through the skin and caused a lesion over the left cheek that is visible in these images.

CT w/contrast: 
• Same findings as observed in CT without contrast.  In addition there was no intracranial involvement.  No observed fluid collections.  The  ventricles,  sulci,  and  cisterns  are  normal.  There  is no  abnormal  attenuation  in  the  brain  to  suggest  edema  or  hemorrhage.  Gray/white  differentiation  is  preserved.    There  is  no  evidence  of congenital  anomaly.

This is a 2 year old girl with a history of recurrent acute otitis media and chronic serous otitis media for which she has sought medical care from her pediatrician.  She subsequently obtained bilateral tympanostomy tubes at the age of 13 months.  Per records, patient has been seen twice for acute illnesses in her lifetime.  At 5 months of age she presented to an Urgent Care Center with symptoms of nasal congestion and cough.  At one year of age she presented to the emergency department with symptoms of fever and diarrhea.   Patient has never been hospitalized.  She presented at 2 years of age with bilateral chalazions.
This patient clearly has advanced disease with involvement of bone, brain, and skin.  Further studies including a bone scan along with a CT of abdomen, chest, and pelvis demonstrated no peripheral involvement outside of those visualized on head CT.  The classification of this patient's disease would be consistent with "special site involvement" including involvment of sphenoid, orbital, and ethmoid bones along with extension into soft tissue.  Although the prognosis of LCH is extremely variable, this type of disease involvement is not encouraging.  While this patient does not have disseminated disease, there does appear to be multiple organ involvement in the head.  Multiple site/organ involvement has the more variable course as compared to single site or disseminated.  Prognosis for this amount of involvement is listed as 60% expected to have a chronic course of disease, 30% will undergo complete remission, and 10% mortality with treatment.  However due to the nature of involvement being the head prognosis is more grim in this case as those percentiles previously listed are for multiple sites throughout the body involved and not specific to patients with head/sinus/soft tissue involvement.
