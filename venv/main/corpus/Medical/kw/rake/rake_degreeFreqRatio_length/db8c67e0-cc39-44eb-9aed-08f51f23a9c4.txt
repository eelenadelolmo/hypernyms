The pain is constant but worsened when laying flat and alleviated by standing up, sitting down or leaning forward.  She describes the chest pain as a heavy pressure feeling which radiates throughout her right abdomen.  Because of the quality of the pain she initially thought pain was due to gas and attempted Ibuprofen and various and gas agents for pain control without relief.  She reports chills during episodes of extreme pain but denies any fever, night sweats, change in weight or change in appetite.  Her only travel history includes a three hour train ride each way 3 weeks before presenting.  She is currently using Nuva ring for contraceptive prevention which she began about two months ago.   She is G6P2A4, and reports h/o spontaneous abortion within the first trimester of four pregnancies.  She has had two live vaginal births with no complications to mother, her first pregnancy was complicated umbilical cord wrapped around the neck.

This patient has numerous risk factors for PE.  She has a history of 4 spontaneous first trimester abortions.  She presents with unilateral chest pain that is sometimes positional, recent train ride, and lupus-like symptoms.  Dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain are found in 73 and 44 percent of those with PEs per PIOPED II study.  

CXR is not typically diagnostic because atelectasis and effusion are present in those without PEs as well.  

Gold standard is pulmonary angiography, but V/Q scan and CT remain more common today.  CT scan may show alternative diagnosis in 57% (PIOPED), but a clearly visible occlusion is present.

Patient is currently undergoing workup for hypercoagulable state.
