The image findings with retroodontoid pseudotumor vary based on the underlying disease process, but should all have common elements.  Namely, this is an extradural lesion based around the atlantoaxial joint or its associated ligaments.  Therefore, smooth mass effect typically extending posterior from the joint impressing upon the thecal sac and potentially the spine or brainstem is identified.  More specific imaging features are related to the underlying pathologic process.

Post traumatic changes
62 year old male who sustained a fall complaining of head and neck pain.
This case nicely shows the CT and MR features of the retrodontoid mass smoothly impressing upon the thecal sac and cord.  Unfortunately, the exact cause is not known as the patient received his care at a different facility.  He did, however, deny any known systemic diseases upon direct questioning, to include CPPD, RA, gout, or any other reactive or inflammatory arthropathy.  Therefore, it is surmised that these findings likely represent long term repetitive microtrauma.   However, evaluation for gout and CPPD was recommended.
