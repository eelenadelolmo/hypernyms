The site of hemorrhage (an aneurysm) was occluded using an intravascular coil (see post-treatment images).
Non-contrast head CT images show wispy hyperdensity within the sulci in the left frontal/temporal region consistent with acute blood.
Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
These findings on a non-contrast head CT together with the clinical presentation are virtually pathognomonic for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
57 y/o female complaining of severe headache without h/o trauma.
By providing a history that was negative for trauma, there was about a 90% probability that this patient's subarachnoid hemorrhage was caused by aneurysmal rupture. This cause was confirmed by an arterial study and treated using an intravascular coil.
