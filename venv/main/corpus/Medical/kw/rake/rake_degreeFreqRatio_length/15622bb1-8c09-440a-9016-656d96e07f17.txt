Vital signs are normal. Lungs are clear bilaterally and heart demonstrates a regular rate and rhythm. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable.  Laboratory studies including CBC and CMP are within normal limits.
The patient underwent complete surgical resection with greater than 95% of the tumor removed. Adjuvant chemotherapy was also initiated. The patient will be followed clinically and with follow-up MRIs.
• Frontal view of the chest shows a large right paraspinal mass with splaying of the 3rd and 4th posterior ribs.

• Non-contrast CT image of the chest below the carina shows a soft-tissue paraspinal mass with calcification medially. 

• Contrast-enhanced CT image above the carina shows epidural extension.    Ovoid region of enhancement; and, anteriorly is atelectatic lung.

• Pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted MR images show the mass to be of intermediate intensity with heterogeneous enhancement. The mass abuts the trachea and epidural extension is clearly seen. 

• Sagittal T2-weighted MR image shows extension of the mass into the right neural foramina from T2-T4.
Thoracic Neuroblastoma
• Neuroblastoma
• Ganglioneuroblastoma
• Ganglioneuroma
• Neurofibroma
• Schwannoma
• Rhabdomyosarcoma
4-month-old baby boy presents with persistent cough.
Posterior mediastinal masses in children are most commonly neurogenic in origin (30-40%). These lesions are divided into those arising from: sympathetic ganglia (neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroma, ganglioneuroblastoma), peripheral nerves (neurofibroma, Schwannoma), and paraganglion cells (very rare in children). 

A posterior mediastinal mass found in a young child should be considered neuroblastoma until proved otherwise.  This patient presented with only persistent cough despite evidence of intraspinal extension.  This is not unexpected given that about one half of cases are discovered incidentally on chest films.

Classic radiologic findings of thoracic neuroblastoma are demonstrated. These lesions can be mistaken for pneumonia, atelectasis, or prominent thymus. Splaying of the ribs is a clue to the diagnosis of neuroblastoma in this case. 

Plain films are sensitive in suggesting the diagnosis, while MRI is the best modality for evaluating extent of disease. Biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.  Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice.
