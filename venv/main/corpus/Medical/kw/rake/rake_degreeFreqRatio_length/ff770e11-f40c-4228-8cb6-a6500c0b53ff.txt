Asymptomatic with respect to the breasts.
The patient underwent lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy followed by chemotherapy and radiation.
Comparison CC and MLO digital mammograms of the right breast from one year prior show no appretiable abnormality.  Current CC and MLO digital mammograms demonstrate a spiculated mass within the upper half of the breast at the 12:00 position which persisted on compression imaging.  Subsequent ultrasound imaging demonstrated a spiculated hypoechoic shadowing mass at the 1A position which measured 1.3 cm in greatest dimension.  Biopsy of this mass under ultrasound yielded a diagnosis of infiltrating ductal carcinoma.
