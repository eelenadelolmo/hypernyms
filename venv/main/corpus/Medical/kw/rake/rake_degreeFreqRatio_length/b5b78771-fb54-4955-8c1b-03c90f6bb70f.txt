The urologist detorsed the testis with the upper pole remaining mildly dusky but the remainder of the testis returing to normal color.  Both testes underwent orchiopexy.
High resistance waveform in the right testicle represents partial torsion.  A normal low resistance waveform was present on the left (not shown).
Testicular Torsion
If there had truly been increased blood flow on the left, orchitis would be in the differential.
42 y/o male presented to the emergency room with acute onset of right scrotal pain
This case was unique in that the patient presented early, prior to any grey scale changes in the testicular parencyma.  In the image with both testicles side by side, the color doppler gain setting was raised too high in order to show color in the right testicle.  This gives the false appearance of increased flow on the left and normal flow on the right.  Reading this study without patient history, the radiologist could easily misinterpret the color findings as orchitis on the asymptomatic side.  In fact, there was normal flow on the left and decreased flow with high resistance on the right. The key to this study was evaluation of not only the presence of an arterial waveform but recognizing that the flow is high resistance, abnormal for the testis.  Other regions of doppler sampling in the same testis actually demonstrated a reversal of flow during diastole.  A finding seen in venous occlusion.  For the testis, while that may occur with venous invasion by tumor, by far the finding is more common with partial torsion.
