One week post-MVA:

Normal gait, able to stand on heels and toes – balance and coordination intact.

Limited active range of motion:
-	Cervical spine – flexion: 32°/50°; extension: 6°/60°; left rotation: 25°/80°; right rotation: 20°/80°; left lateral bending: 24°/45°; right lateral bending: 12°/45°; reported neck pain radiating into right shoulder on right rotation and neck pain radiating down spine on extension; cervical compression test also produced neck pain radiating to right upper extremity.
-	Shoulder – able to elevate right shoulder up to 90° with pain.
-	Lumbar spine – flexion: 29°/60°; extension: 8°/25°; left lateral bending: 10°/25°; right lateral bending: 10°/25°; all maneuvers produced lumbar pain; pain radiated down left lower extremity on flexion and extension.

Straight leg raise on the left side performed to 26° with lower back pain and left lower extremity pain extending to left foot.

Reflexes: biceps, triceps, patellar and achilles reflexes all intact at 2+/4+

Percussion and posterior-to-anterior compression of the spine produced pain over cervicothoracic and lumbosacral regions paraspinally. Muscle spasm was also noted in these areas as well.

Largest cyst was categorized as Bosniak class II, suggesting a benign lesion. In terms of surgical intervention, no treatment is recommended. No follow-up surveillance is required. However, surveillance may be conducted in 6 to 12 months at the request of the patient or their physician to relieve any associated anxiety about the lesion.

In regards to the patient’s neck, shoulder and back pain, recommended treatment includes chiropractic manipulative therapy. Exercises and electrical muscle stimulation may be beneficial to rehabilitate and strengthen the cervical and lumbar spine region and for core stabilization. Further evaluation of her radicular symptoms by EMG/nerve conduction studies is also recommended.
MRI of cervical spine, right shoulder and lumbar spine was performed to determine the etiology of the patient’s pain. 

MRI of cervical spine revealed left sided disc herniation at levels C4-5 and C5-6 with some associated central stenosis. A small posterior disc herniation at the C3-4 level was also noted.

MRI of right shoulder revealed a tear in the distal supraspinatus tendon. Findings were consistent with a full thickness tear. Degenerative changes in the acromioclavicular joint were also noted. 

MRI of lumbar spine revealed a small left paracentral focal disc protrusion with mild to moderate narrowing of the left neural foramen and slight desiccation of the disc, suggestive of mild anterolisthesis of L4 in relation to L5 with facet arthropathy. Incidentally, a large 5.5 cm renal cyst and second 1.5 cm renal cyst were noted in the lower pole of the left kidney. Smaller cortical renal cysts were also noted in the right kidney.

Incidental renal cysts discovered on lumbar MRI led to follow-up CT imaging. Multiple bilateral renal cysts were confirmed on abdominal and pelvic CT with and without contrast. Results showed two simple cysts in the right kidney—one in the upper pole measuring 8 mm in diameter and one in the lower pole measuring 4 mm in diameter. A large lobulated cyst was noted in the lower pole of the left kidney, extending across the anterior cortex and into the parapelvic region 5.5 cm in diameter. Other than mild lobulation and potential septation, the cyst appeared benign, lacking associated thickening, mural calcification or abnormal postcontrast enhancement. A simple cyst was also noted in the lower cortical pole of the left kidney measuring 1.5 cm in diameter. In addition, bilateral non-obstructing renal calculi and a simple hepatic cyst were also incidentally seen.
Simple vs. Complex Renal Cysts
DDx for incidental kidney lesions:

Cystic: simple; complex; multiple
Malignant Masses: renal cell carcinoma; lymphomas; sarcomas; metastases 
Benign Masses: renal adenomas; angiomyolipomas; oncocytomas
Inflammatory: infection; infarction; trauma (hematoma)

DDx for lower back pain:

The patient’s lower back pain could be a result of trauma from the MVA exclusively (i.e. due to resultant disc protrusion, neural foramen narrowing, etc. seen on MRI). However, with the incidental finding of multiple, bilateral renal cysts, one cannot ignore the possibility that intrarenal or perirenal soft tissue changes could be contributing to her back pain. Tissue distention secondary to the slow-growing cysts may have been exacerbated by trauma during the MVA and could now be contributing to her lumbar pain.
A 55 year old woman was involved in a multiple-car motor vehicle accident. She was sitting in the front passenger seat with her seat belt buckled when another car ran a stop sign and struck her vehicle on the driver’s side. On impact, she was thrown into the dashboard with an outstretched right hand and, subsequently, her right shoulder struck the passenger side door. Airbags did not deploy. Immediately after the accident, her primary injuries were generalized aches and pains. She did not immediately seek medical attention and an ambulance was not called. 

The following day, she presented to a local emergency department because she was experiencing increased pain and hypomobility in her neck, shoulder and lower back. Following examination and x-ray imaging, she was given a prescription for pain medication and muscle relaxants and was discharged with recommendations to seek follow-up care from her primary physician.

Heavy lifting and overhead reaching aggravates her pain while ibuprofen tends to relieve it.

The patient’s pain was localized to three main areas:
1)	Lateral aspect of right shoulder and across posterior scapula
2)	Cervical spine associated with intermittent numbness, radicular pain into right upper arm and headache
3)	Lumbosacral spine in a paraspinal distribution 

MRI of the lumbar spine was ordered to further investigate her back pain. 

The patient’s past medical history was significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, both of which were being treated pharmacologically. She also suffers from sinus congestion periodically. Otherwise, she denied history of heart disease, diabetes, cancer and kidney disease.

In 1986, Bosniak created a systematic approach to classify cystic renal lesions found on CT. Radiologists place renal cysts into one of five categories based on specific criteria. For instance, structural features such as cyst size, margination, wall thickness, septation, calcification and post-contrast enhancement are evaluated. The first two classes are generally considered benign lesions with Class I representing simple renal cysts and Class II representing a cyst with minor irregularities. Class IIF represents cysts similar to those categorized as class II but with slightly more irregular characteristics and greater than 3 cm in diameter. Cysts labeled class III or IV are considered malignant lesions and are highly associated with renal cell carcinoma. 

The smallest, most benign of the patient’s bilateral renal cysts were categorized as Class I, essentially simple cysts with no malignancy risk. They are characterized as simple because of their thin walls, smooth and regular contour, as well as their lack of septae and calcification. The largest cyst located in the left kidney was graded as Class II, still considered benign. Minor architectural irregularities including mild lobulation and minimal--and questionable--septae qualify this lesion as Class II. The septae is questionable because they do not seem to fully cross and septate the cyst. In addition, some views suggest that the tissue in question is actually normal renal collecting duct parenchyma. As the cyst slowly enlarged over time, it began compressing the surrounding parenchyma, taking the path of least resistance to fill the collecting system and displace the renal vein. Some of the surrounding tissue impeded the path of growth, resulting in the cyst&#39;s lobulated appearance.

We can contrast this woman’s renal cysts with an example of a highly malignant renal cyst. The most important criterion that differentiates malignant cysts (Class III and IV) from benign cysts (Class I, II and IIF) is the presence or absence of enhancement. If cystic tissue is enhancing, it suggests that the lesion is receiving its own blood supply, which is a red flag for malignancy. On post-contrast studies, the normal renal parenchyma enhances (as expected), as does the malignant cystic tissue. Comparison between no contrast and with contrast MRI studies demonstrates the enhancing nature of this Class IV cyst. Additional characteristics of this highly malignant cyst include shaggy, thickened walls with irregular borders and central area of necrosis most visible on post-contrast studies. All of these qualities increased the likelihood that the cyst was malignant and, thus, the lesion was surgically resected. Pathology later confirmed that the cyst was, in fact, a renal cell carcinoma.

Bosniak classification demystifies the clinical challenges that incidental complex renal cysts pose to physicians by stratifying the structural changes seen in these lesions and assigning specific prognostic and management guidelines to each category. The system confers exceptional clinical value, as it arms the primary care physician with critical information regarding not only the architectural qualities of the cyst, but also its malignancy risk. Standardized classification of renal cysts permits effective and efficient communication between radiologist and primary care physician (PCP), eliminating confusion about prognosis, treatment and follow-up recommendations. Specifically, categorization protects patients with benign lesions from receiving unnecessary, aggressive procedures and also ensures that patients with malignant lesions receive appropriate surgical intervention. For these reasons, Bosniak classification should be routinely included in imaging reports. 

In some cases, physical examination and lab findings provide clues suggesting the presence of kidney lesions. For instance, large or multiple cysts may cause kidney enlargement great enough to be palpated on abdominal exam; this was not the case in our patient. Most individuals with acquired renal cysts are asymptomatic, but symptoms may arise including include gross hematuria, flank pain and renal colic. Hypertension is another potential sign of underlying renal dysfunction and may occur secondarily to cystic kidney lesions. This phenomenon has been documented to the greatest extent in hereditary cystic kidney diseases (i.e. ADPKD, ARPKD, etc.). However, Zerem et. al. have shown an association between simple renal cyst size and hypertension. Furthermore, they found that aspiration of simple cysts resulted in reduction of blood pressure. Location and number of cysts did not correlate with blood pressure, however. Disruption of juxtaglomerular (JG) apparatus function may be the mechanism by which cysts cause elevated blood pressure. Should the expanding cyst impinge upon the JG apparatus, increased levels of renin may be released from the JG cells, triggering increased production of angiotensin II and aldosterone. These substances promote reabsorption of sodium and water and excretion of potassium at the nephron, subsequently increasing the individual’s blood pressure. With pharmacological treatment, our patient’s blood pressure is 136/84. Our patient is also slightly hypokalemic (3.4mmol/L). Both of these findings support the notion that hypertension is a secondary manifestation of her renal cysts. 

Other lab data may aid in diagnosis of renal cysts. Depending on their size and location, cysts may cause kidney dysfunction. Therefore, renal function tests (i.e. BUN, serum creatinine, GFR) are useful tools for evaluating any negative effects the cyst may be causing for the patient. Our patient’s renal function tests are all within normal limits. Other useful laboratory tests include urinalysis (check for albumin, blood), 24-hour urine collection (oliguria, creatinine clearance), urine cytology (malignant cells may be present) and CBC with differential (anemia may suggest malignancy). 

Complex renal cysts are more likely to cause noteworthy signs and symptoms compared to simple cysts. However, simple cysts may cause renal dysfunction on rare occasion as well, especially if they are large. Furthermore, physical exam and laboratory findings are relatively nonspecific. Therefore, CT imaging remains the gold standard and is essential for accurate diagnosis and differentiation of simple versus complex renal cysts.
