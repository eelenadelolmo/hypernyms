- Abdominal distention
- Decreased, high-pitched bowel sounds
Patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy where he was found to have an ileocecal intussusception.  Manual reduction was unsuccessful, and ileocecal resection was performed with a large mass identified at the ileocecal valve.  The remainder of the ileum and ascending colon were anastomosed.   Pathology revealed Burkitt’s lymphoma.  He will have a diagnostic bone marrow aspiration/biopsy, whole body CT scan, PET scan, bone scan, and spinal tap further evaluation of lymphoma spread.  He will receive at least 2 rounds of chemotherapy, with possibility of more rounds based on above findings.
• Multiple loops of air filled distended bowel with air-fluid levels.
• Serial upper GI with small bowel follow-through images with progressive distention of distal small bowel, with last image showing barium in proximal cecum.
• Fluoroscopy shows beaked appearance at distal ileum with incomplete distention at the cecum with barium extending into transverse and descending colon.
Intussusception, Burkitt's Lymphoma
• Small Bowel Obstruction
• Viral gastroenteritis
• Appendicitis
• Inflammatory Bowel Disease
• Intussusception
4 year old boy with a 3 week history of intermittent crampy abdominal pain lasting as long as 1 hour, diarrhea, intermittent nausea/non-bilious vomiting, and abdominal distention.  Previous evaluations suspected enteroviral infection, treated with conservative management but without relief of symptoms.
This case is unusual as it was an older child who presented with the clinical picture of obstruction, which ultimately was diagnosed as intussusception secondary to Burkitt's lymphoma.  He was sent home from previous exams with the presumptive diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis and was not worked up for a secondary cause of his abdominal distention.  Intussusception is not thought of as a common etiology of bowel obstruction in this age group, but should always be considered in the differential diagnosis.  Burkitt's lymphoma is an unusual cause of intussusception overall.
