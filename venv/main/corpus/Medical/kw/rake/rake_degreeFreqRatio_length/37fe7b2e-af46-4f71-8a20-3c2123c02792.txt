In lesions suspected fo being DDP, there are two indications for surgical procedures:
1. to treat symptoms associated with the lesion
2. in case of diagnostic uncertainty ie the most probable differential diagnosis from the radiological appearance is a chondromatous tumor such as a chondroblastoma 
 In asymptomatic pts, no treatment is necessary
Round well circumscribed lesion superior lateral aspect of the patella.
Dorsal Defect of the Patella
Three lesions commonly affecting the patella include dorsal defect of the patella, osteochondritis dissecans and chondromalacia patellae. Chondromalacia patellae typically is confined to the cartilaginous portion of the patella and classically affects the ridge between the medial and odd facets of the bone. Osteochondritis dissecans is seen in both sexes usually between the ages of 15 and 20 years. It is typically located in the medial facet of the patella, in the middle to lower portion. The dorsal defect is located in the superolateral aspect of the patella. And is seen in approximately 1% of the population. It may be unilateral or bilateral. Assymptomatic or present with local pain and tenderness. It is "hot" on bone scan; generally regarded as a defect in [atellar ossification and may be related to multipartite patellae.
