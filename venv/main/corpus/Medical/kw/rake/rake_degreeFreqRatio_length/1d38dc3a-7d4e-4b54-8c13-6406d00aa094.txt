Neurologic exam:

Patient is intubated, lethargic, following simple commands intermittently when requested to move R arm, but unable to close or open eyes when requested. Opening eyes spontaneously, also  moving spontaneously four extremities. GCS 11 (E4, V1, M6). 

MOTOR:
Normal tone and bulk. Patient moved R upper limb to command, did not move lower limbs to command, although she was moving spontaneously both L and R foot.
3 beats clonus right ankle.

Pt withdraws to pain in all extremities.
Emergent Hemicraniectomy for decompression and hypertonic saline to decrease edema and treat elevated ICP

Patient should be restarted on anti-coagulation as soon as is safe from nonsurgical standpoint.
INITIAL MRI:
1.  Large right MCA perfusion territory infarct, likely secondary to embolic disease given patient's history of adenocarcinoma and likely hypercoagulable state.

FOLLOW-UP HEAD CT:
1.  Extensive cytotoxic edema in most of the right middle cerebral artery territory, consistent with known ischemic stroke.  No evidence of hemorrhage.
 
2.  New subfalcine herniation with approximately 1 cm of right-to-left midline shift.  New ischemic stroke throughout the right anterior cerebral artery territory, which may be due to vascular compression from the subfalcine herniation.
Brain herniation from subacute cerebral infarction
• Ischemic stroke of right anterior cerebral artery
• Hemorrhagic conversion of large right middle cerebral artery
• Cytotoxic edema causing subfalcine herniation and resultant compression of right ACA
23 y.o. woman who was admitted from an outside hospital after becoming unresponsive for > 1 hour.  She has a PMHx of stage IV NSCLC metastatic to liver & bone, a recent hospitalization for pneumonia, and h/o PE while on anticoagulation s/p IVC filter placement,  Her admission non-contrast head CT was "consistent with large right MCA embolic stroke".  Two days later, she has became less responsive.
Early subacute MCA (middle cerebral artery) cerebral infarction with cytotoxic edema, causing subfalcine herniation and resultant compression of right ACA (anterior cerebral artery) - causing infarction in this second vascular territory.  

However, there is an alternate explanation: extension of clot from MCA into the adjacent ACA origin from the ICA (internal carotid artery).  This is more likely, since the portion of the ACA compressed by subfalcine herniation is distal to the recurrent artery of Heubner - and yet it is involved, as well as the inferior frontal lobe.  Of course, all of this would depend on the particular anatomy of this patient.
