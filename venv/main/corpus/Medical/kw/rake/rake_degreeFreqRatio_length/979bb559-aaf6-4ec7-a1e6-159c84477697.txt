Texto: 
Left ear swelling with blood coming out of his left external auditory canal.  No  'Battle sign' or 'raccoon eyes' by physical exam.
Patient had subsequent serial CTs that demonstrated increased amount of blood within the right temporal lobe.  A CT angiogram of the head and subsequent conventional angiogram demonstrated no aneurysm, stenosis, spasm or filling defects.  A temporal bone CT demonstrated with fracture of the left lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus more clearly.
Noncontrast CT of the head:
Soft tissue swelling over the left mastoid bone with enlargement of this auricle and fluid in the left mastoid air cells were present.  No fracture was demonstrated in the mastoid bone.  

An intraaxial hyperdense focus was present in the right temporal lobe.  A hyperdense air fluid level was present in the sphenoid sinus with cortical discontinuity of the left lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus.
Contrecoup intraparenchymal brain contusion and basilar skull fracture.
N/A
21 year old white male found unconscious at the bottom of the stairs of his apartment, smelling of alcohol.  Patient was brought to the emergency room.
Given the pattern of injury the imaging findings were compatible with a contrecoup injury.  Dedicated imaging of the temporal bones was necessary to exclude a fracture of the petrous portion of the temporal bone and mastoid bone.
