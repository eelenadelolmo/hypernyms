Typical therapy for symptomatic chronic subdural hematomas is surgical evacuation.  The patient was evaluated and treated by Neurosurgery with placement of bifrontal subdural drains.

The patient recovered without serious complications and was discharged 4 days later to be seen in follow-up.
CT Head (initial study ordered by ED): 
1.	Bilateral extraaxial (subdural) fluid collections, R>L, likely representing evolved subdural hemorrhages that are somewhat chronic.
2.	R frontal lobe calcification
Bilateral Subdural Hematomas
traumatic subdural hematoma
spontaneous AVM bleed
37 yo male presents to the ED c/o HA x 2 mos duration.  The HA is located diffusely, throbbing, worse in the AM.  He c/o that he also suffers from nausea and vomiting mainly in the AM.  His HA has not relented since its start and has gradually worsened. Non-positional HA.

He reports having been told it was a migraine HA and had been taking Imitrex and Ibuprofen without improvement. He has recently been taking Fioricet with some initial improvement; however, it is no longer effective.

Denies recalling trauma, vision changes, F/C, neck stiffness, photophobia, and/or recent health changes.  

He has been training with the US military for the past 4 mos.
Subdural hematomas are blood clots that form between the dura and the brain. They are usually caused by the movement of the brain relative to the skull, such as in acceleration-deceleration injuries.  The slow bleeding of venous structures delays the development of clinical signs and symptoms. As a result, the hematoma compresses the underlying brain tissue for prolonged periods and can cause significant tissue ischemia and damage. 
Subdural hematomas are classified according to their time of clinical presentation. Acute subdural hematomas are symptomatic within 24 hours after trauma and typically present with a decreased level of consciousness. Between 50% and 70% of patients may have a lucid interval after injury, followed by declining mental status.
A subacute subdural hematomas is symptomatic between 24 hours and 2 weeks after injury and may appear hypodense or isodense on CT scans. Many patients may complain of a headache, altered mental status, muscle weakness, or frank paralysis.
A chronic subdural hematoma becomes symptomatic 2 weeks or more after trauma and up to 45% of patients will demonstrate unilateral weakness or hemiparesis with 50% reporting an altered level of consciousness.  In fact, some patients are unable to recall their head injury. On CT scan a chronic subdural hematoma may appear isodense or hypodense to brain parenchyma. The treatment of chronic subdural hematomas is controversial. If they become symptomatic, they may require surgical evacuation.
