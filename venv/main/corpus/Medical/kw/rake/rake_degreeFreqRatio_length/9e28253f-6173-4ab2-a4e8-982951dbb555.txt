57 y/o man presented to his primary care provider with the chief complaint of progressive abdominal distension over past few months.
After CT evaluation, the search for a primary tumor was undertaken.  All tumor markers i.e. CEA were negative.  The Gastroenterology service was consulted and their colonoscopy was negative.  However at Endo-Gastro-Duodenoscopy, a gastric mass was identified and biopsied.  The biopsy returned as primary gastric adenocarcinoma.
