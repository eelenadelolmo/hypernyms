Cystic Adventitial Disease
Popliteal artery aneurysm, Baker’s cyst, Ganglion cyst, Cystic Adventitial Disease.
44 y/o male with knee pain.  Rule out meniscal tear.
The combination of MRI and MRA demonstrates the characteristic lowT1/highT2 signal of a cyst while also demonstrating that the cystic elements are surrounding the popliteal artery, not arising from the lumen.  MRA demonstrates extrinisic compression.  Connection to the knee joint is not seen.  Aneurysmal dilatation is absent.  The lack of these findings considered with the described abnormality makes the diagnosis of cystic adventitial disease quite certain.
