Patient was sedated at the time of exam.  She had moist mucus membranes, dried blood on lips, and small lacerations on the lateral aspects of her tongue.  Patient was unable to cooperate with examiner for comprehensive neurological exam as she was sedated.  The remainder of physical exam was entirely within normal limits.

Serum pH was 7.23, Sodium 137, Potassium 4.2, Chloride 
100, Bicarbonate 18.8, BUN 13, Creatinine 0.8, Calcium 9.4.  White blood cell count 12,500 with 80% neutrophils, Hemoglobin 13.2, Hematocrit 39.4, Platelets 269,000.  Serum toxicology was completely negative.  Serum ethanol was 1.2 mg/dl (normal <0.5 mg/dl).  Serum pregnancy test was negative.
Complete surgical resection after therapeutic loading of Fosphenytoin.  Patient followed-up in the Neurology-Oncology clinic and repeat imaging of brain with MR on 5/29/2007, 10/25/2006, 8/19/2005, and 2/18/2005 revealed post-operative changes consistent with gliosis and no evidence of recurrence or new mass.
CT of brain with and without contrast revealed a mass measuring 2 x 3 cm in the medial aspect of the left frontal lobe  Central calcification measuring almost 1 cm in diameter with only a very small faint contrast enhancement.  No hemorrhage identified and no other lesions in brain or calvarium noted.

MR images confirm the mass at the grey-white junction which has little edema and enhances heterogenously.
Oligodendroglioma WHO grade II, path diagnosis.
Astrocytoma, ganglioglioma/gangliocytoma, 
neuroblastoma, or other primitive neuroectodermal tumors.
Patient presented with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures.  Patient had single seizure before arriving, lasting 2 –5 minutes, and then a second seizure in triage area that lasted approximately 4 minutes.  Patient has history of intermittent headaches for almost 2 years, but with marked increase in intensity for the week prior to admission.  Patient is otherwise healthy with no family history of seizure disorders.
This patient had a classic presentation with seizures.
