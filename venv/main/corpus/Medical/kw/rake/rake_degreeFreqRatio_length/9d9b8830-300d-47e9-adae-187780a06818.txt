Gastrin 1416 (nl 0-42)
The patient is scheduled for surgery.
On CT, gastrinomas are hypervascular and average 3-4 cm in diameter.  In over one-half of cases, multiple lesions are present.  Thickened gastric and small bowel folds may be present from increased gastric acid secretion and malabsorption.  Approximately 60% of patients have metastases at the time of diagnosis, most often to the liver and lymph nodes.
Islet cell tumors typically express somatostatin receptors, making them amenable to Octreoscan imaging where they demonstrate abnormally increased uptake of the radiotracer.
gastrinoma
Ductal adenocarcinoma
Islet-cell tumor: insulinoma, gastrinoma, nonfunctioning, glucagonoma, somatostatinoma, VIPoma
Lymphoma

Solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm
Mimics: peripancreatic adenopathy, adrenal mass, splenule
Focal pancreatitis
Idiopathic fibrosing pancreatitis
Pancreaticoblastoma: children
Acinar cell carcinma
85 yo male w/ h/o distant RCC s/p rt nephrectomy now w/ transaminitis.
This was a rather unusual presentation for a gastrinoma in that there were no mets identified by imaging, and the patient had no complaints of elevated gastrin levels.  Unfortunately, the patient had poor kidney function and could not receive IV contrast, limiting the CT imaging.  However, with the positive Octreoscan and dramatically increased serum gastrin level, the pancreatic head mass is consistent with a gastrinoma.
