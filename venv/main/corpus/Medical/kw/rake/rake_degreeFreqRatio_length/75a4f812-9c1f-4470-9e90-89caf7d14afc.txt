Stress Fracture/March Fracture of the third left metatarsal
>> Blurring of the cortical margin is consistent with the presence of a stress fracture.

>> Subsequent radiograph performed about one month later demonstrated periosteal new bone formation over the third metatarsal that is consistent with a healing fracture.
