Texto: 
Focal point tenderness over the dorsum of the left foot over the metatarsals.
>> Cessation of activity

>> Orthopedic flat shoe
>> Blurring of the cortical margin of the 3rd left metatarsal was initially present.

>> Follow-up radiographs revealed periosteal new bone formation within the diaphysis of the 3rd left metatarsal.
Stress Fracture/March Fracture of the third left metatarsal
>> Blurring of the cortical margin is consistent with the presence of a stress fracture.

>> Subsequent radiograph performed about one month later demonstrated periosteal new bone formation over the third metatarsal that is consistent with a healing fracture.
23 year old male with 2 months of progressively increasing left foot pain.
>> This young army recruit had a classic presentation of a march fracture (i.e. metatarsal stress fracture)
