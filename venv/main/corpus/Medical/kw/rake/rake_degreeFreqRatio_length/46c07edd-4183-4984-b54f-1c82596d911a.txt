Exam findings suggestive of an arthritis.
The bones are diffusely osteopenic.  Findings typical of osteoarthritis include distal greater than proximal joint space narrowing, osteophytosis, and sclerosis, with typical degenerative findings at the thumb carpal-metacarpal joint also appreciated.  A small subchondral cyst is present at the distal head of the middle finger proximal phalanx.

Additionally, central erosions are present at the DIP’s (distal interphalangeal joint) of the ring and index fingers, as well as the PIP’s (proximal interphalangeal joint) of the small and middle fingers.  There are subluxations present at the small finger PIP as well as the thumb and index finger MCP’s (metacarpal-phalangeal joint).  The characteristic “gull-wing” appearance of the articular surface is best appreciated at the ring finger DIP.
Erosive Osteoarthritis
• Erosive osteoarthritis
• Psoriatic osteoarthritis
• Rheumatoid arthritis (well, not really ...)
• Reiter's Syndrome (only in men)
• Gout (doesn't look like this)
