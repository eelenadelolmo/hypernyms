Surgical storage of craniotomy fragment pending definitive management
ACA ischemia

-	Surgical
-	Heterotopic ossification

GSW from global war on terrorism.  Evacuated to CONUS  for definitive management after stabilization in Germany.
The ACA territory infarcts may be the result of subfalcial herniation causing compression of the artery against the free margin of the falx.  The herniation could have occurred from the bullet shock-wave and/or subsequent brain swelling.
