Tumor was initially treated on daily carboplatin and weekly vincristine with craniospinal irradiation. Subsequent decrease in the size of lesion occurred then re-resection. Patient then received stereotactic radiotherapy. Ultimately, patient underwent high-dose chemotherapy with Cytoxan and melphalan with autologous stem cell rescue.
There is a large heterogeneous mass in the pineal region causing severe hydrocephalus of the lateral and third ventricles.

The lobular mass is iso - to hypointense on T1-weighted imaging and iso- to hypointense on T2 weighted
imaging with intense enhancement of most of the mass.
Medulloepithelioma
Pineoblastoma
Non germinomatous germ cell tumor
PNET
Presents with headache and vomiting
Pt is alive 2 years from time of presentation/resection.  There is a stable cranial nerve III palsy bilaterally and cognitive difficulties
