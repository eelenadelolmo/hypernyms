Patient was unresponsive, and on mechanical ventilation.  His pupils were fixed and dilated.
Patient was removed from life support shortly after the CT images were obtained.
Axial CT images through the brain demonstrate homogeneously decreased attenuation. There is effacement of the sulci and basilar subarachnoid spaces with loss of the grey-white matter differentiation. Multiple focal areas of more severely decreased attenuation are present, particularly within the basal ganglia and watershed areas - consistent with evolving infarct.
Anoxic Brain Injury, anoxia
Anoxic brain injury with cerebral edema and multiple infarcts.  No differential diagnosis is required given clinical history.
12-year old boy with multiple medical problems was having his  tracheostomy tube changed at home.  His caregivers were unable to replace the tube expeditiously and the patient was without oxygen for approximately 20 minutes suffering  a cardiopulmonary arrest.
Diffuse cerebral edema is seen in 10-20% of severe brain injuries.  It may be secondary to primary injury or as the result of hypoxia.  It may also be seen in a variety of other settings which include strangulation, suffocation, and post-traumatic apnea.  It is twice as common in children compared with adults.  The classic image findings usually takes 24-48 hours to develop after the inciting event.  The edema is due to increased intravascular blood and/or brain water content.  The cerebellum may appear relatively hyperdense.  This patient suffered from prolonged anoxia secondary to a problem during tracheostomy tube change.  The CT of the brain was obtained 24 hours after the event.
