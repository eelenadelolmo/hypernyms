Figure 1. Axial image from a contrast enhanced CT scan shows a heterogenous solid mass within the right kidney.

Figure 2.  Nephrectomy specimen demonstrates a well-circumscribed mass in the upper pole of the kidney.

Figure 3.  Histological examination of the mass demonstrates cuboidal cellls intermixed with foam cells in a papillary configuration.
