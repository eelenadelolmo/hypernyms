Obturator Hernia
None
45 year old female with Marfan's Disease.  She presents with a one-hour duration of a painful right inguinal region, which she states is a very similar pain as to when she had a dissection of her left femoral artery.
This study was with intravenous contrast only, as the diagnosis of exclusion was a femoral artery and aortic dissection, given the patient's medical history.
