Lhermitte’s sign (Barber chair phenomenon – electric shock down the spine into the limbs with neck flex/ext)
Focal, well-defined enhancing lesion in the posterior aspect of the cord at C2-C3, which replaces rather than displaces cord tissue.  Increased T2 signal within and thickening of the spinal cord from C1 to C5, consistent with surrounding edema. No involvement of adjacent bone or dura.
Cervical Cord hemangioblastoma
• AVM
• Cavernous malformation
• Ependymoma
• Astrocytoma
• Hemangioblastoma
• Metastatic vascular tumor (in particular RCC)
• extramedullary/intradural tumor.
