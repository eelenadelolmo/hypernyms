Texto: 
Physical exam showed an irritated cervical os, and Pap smear results returned High-grade SIL.  
Patient was then referred to OB/GYN.
Patient returned to IR 4 weks later for removal of NUS and placement of antegrade ureteral stent. From this point on, the stent can be exchanged through the bladder by Urology service.
Normal pelvic ultrasound.

PET/CT - right hydronephrosis with abnormal pelvic uptake in region of uterus. No pathologic up-take seen in region of local lymph nodes.

Fluoroscopic images obtained during a right percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement showed right sided hydronephrosis and high-grade stricture of distal right ureter.  Stricture was dilated using balloon angioplasty technique, and a nephroureteral stent (NUS) was placed.
Cervical Cancer - Stage IIIB with ureteral obstruction
Transitional cell carcinoma.
Endometrial carcinoma.
Drop Metastasis
Patient is a 42 y/o G5 P4014 woman who had not had cervical cancer screening for several years. Patient developed right sided pelvic pain and presented to a local Emergency Department, where she was initially felt to have an enlarged uterus and symptomatic fibroids.  
She was referred to a local primary care physician for a Pap Smear.
In the management of cervical cancer, surgical candidacy is in part based on an assessment of parametrial tumor extension by physical examination. 
Radical hysterectomy is usually reserved for medically-fit patients with tumor confined to the cervix (stage I) or with minimal extension to the proximal vagina (stage IIA). Radiation therapy is the treatment of choice for tumor that has spread to the parametria or beyond (stage IIB or greater). Several previous studies have demonstrated that computed tomography has a disappointing accuracy (of only approximately 50%) in evaluating parametrial extension of cervix cancer. CT alone usually cannot accurately differentiate stage lB from IIB lesions and thus usually does not play a significant role in deciding surgical vs. nonsurgical treatment. In this particular case, the right sided hydronephrosis makes parametrial extension more obvious.  The PET scan findings further help with staging and management in this patient.
