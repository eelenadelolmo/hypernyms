Normal ligamentous, meniscal and ROM knee testing.
No labs drawn.
None except reassurance. Surgical excision not advised unless pain increases or interferes with ADL.
Non-aggressive appearing postero-medial and proximal right fibular exostosis (extending from the metaphysis, directed away from the joint and demonstrating cortical and medullary continuity). No periosteal reaction, no cortical abnormality or soft tissue mass.
Osteochondroma of right fibula
Osteochondroma
Sarcomatomous degeneration (Chondrosarcoma).
right knee pain for several months without known trauma.
While long bones of the appendicular skeleton represent one of the most common sites for osteochondromas, this location is a little unusual.
