28 year old man presented in September, 20xx with acute onset of right sided hemiplegia.
MRI done in September, in Haifa, revealed a large complex mass in the left frontal lobe.  The mass was biopsied, and initially interpreted as a tumor.

Follow up MRI in October, resulted in reassessment of the original biopsy diagnosis.

January of the following year, MRI demonstrates regression of lesion in left frontal lobe with a new mass in the right frontal lobe.  

This case was provided courtesy of Dr. Azaria Simonovich, neuroradiologist at Rambam Hospital, in Haifa, Israel.
