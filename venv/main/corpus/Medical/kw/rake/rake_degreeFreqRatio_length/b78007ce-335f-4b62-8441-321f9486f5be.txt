Texto: 
Swelling of the entire right upper extremity to the fingers, with diffuse severe pain, erythema of forearm and mottled erythema of the hand.  No induration or calor. No laboratory findings to suggest infection.
Patient's pain persisted over 6 month period despite aggressive physical and occupational therapy, narcotics, and unsuccessful nerve blocks.  Despite treatment, this patient's pain became diffusely disseminated to involve bilateral lower extremities as well as the distal left hand.  She is being currently under consideration for lumbar cord stimulation trial versus intravenous lidocaine infusion trial and may ultimately require an intrathecal infusion pump.
March 2007:
Diffusely increased right upper extremity periarticular uptake of Tc99m MDP.

September 2007:  
Improved but persistent right upper extremity periarticular uptake.
Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy
Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy
37 year old female with new onset right upper extremity swelling status post rotator cuff surgery (arthroscopic capsulorrhaphy) January 2007.
When findings consistent with RSD are positive on bone scan, this usually reflects a favorable treatment prognosis. The cause of CRPS is unknown, and there is no cure. It can get worse over time, and may spread to other parts of the body. Occasionally it goes away, either temporarily or for good. Treatment typically focuses on relieving the pain, and can include medicines, physical therapy and nerve blocks.
