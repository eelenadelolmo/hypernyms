Giant cysterna magna
2 year old female with VP shunt and fever of unknown origin.
The enlarged posterior fossa cyst can cause obstruction in these patients requiring the placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, as was performed in this patient. Heterotopias and callosal dysgenisis occur in about 20% of cases.
