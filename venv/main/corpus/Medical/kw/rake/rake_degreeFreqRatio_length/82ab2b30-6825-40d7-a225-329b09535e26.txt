Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the knee shows a large
lytic lesion  of the meta-eiphiphysis of the left distal femur extending into  the lateral epicondyle. The tumor appears to be confined within the bone on the radiograph. The lesion appears  to have well defined, smooth border and is consistent with a slowly growing tumor. 


CT scan in bone windows of the left knee shows an osteolytic, well demarcated mass but with disruption of the cortex posteriorly breakthrough of the cortical bone by the lesion on images 16, 17, and 22.
Giant cell tumor of the bone (Osteoclastoma)
34-year-old Caucasian male who, for six months, had left knee pain that had become progressively worse. The patient has no history of trauma to the knee.
Patient's with giant cell tumor most frequently present with pain  folowed by local swelling and limited joint motion.  In 10 percent of patients  patients may have sudden onset or increased pain and swelling at presentation due to a pathlogic fracture. The knee  is the most common site of involvement . These tumors  are usually located in the meta-epiphysis of the long bones, most common found in around the knee joint. Sixty to seventy percent occur in the third and fourth decades slightly more prevalent in females. 

Radiographs  characteristically show an osteolytic tumor that extends to subchondral bone with cortical thinning and expansion.  The margin of the tumor may he well or poorly defined. Although the lesion is epimetaphyseal in location, it may extend into the diaphysis.  Extension through the cortex into the soft tissues is sene in 20-50% of patients. Microscopically, the striking feature is the presence of numerous scattered osteoclast-like giant cells. These are found within a background of plump or spindled fibroblast like cells.  Some of these tumors will metastasize early, but the majority are not initially aggressive. The usual treatment, when the tumor has not invaded the joint space nor disrupted the cortex, is  curettage with cement packing. Others are treated with block resection or occasionally with amputation. There is unfortunately a high incidence of recurrence of these tumors, and sometimes the tumor is more aggressive and may even metastasize.
