Manipulation of the right hip made the patient very uncomfortable.
Patient was seen by a university orthopedic surgeon and the lesion was resected and confirmed as an ABC.
Frontal radiograph (fig. 1) shows an expansile, lytic lesion of the distal femoral metaphysis (medullary eccentric) with narrow zone of transition, fine septae and dramatic cortical thinning.  No periosteal reaction noted.

Pre and postcontrast corornal T1w MR images (fig. 2) reveals an enhancing mass without adjacent soft tissue invasion.
Additional T2w MR image (fig. 3) shows hyperintense (presumed fluid) components with fluid-fluid levels.
Aneurysmal Bone Cyst
Aneurysmal bone cyst
Telangiectatic osteosarcoma
Solitary bone cyst
Eosinophilic granuloma
3 year old body presenting with a limp (pain appears to involve the right leg).
This is a fairly dramatic example of expansion resulting in cortical thinning.
