This is a normal variation.   Successful pregnancy with a uterus didelphys is approximately 60%. However,  women with the condition are at high risk of premature labor and spontaneous abortion due to an incompetent cervix.  It may require followup if the patient becomes pregnant for possible cerclage.
Transvaginal ultrasound images demonstrate two separate uteri in the transverse plane.
Didelphic Uterus
Didelphis uterus.  There are milder congenital variations of the uterus such as subseptal and septal uterus where the uterine cavity separation is only superior.  During the examination, a complete duplication is excluded by excluding the presence of 2 vaginas.  Finally, if one can visualize the cervix,  variations of this can differentiated-- uterus bicornis unicollis (1 cervix) from uterus bicornis bicollis (2 cervices).  This is generally evident on pelvic exam.
The patient is a 49 year old female who presents with abnormal uterine bleeding.
