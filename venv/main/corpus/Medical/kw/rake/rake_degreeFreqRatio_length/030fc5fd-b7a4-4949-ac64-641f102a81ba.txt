Surgical resection.
Sagital T1W pre-gad images demonstrates a well circumscribed, isointense, extra-axial cerebellopontine angle mass.
Coronal T2W image again shows the mass to be slightly increased in signal in comparison to the surrounding brain tissue.
Axial T1W post-gad image demonstrate a homogenously enhancing mass.
