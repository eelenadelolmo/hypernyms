Low back stiffness.
The disease should be discussed in detail with the patient.  Treatment includes a regular exercise regimen to maintain mobility.  NSAIDs can be used to help with pain and mobility.  Extensive pain or disability due to spine or hip involvement may require surgery.

Ankylosis of the facet joints of the spine. Bridging syndesmophytes are seen at all levels. There is squaring of the vertebral bodies with increased density at the corners. There has been ankylosis of the sacroiliac joints bilaterally. The paravertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.
