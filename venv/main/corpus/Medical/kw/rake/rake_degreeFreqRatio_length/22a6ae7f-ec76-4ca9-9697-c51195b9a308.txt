Aside from a small scalp laceration he had no physical findings.  Patient was initially unresponsive but regained consciousness in the Emergency Room.  ER physician noted that some of his responses to questions did not seem appropriate.  However, there were no focal neurological deficits.
Patient was a civilian visiting for a conference at Walter Reed.  As he was not eligible for non-emergent care, he was transferred to another facility following stabilization in the Emergency Room.
Hyperdense acute blood within multiple CSF-containing spaces including the fourth ventricle, pre-pontine cistern, intrapenduncular cistern, suprasellar cister, left Sylvian fissure, left interhemispheric space and left middle cerebral artery fissure.
Nontraumatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
Ischemic Stroke
Subdural Hematoma
Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
58 year old man found down while attending conference at Walter Reed.
While severe headache is discussed as the most significant predictor of subarachnoid bleed, more often patients will experience a loss of consciousness as the presenting symptom as did this patient.
