Clinical examination reveals loss of body hair and impaired vision.
The patient is referred for endocrinology and neurosurgery consultation.
MR imaging of the pituitary gland demonstrates the presence of a intrasellar mass, measuring 25 x 15 x 19 mm , with supradiaphragmatic extension expanding the sella turcica . The mass is  heterogeneous on both T1-weighted and T2 weighted images, displaying a peripheral mild T1 hyperintense and T2 hypointense border and central areas of cystic degeneration or necrosis. Following contrast administration , the sellar mass enhances strongly in the peripheral portions of the cystic spaces. The mass is not clearly separate from the pituitary gland. The pituitary stalk is thickened and vividly enhancing. The sellar mass exerts mild mass effect on the optic shiasm. There is no edema along optic chiasm on T2-weighted images. The normal posterior pituitary bright spot is not seen in the expected location (correlation with the macroadenoma and the hydration status of the patient). There is no ectopic posterior pituitary gland. Meckelâ€™s caves, cavernous sinuses and visible portion of internal carotid arteries are within normal limits.   The constellation of clinical, laboratory and MR imaging findings are in keeping with hemorrhagic pituitary macroadenoma.

A 30-year old woman is referred for MRI evaluation of the pituitary gland due to subacute onset of headache and impaired vision and symptoms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism,  such as cessation of menstruation, low libido and infertility. There is no alteration in the level of consiousness.
A differential diagnosis problem in this case would be pituitary apoplexy. The subacute clinical syndrome of the patient favors against the diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy and is more suggestive of an hemorrhagic macroadenoma. From a radiological standpoint , the presence of central necrotic areas within a peripherally enhancing pituitary mass are seen in both pituitary apoplexy and hemorrhagic macroadenoma.
