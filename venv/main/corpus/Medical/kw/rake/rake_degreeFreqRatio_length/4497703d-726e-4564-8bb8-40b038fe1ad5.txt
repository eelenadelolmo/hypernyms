Surgery and seizure watch dog in the near future.
Continue medications (as above)
Continue ketogenic diet and use of VNS
MRI T2 axial and coronal showing multiple cortical lesions - high signal and mixed signal intensities.
MRI T1 axial showing subependymal calcifications/nodules in the lateral ventricles.
FDG shows abnormal cerebral glucose metabolism is evident where there are multiple areas of hypometabolism in the regions of the cortical tubers.  
AMT PET scan: The region adjacent to tuber #7 in the left frontal cortex shown in planes 13, 14, and 15 has increased AMT uptake.
Tuberous sclerosis
• Migration disorder
• Subependymal gray matter heterotopia
• Multiple Gliomas
• Cortical tubers
14 y/o girl with history of intractable complex partial seizures beginning at 5 months of age. Otherwise in good general health requiring no hospitalizations or surgeries.  She uses a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) which is set at a maximum level and is maintained on a ketogenic diet which have helped to control seizure activity.  

She has no recent history of cardiac, renal, or pulmonary difficulties.  Current medications include: Jolivette tablet (progesterone), Keppra, Mysoline, Lamictal, Clonazepam, Diazepam, and Diastat.
This 14y/o female has had intractable partial seizures that began at 5 mos of age.  The patient is on a significant number of medications as listed above.  TS is noted to involve many organ systems, however only neoplasms of the brain were found.  These neoplasms included: cortical tubers and subependymal nodules 
In the evaluation of epilepsy, MEG(magnetoencephalography) was used in conjunction with MRI to localize the source of the seizures.  This is important because surgery is being considered in the near future.
A video EEG was also performed and the results are as follows:
Abnormal due to presence of: 1) several tonic seizures, asymmetrical, with eye and head deviation to the right and tonic posturing of the right upper extremity accompanied with generalized EEG changes; 2) right-sided eye blinking accompanied with right-sided predominant rhythmic EEG activity during sleep; 3) bilateral eye blinking accompanied with generalized spike wave discharges out of sleep; 4) diffuse background slowing; and 5) lack of an organized sleep architecture.
Her seizures seemed to be refractory to medical treatment, and thus a ketogenic diet and vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) were employed and both have proven to suppress seizure activity.
