Patient has normal gait for age, but with increased cervical lordosis and rigidity in his neck.  He is also having difficulty lifting his neck off of his chest upon rising to a standing position.  The patient is playful, actively walking without apparent distress other than his abnormal posture.
Microbial confirmation by biopsy was deemed an inappropriate risk and the patient was subsequently treated empircally with an additional 6 weeks of IV piperacillin/Tazobactam followed by 6 weeks of Amoxycillin/Clavulanic Acid.  A c-collar was placed with additional thoracic back support to help stabilize the spine during recovery.  He appears to be doing well at follow up 11 months later.  There are no signs of active infection.  However, chronic signs of past osteomyelitis remain and are seen in fusion of the vertebral bodies T1-T3, Gait is unaffected while cervical neck motility is impeded.
• Early x-rays show the battery from an AP and lateral view.
• A later x-ray reveals a widened mediastinum with a ring shaped formation of abscess consistent with mediastinitis. 
• Flouro studies show a constricted esophagous with suspected uleration of the posterior middle esophagus. 
• A later MRI shows infectious degeneration of several thoracic vertebral bodies.
• An x-ray done 11 months later shows fusion of the vertebral bodies T1-T3.

16 month old baby boy presenting with reports of difficulty walking and apparent pain with raising his arms.  Several weeks ago, this patient was admitted to the hospital following removal of a small watch battery from his esophagus which lead to esophageal rupture and mediastinitis.  Presenting symptoms prompting removal of the battery several weeks ago included a 5 day history of difficulty with ingestion, fever, vomiting, and 3 days of runny nose and cough.  He was given 2 weeks of IV antibiotics (Ampicillin and Sulbactam) and was afebrile at discharge four weeks ago.
Unfortunately, this patient developed recurrent seeding and infection despite adequate standard of care and prophylaxis for suspected mediastinitis using multi-agent antibiotic treatment.  Adequate follow up is imperative to ensure full resolution of infection following mediastinitis.  This patient presented to an outside facility several weeks following the apparent eradication of his mediastinitis.  Upon presentation, he was evaluated and given the diagnosis of an upper respiratory viral infection and discharged.  This diagnosis may have been reasonable at the time, however, it is imperative at the time of diagnosis to raise parental awareness concerning the expected duration of the supposed viral illness including any signs of progressing illness.  It was several weeks before the patient presented again with complaints unresolved fever coupled with a new onset of difficulty walking and raising his arms at which point osteomyelitis was diagnosed.
