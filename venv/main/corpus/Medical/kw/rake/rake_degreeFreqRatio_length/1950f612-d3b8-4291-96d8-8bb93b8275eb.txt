Texto: 
Treatment of ganglion cysts include aspiration with injection of steroid.  Surgical treatment is total ganglionectomy.  Recurrence is most common complication (30-60% nonoperative, 5-15% operative).
Multiplanar, multisequence MRI imaging of the left wrist with and without gadolinium demonstrate a well defined, lobulated mass arising from the volar surface of the wrist at the radial carpal joint.  The mass is homogenious with high T2 and low T1 signal intensity.  On post-gadolinium images there is smooth peripheral enhancement.
