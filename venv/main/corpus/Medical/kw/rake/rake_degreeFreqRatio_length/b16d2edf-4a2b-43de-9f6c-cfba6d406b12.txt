Snuffbox tenderness noted, as well as pain with volar flexion.
Patient to be seen by orthopedics.
The oblique radiograph demonstrates a faint lucency in the distal pole of the scaphoid.  The MRI images demonstrate a clear fracture of the distal scaphoid, with fragmentation and some ulnar displacement.  The waist and proximal pole of the scaphoid are within normal limits.
