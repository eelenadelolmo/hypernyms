Texto: 
Most often a normal physical exam with the possibility of developing bibasilar, fine end-inspiratory crackles and clubbing.  Cor pulmonale may result in advanced disease.  PFTs are consistent with a restrictive pattern with reduced total lung capacity, decreased DLCO and decreased compliance.  Laboratory values are often non-specific.
There is not a specific treatment for asbestos related pleural plaque findings.  Similarly, those patients progressing to asbestosis (interstitial pulmonary fibrosis) lack a specific treatment and management should focus on preventing further damage.  These measures include smoking cessation, prevention of further asbestos exposure and radiographic monitoring for progression and associated malignancies.  Additionally, asbestosis patients should receive the pneumococcal and influenza vaccines and receive prompt treatment for respiratory infections.
Airway wall thickening with bilateral pleural plaques seen in the lateral aspects of both lung fields on AP view.  No interstitial disease is noted.
Pleural Plaques
Asbestos related pleural plaques.
Annual chest x-ray for follow-up of questionable asbestos exposure while working as an auto mechanic changing brakes on vehicles for 10 years.  Pt also with 50 pack year smoking history.
