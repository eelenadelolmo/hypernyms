Tc-99m MDP bone scan demonstrates diffusely increased uptake in the axial skeleton as well as parts of the appendicular skeleton.  The kidneys and soft tissue activity are not visualized.  These findings are consistent with a superscan, secondary to diffuse osteoblastic metastatic disease in a patient with known prostate cancer.
