Physical examination revealed mild cyanosis and mild tachypnea. A newborn laboratory panel was normal.
At one week of age, the patient underwent balloon dilatation of his right ventricular outflow tract, which resulted in good antegrade flow. Per his mother, he has been asymptomatic since the procedure, with no further episodes of diophoresis, cyanosis, or increased work of breathing. On a follow-up clinic visit, his room air oxygen saturation was 80%, suggesting some narrowing of his aortopulmonary collaterals. This will be followed closely, as continued closure may require early elective repair.
The main pulmonary artery shadow is absent and there is upturning of the cardiac apex, both of which contribute to a "boot-shaped" cardiomediastinal silhouette. The pulmonary vasculature is normal to slightly decreased.
Tetralogy of Fallot
1. Tetralogy of Fallot.
2. Normal neonatal chest radiograph with prominent thymus.
Newborn term infant delivered by cesarean section with oxygen requirement at one hour of life. Apgars were 8 and 8. Prenatal course was unremarkable.
The diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot was suggested by the clinical history and radiographic findings, which included absence of a normal pulmonary artery shadow and an upturned cardiac apex. This latter finding is due to right ventricular hypertrophy, one of the cardinal abnormalities of this condition. The remaining components of the tetralogy include obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract, a ventricular septal defect, and an aorta that overrides the interventricular septum.

Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic congenital heart abnormality in infants and children. Findings on plain film radiographs include a boot-shaped cardiac silhouette (“coeur en sabot”), a small or concave pulmonary artery, and occasionally, a right aortic arch.
