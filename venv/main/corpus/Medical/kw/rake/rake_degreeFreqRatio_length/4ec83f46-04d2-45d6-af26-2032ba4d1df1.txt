Choroid Plexus Cyst
None
28 y/o Caucasian female presented for routine 20-week gestational ultrasound.
The detection of a choroid plexus cyst should prompt the radiologist and sonographer to embark on a detailed search for other anomalies that increase the risk of trisomies being present.  These would include: Structural abnormalities, thickened nuchal fold, short femur or humerus, pyelectasia, and echogenic bowel.
