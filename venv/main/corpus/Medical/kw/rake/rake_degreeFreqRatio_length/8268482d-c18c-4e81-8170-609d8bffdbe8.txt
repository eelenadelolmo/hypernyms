Texto: 
Normal appearing, normal cardiac exam, normal VS
Thyroid with 3 cm palpable, freely mobile mass inferior to the right thyroid lobe.
Labs
Pre-CT:  TSH 0.24 (nml >0.35)
Post-CT: TSH 0.003
Endocrine and surgery consults pending
FNA will likely be followed by surgery regardless of histology
Heterogenously enhancing, large mass contiguous with the inferior margin of the right thyroid lobe.  No lymphadenopathy or other masses.
Mildly heterogeneous and hypoenhancing mass/nodule corresponding to CT, with otherwise normal thyroid uptake on I-123 scan
Solitary thyroid nodule
Intermediate nodule, likely benign.
Since it is not "hot", it will be treated as a cold nodule and the patient is sent for FNA.
31 yo female presents for CT following deviated trachea noted on routine CXR. 
Following CT, she develops increased jitteriness, palpitations, intermittent hot sensation.  
Ultimately sent for Nuclear medicine I-123 scan for further evaluation of Thyroid.
Decrease in TSH following CT is the Jod-Basedow effect, the nodule converts the iodine from the contrast load into thyroid hormone, thus further suppressing her marginally low TSH pre-CT
