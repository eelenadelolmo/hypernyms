This patient is being evaluated for surgery, as her pelvic pain is referable to the site of the pelvis splenic tissue.
The pelvic ultrasound demonstrates a isoechoic solid mass in the left adnexal region.  The CT exam shows an ill-defined enhancing mass in the left adnexa.  There is also a focal enhancing mass anterior to the liver.  The sulfur-colloid nuclear medicine study shows focal uptake in the left adnexa, corresponding to the CT and ultrasound findings, indicative of splenic tissue.  There is also a focus of activity anterior to the liver, indicating more ectopic splenic tissue.  Incidentally, there were other splenic deposits in the peritoneal cavity as well (not shown).
