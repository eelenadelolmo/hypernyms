None needed. Follow up sonography 18-20 weeks for fetal anatomical survey if indicated clinically.
Single Ultraound image shows thin curvilinear echogenic line within the posterior gestational sac. No evidence or traversing fetal parts on real time examination.

Amniotic Band
26 year old female, carrying known intrauterine pregnancy, 14 weeks gestational age.
The chorion is the outer membrane of the gestational sac and the amnion in the inner membrane. The amniotic cavity or inner cavity contains the developing embryo/fetus. Early in pregnancy, in the first trimester, the amnion and the chorion are not fused. Fusion occurs by 15-16 weeks at which time the chorionic or outer cavity of the gestational sac is obliterated. The normal amnion is approximately < 1 mm in thickness. A normal unfused section of amnion should not encircle a limb or other part of the fetus but should be clearly separate from the fetus. 

The importance of understanding the timeline of amniotic fusion is in not misinterpretating the normal unfused amniotic membrane with a pathologic intrauterine anomaly such as an amniotic band.
