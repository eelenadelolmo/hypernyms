Texto: 
On presentation the patient had a fever of 38.6?C.
Patient was fussy but consolable.
UA was positive for a UTI.
Urine culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The patient had an US that showed left ureteral duplication with vesicoureteral reflux and dilatation of the left upper pole ureter that inserts directly into the urethra. It also shows reflux into a non-dilated right ureter. Renal DMSA scan showed a 52% contribution by the right ureter versus 36% contribution by the left lower pole ureter and 12% by the left upper pole ureter.

The patient was started on antibiotic treatment. Due to ectopic left upper pole ureter and poor function of the upper pole, the patient was referred to the urologist for possible left heminephrectomy with partial ureterectomy at the age 3-6 months of age.
VCUG shows reflux of urine into a left ureter and upper pole renal pelvis with severe hydronephrosis and twisting of the ureter suggesting a grade 5 vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) on the left. This ureter is inserting directly into the urethra.

On the right, reflux of urine into the right ureter and renal pelvis without hydronephrosis - suggesting a grade2 VUR on the right.
Vesicoureteral Reflux Secondary to Ectopic Ureter
• Primary VUR
• Cystitis
• Ectopic Ureter 
• Ureterocele
