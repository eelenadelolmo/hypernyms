Texto: 
Head:  cloudy nasal discharge
Lungs: scattered rhonchi, no crackles, no wheezing
Lymph: No cervical lymphadenopathy

LABS: 
PPD negative
Histoplasma negative
ESR â€“ 12
WBC 9.3 (w/ NL distribution)
No further work up is necessary.  It is important for the mother to convey these findings to future physicians when a chest xray or CT is performed and to relay the current dimensions.
There is a left upper lobe pulmonary nodule which measures approximately 1.1 cm in diameter. There is central calcification within this lesion, which has become slightly more dense over the year in between CT.  The borders are well demarcated.

Pulmonary metastatic disease 
Primary pulmonary malignancy
10 y.o. girl with "chronic congestion" presented to clinic with new onset of cough and sore throat.  The patient also had complained of 6 months of intermittent headaches.  The patient denied any sputum production or fevers.
There are many algorithms for the evaluation of the "solitary pulmonary nodule".  In a young child, metastatic disease is very uncommon - and thus this girl was followed with repeat imaging that documented a stable lesion size - now, most likely a healed granuloma.
