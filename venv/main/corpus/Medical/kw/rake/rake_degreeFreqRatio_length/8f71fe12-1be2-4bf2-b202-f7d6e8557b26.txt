Muscle weakness in right upper and lower extremities
Acute stroke protocol
There is dilatation of the ventricular system with a fat/CSF level in the anterior horns of the left and right lateral ventricles.  In the suprasellar region to the left of midline is a 1.6 x 1.7 cm somewhat rounded lesion measuring fat attenuation. There are multiple, rounded, sub centimeter regions of fat attenuation material scattered throughout the extra axial space.  There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or edema. Prior left temporal craniotomy site is identified. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
Ruptured dermoid tumor (inclusion cyst) of CNS; Possible developing acute stroke too early for CT diagnosis
Ruptured dermoid cyst; dermoid cyst; lipoma; chronic findings with above differential now with superimposed acute stroke to early for CT detection
Acute onset of right sided hemiparesis.
When evaluating patients seen in the emergency room setting, chronic pathology can often obscure the acute clinical problem.  In this case the patient had clinical symptoms consistent with acute stroke.  Although acute/subacute rupture of a dermoid can be symptomatic, comparison with prior films in this case demonstrated stable chronic findings.  This allowed the ER physician to treat the patient appropriately for the acute problem.
