No palpable nodule.
PTH  420 pg/mL (plasma) nl - (7-62)
Calcium 11.1 mg/dL (plasma)nl - (8.4 - 10.2)
Parathyroidectomy
20 minute early ("thyroid phase") images demonstrate normal radiotracer distribution within the thyroid gland, as well as questionably increased activity over the lower poles of the thyroid gland.

2 hour delayed ("parathyroid phase") images demonstrate decreased activity within the thyroid gland.  There is continued probable abnormal focal radiotracer accumulation over the lower poles of both lobes of the thyroid gland versus just the right lobe.  No other focal abnormal tracer accumulation is identified.
Right-sided parathyroid adenoma (surgical)
Parathyroid Adenoma(s)
Parathyroid hyperplasia
history of renal transplant with chronic hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism. No response to medical management.
