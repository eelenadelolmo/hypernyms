Neutrophils: 79%
Surgical drainage with culture of fluid.
Cultures grew out Salmonella. Treated post-op with antibiotics and steroids. Follow-up study 2 weeks post-op show marked improvement of all findings.
An enhancing extraaxial subdural fluid collection is noted over the right frontal convexity with considerable underlying intraaxial vasogenic edema and mass effect seen on the T2-weighted and FLAIR images.
Subdural Empyema
• Subdural Empyema
• Epidural abscess
• Intracerebral abscess
• Necrotic (agressive)malignancy, e.g., GBM (unlikely)
18 y.o. woman  developed new onset of seizures about one month before this study was performed. She presented with two weeks of fever and frontal headache.
Salmonella is unusual in an immuno-competent patient as this patient was. There was a history of chronic otitis media though no acute otitis was found on this admission.
