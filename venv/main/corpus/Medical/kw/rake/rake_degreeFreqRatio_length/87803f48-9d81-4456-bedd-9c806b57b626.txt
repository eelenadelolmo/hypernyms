-T-99m HDP blood flow and pool images demonstrate heterogeneously increased radiotracer accumulation in the left knee. The blood pool images also show mild, focally increased tracer accumulation in the region of the distal right femoral diaphysis

-T-99m HDP delayed (i.e. bone phase) images show heterogeneously increased radiotracer uptake in the region of the right knee, mottled accumulation in the femora, a discrete focus of increased activity in the distal right femoral diaphysis, and mottled but generally increased activity in the region of the left knee and proximal left tibia.-In-111 Tagged WBC and T-99m Sulfur Colloid: 

-In-111 scintigrams demonstrate mildly increased uptake in the right lateral tibial plateau; and moderate uptake in the left tibial metadiaphysis extending to the left lateral tibial plateau, and in the left medial tibial plateau. 

-Tc-99m SC bone marrow images demonstrate a predominantly concordant pattern with the In-111 WBC images with the following exceptions: focally increased indium-111 WBC accumulation in the left posteromedial tibial plateau without corresponding Tc-99m SC accumulation.

"22 y.o. male with multiple fractures and bilateral below the knee amputations.  Patient had a positive bone scan. Please evaluate for osteomyelitis."
The patient’s history of multiple fractures and recent surgeries makes the diagnosis of osteomyelitis difficult.  These conditions can both cause increased radiotracer uptake in a standard bone scan (Tc99m-HDP).  In order to differentiate between healing bone and infection, an In-111 tagged WBC scan is performed.  However, increased white blood cell accumulation doesn't necessarily indicate infection or inflammation, in that white blood cells also accumulate in bone marrow.  Therefore, "dual isotope" studies (i.e. In-111 WBC's plus Tc-99m sulfur colloid bone marrow imaging) are often essential in assessing for osteomyelitis.  Simultaneous acquisition can be performed with the 247keV photopeak of In-111 and the 140keV photopeak of Tc-99m.  WBC accumulation in bone without concordant sulfur colloid uptake is evidence of infection or inflammation.  

On the planar dual isotope images (i.e. In-111 WBC and Tc-99m SC), all areas of increased activity are concordant except for the posterior medial aspect of the left tibial plateau which demonstrates significantly greater uptake of In-111 than Tc-99m.  Given this single view, the diagnosis of osteomyelitis is suspected.  However, SPECT imaging of this area was performed.  This demonstrates a tract of radiotracer uptake in the posterior knee, which, if superimposed on a two-dimensional image, could appear as a single “hot” spot.  When correlated to CT images, the infected area included the posterior soft tissue and the region of the multiple bone fragments.
