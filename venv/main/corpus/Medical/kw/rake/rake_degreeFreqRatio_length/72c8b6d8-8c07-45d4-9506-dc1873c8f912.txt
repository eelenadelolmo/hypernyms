Palpable buldge at lateral right port site.
Follow up with urologist.
Right lower quadrant intramuscular herniation of fat inferior to level of umbilicus and lateral to the rectus abdominis, that does not extend through the external oblique.
Port site hernia mimicing a Spigelian hernia
Spigelian hernia
Port site hernia
Ventral hernia
56 y.o. male status post laproscopic cyroablation of right renal lesion for folow-up evaluation.
Differentated from Spigelian hernia by history of port placement at that location. In addition review of CT prior to surgery demonstrated normal abdominal wall without hernia. Spigelian hernia involves the lateral border of the rectus sheath.

Majority of ventral hernias occur midline.
