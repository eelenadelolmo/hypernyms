Companion Cases (two additional patients):

PA and lateral chest radiographs in a 20 year old woman demonstrate borderline hyperinflation, with an elongated cardiac silhouette resulting in a small heart size.

PA chest radiograph in a 21 year old woman demonstrates borderline microcardia with mildly hyperinflated lung volumes.
PA and lateral chest radiographs obtained three years after bariatric surgery demonstrate a cardiothoracic ratio of 0.37.  Surgical clips are noted inferior to the medial aspect of the left hemidiaphragm.

PA and lateral chest radiographs obtained four years after bariatric surgery, demonstrate an interval decrease in the cardiothoracic ratio, now measuring 0.33.  Surgical clips are again noted inferior to the medial aspect of the left hemidiaphragm.

Incidental finding of bilateral breast augmentation (implants).
Microcardia
• Normal variant
• Exaggerated inspiration, resulting in an elongated cardiac silhouette
• Hyperinflation as a result of COPD, with elongation of the cardiac silhouette
• Microcardia secondary to malnutrition
• Constrictive Pericarditis
41 year old woman status-post bariatric surgery, presenting with complaint of cough.
Bariatric Surgery refers to any modification of the gastrointestinal tract intended to reduce intake or absorption of food.
