A triangular metaphyseal fragment is seen dorsally-this fragment is called the Thurston-Holland sign. The fracture line travels transversely through the physis (not evident on radiograph) and then exits through the metaphysis dorsally. The epiphysis is slightly displaced dorsally. Also, Anterior displacement of the normal pronator quadratus fat pad is often seen with a distal radial fracture; however, it is not observed on this radiographic copy.
Distal Radius Fracture: Salter-Harris II
The patient is an 11yo African American boy who fell on an outstretched hand. This patient presents to ER with pain over the distal radius.
Distal fractures often result from a fall on the outstretched hand with the wrist hyperextended. Forty-five percent of all pediatric long bone fractures involve the radius, making it and it's physis the most commonly fractured long bone in the child. The peak incidence of injury corresponds to the peak velocity of growth in both sexes. Although the distal radius physis is frequently fractured, subsequent growth disturbance is unusual.
	This fracture is classified as a Salter-Harris II fracture. The Salter-Harris classification system is based on the fracture's radiographic appearance and is devised to stratify growth plate fractures; there is an increased risk of growth arrest with higher numerical fracture types (I-VI).
	Dorsal or Dorsilateral displacement of the epiphysis is almost universal with a distal radial physeal fracture.  Reduction is usually achieved and maintained relatively easily due to an intact periosteal hinge, which also prevents overreduction of the fracture. However, repeat manipulation of a type 1 or type 2 fracture is not recommended because of the increased risk of growth disturbance. When a patient presents for treatment later than 10 days after injury, manipulation of the injury is not advisable.
