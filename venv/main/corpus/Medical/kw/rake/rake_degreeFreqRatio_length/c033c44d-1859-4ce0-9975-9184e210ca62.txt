Texto: 
Abnormal gait falling to the right. Minimal 1mm pupil asymmetry.
Patient is being followed with q4 month brain MRI to exclude relapse.  Family declined genetic testing.
MR Brain:  A large cystic mass is present in the right cerebellum extending to the midline with lobulated peripheral enhancement and solid mural nodules.  This displaces and compressed the fourth ventricle.  Associated mild obstructive hydrocephalus is seen with mild transependymal flow of CSF. Multiple small rounded enhancing satellite lesions are present in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres.  Enhanced images of the brain demonstrate an orbital lesion suggesting retinal angiomatosis.

CECT A/P: An ovoid nonenhancing lesion is seen in the left renal cortex.
Von Hippel-Lindau Disease
DDx for posterior fossa mass: Hemangioblastoma, pilocytic astrocytoma, brainstem glioma, ependymoma, medulloblastoma.
12 y/o WF with 2 mo hx of increasing headache and upper cervical pain, recent disequilibrium, double vision, and slowing speech. Family hx of father dying of brain tumor at age 25.
