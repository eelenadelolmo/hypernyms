A1- Right middle lobe infiltrate with fluid in the minor fissure and possible involvement of the lower segment of the right upper lobe. Right pleural effusion.
   A2- Saccular outpouching of the esophageal lumen arising on the posterior wall at the level of the pharyngoesophageal junction and displacing the esophagus anteriorly.
   Diagnosis-A very large Zenker's diverticula from which the patient has aspirated and developed an aspiration pneumonia. As the diverticula enlarges it extends downward and posteriorly, displacing the cervical esophagus anteriorly and compressing the lumen. Due to its posterior location a Zenker's is best seen in lateral or oblique views

   B1- An overexposed film showing a fusiform diverticula of the esophageal lumen located in the mid-esophagus.
   Diagnosis-A mid-esophageal diverticuli. Such diverticula can be funnel, cone, tent or fusiform in shape. They are best visualized in the LAO position and are often found in association with calcified mediastinal nodes from healed granulomatous disease (see discussion).

   C1- Large cystic structure overlying right hemidiaphragm which contains an air fluid level. There is also an air fluid level in the upper esophagus at the level of the clavicles.
   C2- Large diverticula off the lower esophagus just above the gastroesophageal junction. The diverticula has a short broad neck.
   C3- Upon valsalva the diverticula does not appear to change, and there is no gastric mucosal pattern seen in the diverticula. This, therefore, does not likely represent a hiatal hernia. Note the NG tube in place.
   Diagnosis- The proximity to the diaphragm and the characteristic short broad neck of this diverticula make it an epiphrenic diverticula. The diverticula should have a smooth contour as irregularity may suggest infection or malignancy. Small epiphrenic diverticula may resemble esophageal ulcers but will usually have abnormal mucosal patterns in the adjacent esophagus.

An esophageal diverticulum is an outpouching of the esophageal wall which may contain all layers of the esophageal wall (true diverticulum) or only mucosa and submucosa herniating through the muscularis (false diverticulum). It is believed that the true diverticula is. formed by a traction phenomenon secondary to adjacent inflammatory tissue, while the false diverticula if formed by increased intraesophageal pressure (pulsion). The most useful classification ,however, is that according to anatomic site. The three most common acquired esophageal diverticula are those of the posterior wall of the pharyngoesophageal segment (Zenker's), diverticula of the interaorticobronchial or interbronchial area (mid-esophageal), and lastly, epiphrenic diverticula.
     A Zenker's diverticula lies in the midline of the posterior wall at the pharyngoesophageal junction (approx. C5-6 level). The development of a Zenker's diverticula is apparently related to premature contraction of the cricopharyngeus muscle, creating increased intraluminal pressure and a pulsion diverticuli at an anatomic weak point between the oblique and circular fibers of the muscle.
     Zenker's diverticula are often asymptomatic and are noted only on esophagrams done for other reasons. When symptomatic they may present with gradual onset of increased salivation, throat discomfort, regurgitation and paroxysmal cough especially after a meal or while sleeping. Regurgitation of food eaten earlier in the absence of dysphagia is highly suggestive of a Zenker's. Bad breath,an unpleasent taste in the mouth, and gurgling noises after drinking liquids can be additional symptoms. Recurrent aspiration pneumonia may Occur, and although be quite subtle, is potentially serious.
     Mid-esophageal or thoracic diverticula are most often found in the middle third of the esophagus opposite the bifurcation of the trachea where the esophagus is closest to the mediastinal lymph nodes. Mid-esophageal diverticula are usually traction diverticula that develop in response to the pull of fibrous adhesions following infection of those nodes. The specific name for such a diverticula is an interbronchial diverticula and they are the most common type of acquired esophageal diverticula.They are most often found on the right anterolateral wall of the interbronchial segment. Precipitating causes include tuberculosis, mediastinal histoplasmosis, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
     Pulsion mid-esophageal diverticuli also occur, but are much less common. They usually arise in an anatomically weak area on the anterolateral wall of the esophagus, between the inferior border of the aortic arch and the upper external margin of the left main bronchus. This diverticula is referred to as an interaorticobronchial diverticula and because of its position, can only be seen in the RAO projection where it is seperated from esophageal lumen superimposition.
     Mid-esophageal diverticula usually have a wide opening, and their sacks are usually higher than their necks. For these reasons they usually do not retain food and are thus often asymptomatic. Dysphagia may be a rare complaint, and mediastinal abcess or esophagobronchial fistula occur even less often.
     Epiphrenic diverticula are true outpouchings that occur in the distal 10 cm of the esophagus. Epiphrenic diverticula are rather rare, and are most often seen on the lateral walls of the esophagus-usually the right. Unlike the other diverticula, epiphrenic diverticula can be found in young patients, although such congenital forms are extremely rare. More often, epiphrenic diverticula are associated with increased esophageal motor activity and abnormal LES relaxation. This creates zones of increased intraluminal pressure, where the diverticula subsequently occur. Reflux esophagitis, with its associated motor abnormalities, may also contribute to the development of such diverticula. Epiphrenic diverticula are most often asymptomatic. Large diverticula, however, may produce dysphagia, regurgitation and bronchial aspiration. The regurgitation from epiphrenic diverticula is characteristically of large volume and at night. Stasis and infection in the diverticula may cause phlegmonous esophagitis. Squamous cell CA and leiomyoma within an epiphrenic diverticula have also been reported. Rarely, epiphrenic diverticula may spontaneously perforate or develop a bezoar
