Temp: 99.2.  Patient was tender to palpation in the right upper and lower quadrants, with rebound tenderness in the RLQ, McBurney&#8217;s point (1/3 distance from right anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus).  Elevated WBC at 15.2.
An open appendectomy was performed and an incidental Meckel&#8217;s diverticulum was found and also removed.  The appendix was enlarged with significant erythema.  Antibiotics were given pre and post-op to decrease risk of infection.
Calcified fecalith in right lower quadrant, superior to iliac spine in mid clavicular line, seen best in supine film.
Acute appendicitis
Meckel diverticulitis, phlebolith, bone island (should not move in relation to iliac spine with repositioning of patient), Calcified lymph node, and appediceal tumor.
