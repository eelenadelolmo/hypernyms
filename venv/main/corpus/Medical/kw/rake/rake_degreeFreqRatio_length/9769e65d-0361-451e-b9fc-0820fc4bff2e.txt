Incomplete.
Multiple T2 hypointense mass lesions throughout the uterus, consistent with leiomyomas. 
 -Subserosal
 -Intramural 
 -Sub-mucosal pedunculated within the endometrial cavity. 

Transitional zone diffusely thickened with multiple T2 hyerintensities throughout the myometrium.

Multiple T2-bright cystic structures within the cervix.
Adenomyosis
-Adenomyosis
-Endometriosis
-Leiomyomata
-Nabothian cysts
The patient reported subjective menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea.  Outside sonofound leiomyomatous uterus.  Interested in uterine artery embolization for relief of her symptoms.
The importancce of imaging the uterus prior to performing uterine artery embolization (UAE) is demonstrated in this patient with symptomatology which may be relatable to fibroids or secondary to adenomyosis.    Therapies for adenomyosis include hormonal and hysterectomy.  UAE may be curative for patient with simple fibroid uterus whereas this patient should understand the risk of a nontherapeutic result after UAE secondary to unresolved adenomyosis.
