Unknown--patient already diagnosed and being followed by primary care pediatrician.
AP radiographs of the bilateral hands demonstrate short 4th and 5th metacarpal bones on the left and short 3rd and 4th metacarpals on the right.
Short 4th Metacarpals
- Idiopathic 
- Metabolic abnormality such as pseudo-hypoparathyroidism (i.e. PTH resistance - Albrightâ€™s hereditary osteodystrophy), or pseudopseudo-hypoparathyroidism (i.e., pseudohypo-PTH but with normal calcium level) 
- Turnerâ€™s syndrome
- Basal cell nevus syndrome
- Trauma (would expect unilateral)
- Infarction (would expect unilateral)
Short stature
