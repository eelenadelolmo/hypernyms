Recommended follow-up (this patient): MRI of right knee and thigh with orthopedic oncology follow-up especially when patient is symptomatic. CT is also useful for identifying the cartilaginous calcifications.

Treatment:  Asymptomatic lesions are often found incidentally and, when stable, can be followed with radiographs and clinical examination. As a baseline, MRI is useful in determining the thickness of the cartilaginous cap and for evaluating exostoses that become painful in follow-up. When the cartilaginous cap is thicker than 1 cm, there is increased possibilibity for malignant degeneration and surgical intervention is done.  Besides malignant degeneration as the cause for pain, patients may be symptomatic because of pressure of the osteochondroma on  surrounding structures  and subsequent inflammatory changes that require surgery for relief of symptoms  At surgery, the cap or perichondrium should be removed because with partial resection, recurrence rate is higher. Also, in patients who have not reached skeletal maturity, care must be taken not to damage the growth plate. The local recurrence rate is in the range of 2-5%.
Posterior-anterior (PA) radiographs of  the right femur and right knee show a pedunculated, calcified mass projecting from the right medial femur with continuity with the medullary cavity. Its stalk measures 3.5 cm x 1.0 cm and ovoid shaped head measuring 2.8 cm x 1.9 cm. This mass shows rings and stippled calcifications consistent with cartilage. 

The base of the stalk is fractured approximately approximately 3.5 cm above the adductor tubercle, near the distal point of insertion of the vastus medialis muscle. 

No other bony or soft tissue abnormalities are noted in the radiographs of the right hip, femur or proximal tibia and fibula nor is there other evidence of fracture in any of these structures.
Osteochondroma
Osteochondroma
18 y/o male with a history of right thigh / knee pain and associated inability to bear weight on right leg after sustaining blunt trauma to right medial upper leg 1 day previously.
This patient was especially interesting due to the nature of presentation, i.e. with fracture of the osteochondroma (exostosis). The patient was unaware of this thigh lesion  although it had grown to considerable size. In all other aspects this findings were classical with respect to demographics, location and radiographic morphology.
