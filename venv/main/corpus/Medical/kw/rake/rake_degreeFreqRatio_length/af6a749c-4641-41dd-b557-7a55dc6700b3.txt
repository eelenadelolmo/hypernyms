The patient received antibiotics, fluids, and O2. O2 was initially given via NC, but was eventually replaced by CPAP to maintain oxygenation levels above 95%. She also received 3 units of PRBCs when other supportive measures were ineffective at resolving her symptoms.  After her transfusions, the patient improved and was in stable condition.
Initial PA/Lat showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Prominent pulmonary vasculature and basilar increased interstitial markings and bilateral small pleural effusions. Also noted are a surgical clip in the right upper quadrant and absence of the spleen shadow. No osseous abnormalities are ntoed. 

Follow-up portable radioagraph obtained after marked worsening of clinical status revealed new large bilateral effusions and evidence of bilateral lower and right middle lobe air space disease.

13 y/o female who presented to the ER shortly after onset of sore throat, cough and central sternal chest pain.  The pain was central sternal, sharp, and worse with cough and deep inspiration.  On arrival to ER she was febrile to 102.1 with O2 sat 93% on RA.    She was placed on 2L O2 by NC with sats rising to 99-100%.  On the day prior to admission, she received Hep A, HPV, varicella and flu vaccinations.
As in most cases of acute chest syndrome (ACS), the exact trigger is uncertain, but she had several vaccinations the day prior that may have been the trigger for her ACS. 

As is often the case, the initial chest radiograph shows relatively mild acute changes with increased interstitial markings and small bilateral effusions. Without the clinical history of sickle cell disease one can still suggest the diagnosis of early acute chest syndrome based on the clinical presentation and additional findings on the radiograph. In this case, these include (1) the enlarged cardiac silhouette (an uncommon finding in children) due to cardiomegaly related to chronic anemia; (2) the absence of the spleen shadow due to autoinfarction; and (3) the cholecystectomy clip (also unusual in children) related to pigment gallstones from break down of sickled red cells. Additional osseous findings, not observed in this patient, may further support the chest radiograph diagnosis of sickle cell disease, specifically, H-shaped vertebral bodies, due to infarction of the growth centers of the end plates, and avascular necrosis of the humeral heads.

As this pateint's clinical status worsened, dramatic differences were noted in her chest radiograph, showing large pleural effusions and air space consolidation. This progression is common in the course of ACS.
