Fever with erythema and edema overlying left eyelid
Admission with 50% undergoing subsequent sinusotomy of the abscess using a nasal approach (+/-) drain which should be left in place for one week.  Once cultures are obtained from the fluid, IV antibiotics should be instituted immediately in order to prevent meningitis and overwhelming systemic infection.  First choice antibiotic for children includes cefuroxime 100mg/kg per day divided into three or four doses parenterally.  Antibiotics should be continued empirically with most sources recommending a minimum of 10 days.  Repeat of sinus CT with contrast should be repeated post surgically as well as after discontinuation of antibiotics to ensure resolution.
Rim enhancing homogenous soft tissue density within the left ethmoid sinus which is eroding through the lamina papyracea.  Subperiosteal abscess 1.4x 0.8cm displacing the medial rectus muscle.  Soft tissue edema in medial periorbital region with inflammatory changes within the fat of the conus.  Mild proptosis of the left eye.
Ethmoiditis with subperiosteal abscess of the left medial orbit
Left ethmoidal sinusitis with abscess, mucocele, orbital dermoid cyst, primary conjunctival cyst, sweat gland cyst, lacrimal gland cyst, lymphangioma, idiopathic orbital inflammation, and orbital granulomatous inflammations
20 month old boy with recurrent orbital redness and bulging eye.
Abscesses and orbital cellulitis are characterized by massive accumulation of PMNs.  Causative agent can usually be demonstrated with staining following aspiration or surgical drainage.  These usually occur in conjunction with adjacent sinusitis but may also occur after orbital trauma or with systemic infections.  Offending pathogens include a variety of bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic etiologies, however, most cases arise from bacterial infections of the sinuses.  These bacterial pathogens in children include those of typical URI etiologies such as S. Pneumoniae, H. Influenza and S. Aureus.  Pseudomonas and E. Coli are also less common causes of orbital cellulitis.  

Patients typically present with the sudden onset of pain, eyelid edema, conjunctival hyperemia and chemosis and sometimes proptosis, diplopia, increased IOP, and blepharoptosis.  Orbital cellulitis is one of the most common causes of proptosis in children less than five.  Patients may also experience fever, malaise, and leukocytosis with signs of sinusitis.

Subperiosteal abscess is a purulent foci within the adjacent subperiosteal space that can lead to abaxial displacement, local tenderness, and a possible fluctuant mass.  Abscess formation may be rapid with destruction of tissue planes depending on the severity of the offending pathogen.  Clinical clues may include profound proptosis with a functional deficit in the absence of striking concomitant inflammatory signs such as chemosis and lid injection.  
 
Typical CT features of a subperiosteal abscess include (+/-) an enhancing capsule with smooth contoured periorbital lesion adjacent to an opacified sinus.  Cellulitis would appear as lid edema, sinus opafication with mucosal thickening.  Following contrast infusion, periosteum may be seen to enhance therefore giving rise to an enhancing capsule as seen in this patient.

Complications include severe septicemia with resultant meningitis and cavernous sinus thrombosis; however, with the institution of immediate incision and drainage with appropriate IV antibiotics fatal outcomes have dropped dramatically in the past decade.

Cavernous sinus thrombosis would present with headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, and varying levels of consciousness in addition to the typical signs and symptoms of orbital cellulitis.

Patients should be monitored while hospitalized for worsening symptoms despite antibiotic treatment in order to prevent these fatal outcomes.
