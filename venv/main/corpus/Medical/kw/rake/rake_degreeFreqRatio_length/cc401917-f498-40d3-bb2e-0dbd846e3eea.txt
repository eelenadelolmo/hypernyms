The patient appeared thin and pale, but otherwise well.  Laboratory workup was significant for a hemoglobin of 10.2 and a hematocrit of 30.2.
Patient is being treated with chemotherapy (CHOP).  He will have follow up imaging after his third cycle to assess tumor response.
CT angiogram was performed demonstrating a large soft tissue mass present within the mesentery measuring 10.3 by 7.3 cm in its greatest dimension.  The mass appears continuous with multiple loops of small bowel, several of which demonstrate diffuse wall thickening.  The mass is seen to encase the superior mesenteric artery, which remains patent.  There is graying of the surrounding mesenteric fat, as well as, scattered lymph nodes.  There is central low attenuation of the mass, which may represent necrosis.
Small Bowel Lymphoma
Small bowel adenocarcinoma
Metastastic disease
GIST
Leiomyosarcoma
Small bowel lymphoma
Patient had a 2-month history of increasing intestinal/epigastric pain after large meals.  The patient also reported a twenty-pound weight loss in the past 2-months.  The patient denied night sweats, fevers, melena, hematochezia or shortness of breath.  Past medical history is significant for excision of a melanoma from his chin 2-years prior, as well as, a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atherosclerotic disease.
The most common location for lymphoma of the gastrointestinal tract is in the stomach. However, the small bowel is the second most common site. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is the third most common malignancy of the small bowel, representing between 10-20% of all small bowel malignancies.  Because lymphoma is a soft, pliable tumor, it tends to cause bowel wall thickening and dilatation of the bowel lumen opposed to obstruction.  In this case, the lymphoma was seen to encase the superior mesenteric artery and other mesenteric vessels.  The images with oral contrast best demonstrate the dilatation of the small bowel loops.
