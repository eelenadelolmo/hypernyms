5-6 mm diameter, well-defined, hyperechoic solid lesion on the surface of the inferior aspect of the left testis.  This could be either based on the tunica or intratesticular and exophytic.  

Intraoperative ultrasound of the surgically exposed left testis confirms the findings.  An image was obtained also from the other side of this lesion to rule out an intratesticular abnormality beneath the lesion, which on real-time observation of the testis showed that it was based on the tunica.
