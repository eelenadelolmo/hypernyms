Pathology: 
 - CD20 positive small lymphoid cells and plasmacytic cells
 - CD3 less frequent, positive in 1/3 of lymphoid cells
 - CD5, CD10 negative
 - In Situ Hybridization â€“ monoclonal lambda positive
Low grade B-cell lymphoma MALT type with plasmacytic differentiation
Low grade B-cell lymphoma MALT type with plasmacytic differentiation
Radiation to eye and orbit
Persistence of subretinal deposits

Body and Head MRI unremarkable

LP normal

Vitrectomy: scant cells consistent with chronic inflammation.  No cytologic atypia or monoclonal B cell population

No definite response to systemic steroids

Variable visual acuity 20/20-20/40

Increasing subretinal fluid
Is the choroid a primary site for involvement with lymphoproliferative neoplasms?
What is the spectrum of lymphoproliferative neoplasms occurring at that site?
