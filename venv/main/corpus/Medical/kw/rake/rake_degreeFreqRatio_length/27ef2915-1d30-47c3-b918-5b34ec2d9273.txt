Severe ankle tenderness, swelling and bruising
Not reported by the author of this case.  

However, these fractures are often treated with ORIF to prevent or mitigate growth deformities.
Conventional radiographs demonstrate fusion of the medial portion of the distal left tibial physis.  A fracture through the epiphysis at the margin of the fused and non fused portions of the physis is seen.  The non fused portion of the physis is fractured.

Multiplanar reformed CT demonstrates a coronal fracture though the posterior third of the tibial metaphysis which terminates at the level of the physis.

Ankle injury
Triplane fractures of the distal tibia involve perisagital fractures extending from the joint space through the epiphysis to the physis, an axial fracture through a portion of the physis, and an coronal oblique fracture through the metaphysis. The locations and extent of the three fractures involving these orthoginal planes vary depending on the extent to which the physis has already fused.

Per Wheeless' textbook of orthopedics:

The mechanism of injury is forced external rotation. The anterior part of fracture begins intra-articularly in saggital plane; when frx reaches epiphyseal plate, it courses laterally in horizontal plane; the posterior portion changes direction upward in saggital plane.
