Complications associated with ovarian teratoma include infection, torsion and the possibility of malignant transformation. Tumor rupture, can result in granulomatous peritonitis secondary to leakage of the sebaceous contents into the peritoneum.
Mixed echogenic mass containing a fat-fluid level, in addition there is a mural component with acoustic shadowing. 

Axial contrast CT images demonstrate, two cysts with a mixture of fat attenuation and calcification. A round mural nodule is seen within the cavity and has a feathery appearance at the fatty boundary most likely where hair emanates.

The word teratoma is derived from a Greek term meaning "monster tumor". Mature cystic teratomas are cystic tumors composed of well-differentiated derivations from no less than two of the three germ cell layers.
It is the most common ovarian mass in children, however, the mean age of patients affected by mature cystic teratomas is 30.
Most teratomas are asymptomatic, however, abdominal pain or other nonspecific symptoms do occur in the minority of patients.
 
Ultraound features that suggest the specific diagnosis of dermoid cyst are the presence of hair, teeth, or mural nodules (Rokitansky protuberances). However, US has restricted sensitivity, and therefore imaging by CT is recommended for further evaluation.
