Wright’s test was negative bilaterally. Costoclavicular maneuver elicited increased bilateral tingling in 4th and 5th digits, decreased radial pulse bilaterally. Adson’s Sign was negative bilaterally.
The best imaging test to screen for scoliosis is a standing PA film. In a patient with scoliosis, this will show >10° of spinal angulation. In addition, for a diagnosis of scoliosis to be made, there should also be vertebral rotation with the most rotation occurring at the apices of the spinal curve. If there is no rotation, other causes should be considered, such as bony tumor, intraspinal pathology, and nerve root irritation (3). 

If a patient presents with back pain, a lateral spine film is recommended. This is the best test to assess for spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, infection, and bony destruction. MRI of the spine is recommended for pre-surgical evaluation, if the patient is less than 10 years old, if there is a left thoracic curvature, and if there is neurologic abnormality on exam (3). 

To quantify the angle of curvature, radiologists measure the Cobb Angle. To determine this measurement, the radiologist picks the upper and lower vertebrae that make up the ends of the spinal curvature. A line is drawn parallel to the endplate of the superior end vertebrae, and another line is drawn parallel to the endplate of the inferior end vertebrae. Two intersecting lines are then drawn, perpendicular to the two lines previously discussed. The intersection angle of the two perpendicular lines is the Cobb angle, which is measured by the radiologist (4).

The main goal of scoliosis treatment is to keep the spinal curvature under 50° when the patient reaches spinal maturity. To assess the patient’s risk of curvature progression, one must assess the amount of growth remaining. If the patient has more growth expected, there is an increased risk of the curve worsening. If the patient has nearly completed growth, then the risk of curve worsening is minimal. Observation and regular follow-ups are appropriate if the curve is <25°, the child is still growing (skeletally immature) (3).

Primary care physicians should refer to an orthopedic specialist in several circumstances. If the patient is younger than age 10 and has a curve greater than 10°, or if a patient is older than 10 and has a curve greater than 20°, he or she should be sent to a specialist for treatment and assessment. Patients with atypical features, back pain, or neurologic abnormalities should also be referred to orthopedics for specialized care (3).

Bracing is used for skeletally immature patients that have progressing curves between 25° and 50°. The brace must be custom fitted to each individual patient. It does not permanently improve or correct the curve; rather, it simply prevents progression of the curve. However, this treatment will not be successful unless the patient is very compliant with wearing the brace for the specified number of hours per day (3, 4).

Surgical treatment by orthopedics is recommended if the curve is greater than 45° in a skeletally immature patient, and greater than 50° in a skeletally mature patient. Surgery is also acceptable for patients that are unhappy with their physical appearance. Procedures are normally performed during adolescence, and consist mainly of spinal fusion with rod placement. Less commonly, instrumentation without fusion is performed, mainly in young children. Fusion is not desirable in a young child because it would stop growth of the spine. If instrumentation without fusion is performed, the child will need constant bracing after the surgery (3).

Other treatments for scoliosis include chiropractic manipulation, electric stimulation, and physical therapy (4).

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, degenerative disc disease
Scoliosis can be broadly classified into structural and non-structural (or functional) scoliosis. Structural scoliosis is the classic definition of scoliosis, in which there is a fixed curve to the spine that develops during growth. The vast majority of structural scoliosis cases do not have a known cause, so they are referred to as idiopathic scoliosis. Idiopathic scoliosis can be further categorized by the age in which the curve develops. Infantile idiopathic scoliosis begins between the ages 0 and 3 years, and accounts for 0.5% of idiopathic scoliosis. Juvenile idiopathic scoliosis occurs between the ages of 4 and 10 years, and accounts for 10.5% of idiopathic scoliosis overall. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis occurs in children 10 years or older and is the most common form of idiopathic scoliosis, accounting for 89% of cases (3, 4). 

Structural scoliosis can also uncommonly be caused by other conditions. Congenital causes include Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, neurofibromatosis, and skeletal dysplasias. Neuromuscular causes include tethered spinal cord syndrme, syringomyelia, poliomyelitis, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophies, and spinal muscular atrophy. Infectious causes include pyogenic osteomyelitis, tuberculosis, and brucellosis. Scoliosis can be caused by tumors, including osteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma, meningioma, neurofibroma, astrocytoma, ependymoma, and metastasis. Other causes include birth defects, injury, and rheumatic diseases (4).
	
Non-structural or functional scoliosis occurs when the spine is normal in structure, but appears curved due to a temporary and changing condition. For example, a leg-length discrepancy or muscle spasm can cause the spine to appear curved, although the spine is structurally normal. This can also occur due to inflammatory conditions causing pain, such as appendicitis (4).

This patient has a structural adolescent idiopathic scoliosis which was treated with a Harrington rod, which is visualized on plain radiographs of the chest.
53 year old male who presents to the chiropractor’s office with complaints of back and neck pain after three previous motor vehicle accidents and a medical history positive for scoliosis, which was diagnosed at the age of 15. Per the patient, he had only slight symptoms of back pain with physical activity that he considered to be normal prior to his diagnosis. As the diagnosis was made after he had already grown significantly, the patient underwent surgical treatment and received a Herrington rod. He states that he recovered well from the procedure over the subsequent year and was able to return to playing high school basketball during his senior year. He was pain free until his 30’s, at which point he began to notice some discomfort and stiffness in his back which he attributes to the presence of the Herrington rod. He treated these symptoms successfully with aspirin and Tylenol.
	Fourteen years prior to evaluation, the patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident (MVA) in which his car was struck head-on by another vehicle. This caused a “whiplash” injury in which his neck came suddenly forward. This injury caused the patient to experience neck pain, but with rehabilitation he returned to his baseline.
	More recently, three years prior to evaluation, the patient experienced another MVA in which he was waiting to make a left-hand turn, but was struck from the passenger side by a vehicle in opposing traffic. This accident caused him pain in the neck, mid-back, and lower back areas. He also noted numbness in the 4th and 5th digits of each hand and feeling that his legs were “locking up.” He also experienced a left-sided headache. 
	About six months prior to evaluation, the patient experienced a third MVA in which his vehicle was struck on the front passenger side by another vehicle. This caused the patient to have neck pain rated a 9/10, mid-back pain that radiates to the anterior chest rated a 9/10, lower back pain rated 9/10, and frontal headaches.
	When the patient is seen at the office, he states that he has neck pain present on both sides, which is stabbing in quality. The pain is relieved with lateral flexion of the neck and extension. However, neck flexion worsens his neck pain as well as his lower back pain. His neck pain is also worsened by head turning. He notes that he hears “cracking” in his neck when he moves it. The patient notes tingling down the side of his arms into his 4th and 5th fingers on each side, though these symptoms are worse on the left. He also feels that his grip is weaker on the left side. The patient states that overall, his back is very stiff and he cannot move it well in any direction. He has lower back pain that is also stabbing in quality on both sides. He notes that he has decreased sensation in his left toes. He also states that he experienced a fall approximately four months ago because his leg “gave out.” 
	The patient’s primary care physician had been following him for chronic back pain. He was initially treated with Lyrica for his pain, but could not tolerate the medication due to nightmares. He also previously tried Lortab, which he did not like due to the addictive potential. He currently takes Ibuprofen to manage his pain symptoms, as well as regular chiropractic appointments. He also notes that alcohol decreases his pain, which leads him to drink nearly every day. He also takes sleep pills when his pain keeps him up, but he cannot remember the name of the medication that he uses.

Past Medical History: 
This patient has a past medical history pertinent for scoliosis, diagnosed at age 15 as discussed above. He also has a history of hypertension managed with amlodipine. Surgical history includes spinal surgery as described above and a thyroid lobectomy for suspected malignancy, though pathology returned benign. He is a non-smoker and drinks “1/2 pint of whiskey and a couple of beers” almost daily as a self-management for pain. His family history is non-contributory.

Scoliosis is a disorder of the spinal column, normally arising during adolescence. In scoliosis, there is lateral curvature of the spinal column as well as rotation of the vertebrae. The overall prevalence of scoliosis is 1-3/100 individuals. It is equally frequent in boys and girls, but girls are more susceptible to worsening of their curvature and are more likely to require treatment (1). In addition, girls are 8 times more likely to have curves greater than 30° than are boys. If a child has a sibling with scoliosis, he or she is at 7 times increased risk of developing the condition themselves. In addition, children of parents with a history of scoliosis are at 3 times increased risk, so they should be routinely screened. Signs and symptoms of scoliosis normally start during the pre-pubescent growth spurt that occurs between the ages of 9 and 15 years (3). 

Patients with scoliosis usually do not present with pain, although about 25% of adolescent patients with the condition present this way. Physical exam signs include posterior chest wall prominence, uneven shoulder height, and increased prominence of one shoulder blade when compared to the other. Patients may also present with an uneven waist or hips, and also with a noticeable difference in breast size (1). Physicians should also look for symptoms that may point to a genetic disorder. For example, joint or skin hyperlaxity could indicate Ehlers- Danlos syndrome. Tall stature, long fingers, and increased arm span/height ratio could indicate Marfan’s syndrome. Cafe-au-lait spots and axillary freckles point to a diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis (3).

This patient has adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), diagnosed at age 15, which was treated with a Harrington rod. The Harrington rod treatment fell out of favor in the late 1990’s in favor of newer surgical instrumentation that led to more physiologic spine range of motion. A study performed by Bartie et al. examined patients with AIS that had a Harrington rod and compared them to normal control patients to assess whether these patients were subject to increased lower back pain (5). The study found that patients with history of AIS and Harrington rod placement had significantly increased incidence of lower back pain. A study performed by Danielsson et. al. examined 142 patients with AIS and Harrington rod placement and compared them to control patients (6). The studied patients had significantly more degenerative disc changes than the controls. They also had more frequent lumbar pain, though the majority of the pain was rated as mild. Only 25% of the patients admitted having daily pain. There was no difference in assessment of health-related quality of life between the patients and controls.

Based on the above research, the patient’s Harrington rod likely made him vulnerable to degenerative disc changes and lower back pain at baseline. The patient then was involved in three motor vehicle accidents that further damaged his spinal column. Furthermore, the patient’s Harrington rod placement likely made him susceptible to increased damage to the spinal column when faced with this type of acute trauma. This is especially true of the unfused vertebral levels directly above and below the Harrington rod placement, which are more vulnerable to injury due to decreased range of motion of their neighboring vertebrae. This correlates with the patient’s clinical symptoms, as well as the significant findings of disc pathology at the C4-C5 and C5-C6 levels and a nerve conduction study that verifies these radiologic findings; the patient also has significant herniation below the end of the Harrington rod at L2-L3 and L4-L5. 

It is also important to note that this patient self-medicates with alcohol nearly daily to decrease his pain. This finding is critical, as patients with chronic pain should be screened for alcohol and drug problems closely.
