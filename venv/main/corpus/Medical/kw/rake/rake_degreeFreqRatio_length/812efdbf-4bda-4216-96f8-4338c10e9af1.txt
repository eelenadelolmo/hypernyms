PE:  Abdominal exam revealed an enlarged liver and generalized abdominal tenderness.

Labs:  Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) >363000, AST 819 and ALT 129, LDH 1675
The patient is currently undergoing chemotherapy to attempt to shrink the tumor size.  If that is successful, surgical resection will be considered.
â€¢ Axial CT images of the abdomen with IV contrast reveal:
- Enlarged liver
- Hepatic parenchyma almost entirely replaced by heterogeneous low attenuation masses
- No calcifications
- Scattered areas of necrosis
Hepatoblastoma
â€¢ Hepatoblastoma
â€¢ Infantile hemangioendothelioma
â€¢ Metastatic neuroblastoma
One year old boy with a 10 day history of fevers, lethargy, and abdominal pain.  No history of prematurity or gestational or delivery complications.  The patient was "healthy" until 10 days ago.
â€¢ This patient was not premature and usually hepatoblastomas present in premature infants.  
â€¢ Only 20% of cases have elevated liver transaminases along with an elevated AFP (alpha-feto-protein).  
â€¢ Tumor calcifications  are seen in only 30-50% of cases, this patient did not have any calcifications.  
â€¢ Only one-third of patients have a tumor with suitable size and location so that complete excision can be attempted.
