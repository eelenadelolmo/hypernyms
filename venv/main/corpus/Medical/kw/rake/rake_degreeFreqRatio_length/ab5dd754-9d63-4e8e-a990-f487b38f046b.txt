PHYSICAL EXAM:	Cutaneous examination revealed a 3 cm well circumscribed, round, pink, minimally elevated plaque on the patient's left lower abdomen. The lesion had small superficial excoriations on its surface.
HISTOPATHOLOGY:  Sections revealed delicate, lacelike and anastomizing epithelial strands composed of basaloid cells extending from the epidermis into the dermis. These strands were embedded in a fibromucinous stroma. In many areas, stromal retraction from the epithelial cords was present. Ductal structures were absent and foci of blue basaloid budding were seen extending from the epithelial strands.
The lesion was completely excised.
FIBROEPITHELIOMA OF PINKUS (1997 Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, Case#25) Presented by: George C. Keough, CPT, MC, USAR; Martha L. McCollough, COL, MC, USA
presented with a history of a slowly enlarging pink plaque on her left abdomen. The lesion had been present for at least 10 years and had recently begun to ooze small amounts of serosanguinous fluid.
