Surgical decompression of mass.
Motor oil consistency fluid aspirated from mass.
Cholesterol granules present in mass as well.
Very Large extra-axial skull base mass.
Mass is hyperintense on T1 and T2 MRI sequences, does not lose signal with fat suppression and does not enhance.
Secondary hydrocephalus.
Craniopharyngioma
• Dermoid Cyst
• Epidermoid Cyst
• Craniopharyngioma
• Rathke Cleft Cyst
• Optic Nerve/hypothalamic Glioma
8 year old girl who noted problems seeing the board while at school.
Normal growth and development until problem with visual fields.
Ophthalmologist visit prompted MRI scan.
This lesion is somewhat atypical in that no calcification was seen in the mass and no solid components.  The lesion is also larger than the typical craniopharyngioma.

The lack of clinical symptoms prior to the sudden loss of vision is also somewhat surprising in view of the very large size of the lesion.
