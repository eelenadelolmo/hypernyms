Thin-appearing woman in no apparent distress with normal laboratory values.
Treatment of the superior mesenteric artery syndrome may involve supplemental nutrition (such as TPN) to assist the patient in rebuilding the intra-abdominal fat stores which in turn will expand the region between the aorta and superior mesenteric artery. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to relieve the anatomic obstruction.
The upper GI series image demonstrates a focal narrowing of the duodenum as it crosses the midline with some proximal dilatation. The CT image shows compression of the third portion of the doudenum as it passes between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery together with proximal duodenal dilatation.
Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome
A constricting tumoral mass or focal inflammation/scarring could result in similar findings on the upper GI series but the CT image demonstrates an anatomic restriction is most likely responsible and is consistent with the clincal presentation.
50 y/o female with three month history of weight loss and early satiety.
A recent illness caused weight loss in this patient which resulted in loss of intra-abdominal fat. This presumably resulted in compression of the duodenum between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery leading to early satiety and further progression of weight loss.
