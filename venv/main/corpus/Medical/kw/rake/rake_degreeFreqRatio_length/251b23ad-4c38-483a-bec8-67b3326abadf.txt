Unremarkable
Conservative treatment, the patient was followed daily with chest x-rays until he was asymptomatic 3 days after the incident
Plain film: 
PA veiw- unremarkable
lateral view- curvilinear lucency in the anterior mediastinum, silhouetting the ascending aorta and anterior portions of the pericardium.

CT: air throghout the mediastinum, especially about the esophagus
Pneumomediastinum
Pneumopericardium
Medial pneumothorax
Pneumomediastinum
Choked on pizza crust earlier in the day, now with pain on inspiration
The diagnosis in this case was made after careful examination of the lateral radiograph as the PA projection was unremarkable.  None of the commonly discussed signs of pneumomediastinum (Nacleiros V sign, double bronchial wall sign, continuous diaphragm sign,"ring around the artery" sign, tubular artery sign, extrapleural sign) were evident in this case.  The diagnosis was confirmed by CT and demonstrated the likely etiology as a small esophageal perforation, based on distribution of the air and the patient's history.
