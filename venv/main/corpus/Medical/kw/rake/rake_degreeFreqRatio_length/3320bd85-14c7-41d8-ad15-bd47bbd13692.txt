PA chest radiograph demonstrate a well circumscribed opacity within the LUL. The lateral view demonstrates a well circumscribed opacity within the LUL, obscuring the trachea.

Axial contrast enhanced CT demonstrates a well circumscribed nodule in the LUL, with a lobulated border, and multiple clumps of calcium or ‘popcorn’ calcifications, as well as discrete areas of fat dispersed throughout the lesion.
