• No current physical exam findings
• LP: 5 oligoclonal bands on CSF, lumbar puncture sampling
• Patient will continue to follow-up with Neurology
• Repeat scans will be performed when clinically indicated
Within the right corona radiata, there is continued presence of a T2 and FLAIR hyperintense lesion, which displays interval slight decrease in size and clarity of margins.  Additionally, there is no longer post-contrast enhancement of the lesion.  Gray matter/white matter differentiation is, otherwise, preserved throughout.

Prior study dated 1 week earlier shows T2 high signal within the corona radiata and a smoothly uniform enhancement pattern likely represent a demyelinating plaque (tumefactive multiple sclerosis).
Tumefactive Multiple Sclerosis
• Tumefactive MS
• GBM
• Primary CNS Lymphoma
20 year-old woman with left side upper and lower weakness 3 weeks ago. Now asymptomatic. Seen by hometown ER, CT scan negative. Evaluated by MRI 1 week ago which demonstrated an enhancing brain lesion.  Please reevaluate.
This case is interesting because the follow-up study was performed a week after the initial study, which was 5 weeks earlier than originally planned.  The patient was able to schedule the repeat exam due to an opening in the schedule and did so shortly after the order was submitted.  The dramatic lesion enhancement on the original study has resolved which appears to signal radiographic correlation with resolution of clinical signs and symptoms.
