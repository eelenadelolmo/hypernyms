Stridor
Frontal projection reveals steepling of the glottic airway. Lateral projection with the neck in neutral position shows marked thickening of the prevertebral soft tissues, concerning for retropharyngeal abscess. Repeat lateral view with the neck hyperextended clears the prevertebral soft tissues and reveals classic findings of croup including hypopharyngeal overdistension, thin epiglottis and aryepiglottic folds, fuzziness of the vocal cords, prominence of the laryngeal ventricle and subglottic narrowing
