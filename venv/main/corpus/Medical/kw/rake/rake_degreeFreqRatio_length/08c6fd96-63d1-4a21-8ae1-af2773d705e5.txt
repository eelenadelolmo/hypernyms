• Astrocytoma
• Abscess
• Intramedullary spinal cord metastasis
47 year old woman, previously treated for lung cancer metastatic to brain.
This spinal cord lesion was seen on routine follow up MRI brain study.  This patient was also recently diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer. There was no increased activity of the spinal cord mass on I 131 scan indicating that it likely a metastatic lesion from lung and not thyroid gland.
