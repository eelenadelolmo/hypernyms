Eye examination and confrontational testing revealed a bitemporal hemianopia with an additional superonasal defect in the right eye. OD 20/200, OS 20/20.
Large mass on T1 isointense to gray matter arising from the sella with mass effect on the optic chiasm. Post contrast shows heterogeneous enhancement. No visible pituitary gland seen.
Pituitary Macroadenoma
Differential Diagnosis: Craniopharyngioma, Meningioma, Glioma, Germ Cell tumor, metastatic disease
36 year old latin american male presents with headaches and visual disturbances.
>10mm in size
Less common than pituitary microadenomas
Usually non-functioning
Ages 25-60
Often symptomatic due to mass effect on surrounding structures (Optic chiasm, Cavernus Sinus, 3rd Ventricle)
MR Imaging Characteristics:  Usually isointense to gray matter on all sequences, heterogeneous enhancement post-gad, can contain central areas of necrosis.
Involvement of the cavernus sinus can be difficult to discern.
Although pituitary carcinoma is rare (<1% of adenomas), it cannot be distinguished by imaging alone
