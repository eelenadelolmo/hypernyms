Findings: The head of the fibula and the lateral tibial condyle are clearly separated on the right AP view consistent with dislocation.  Notice the position of the head of the fibula partially overlapping the lateral tibial condyle on the left side comparison. The fibula is fractured on both sides and patient is status post ORIF of tibial fracture on the right. 
This dislocation is probably of the anterolateral variety (most common type), but the anteroposterior direction of the dislocation is not clearly established on available lateral views and CT was not performed.
