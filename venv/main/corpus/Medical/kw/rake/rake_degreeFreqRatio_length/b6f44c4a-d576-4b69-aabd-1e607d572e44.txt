Texto: 
Soft, non-fixed, small nodules palpated in the right and left lobes of the thyroid.  The thyroid does not appear grossly enlarged.  The patient does not report pain in the thyroid.  The patient does not have dry skin or thinning hair.  

Thyroid Function Tests
The patient had blood drawn and thyroid function tests done following the incidental finding of thyroid nodules on MRI.  The findings were within normal limits and are as follows. 

Thyroglobulin Antibody: <20 IU/ml (NL: 0-40)
T4, Free: .78 ng/dl. (NL: .58-1.64)
TSH: 1.28 uIU/ml (NL: .34-5.60)

BMP and GFR also within normal limits.
No treatment necessary.  Patient can be monitored by her primary physician at annual checkup with thyroid palpation, documentation of nodule growth, and TSH studies.  If abnormalities or growth are detected, repeat Fine Needle Aspiration biopsy can be performed.
Current MR Study:
>Incidental nodule present in the right lobe of the the thyroid warranting followup by sonogram.  
>Slight straightening of the normal cervical lordosis C4-C7
>C3-C4: Broad based disc herniation of the protrusion type impinging on the anterior thecal sac.  
>C7-T1: Minimal central disc herniation of the protursion type impinging on the subarachnoid space.  A faint central annular tear is noted.

Followup Ultrasound one month after the accident
>Thyromegaly noted
>Multiple nodules noted.  Larger nodules noted in right lobe with predominantly cystic architecture.  
>No definite suspicious increased vascularity noted within the nodules
>No  lymphadenopathy appreciated within the neck
Right Lobe: Two nodules present.  The larger nodule measures 3.4cm x 1.8 cm x 2.2CM, is sharply defined, and has a mixed echoarchitecture and no calcifications.  The smaller nodule sits inferomedially and measures 1.1cm x .49 cm x .85cm.
Isthmus: Unremarkable
Left Lobe: Six small nodules noted. None contain calcifications. Normal vascularity. Unlikely to be malignant.  


MR Study from MVC seven years prior: 
>C3-C4: Minimal focal central posterior disc bulge/protrusion without impingement on ventral spinal chord
>C4-C5: Large left posterior dis herniation of the extrusion type causing impingement of the left anterolateral spinal chord and narrowing of left neural foramen.
>Disc fusion at C5-C6 level
>Diffuse disc herniation at T4-T5 level
*No hyperdensity appreciated in thyroid gland
Thyroid Cysts
Thyroid cysts
Colloid Thyroid Nodule
Thyroid Carcinoma
Hashimoto's Lymphoma
Subclinical Hypothyroidism
Patient is a 48 year old caucasian female that presents status post MVA six months ago.  She reports that she was in the front seat, passenger side, of a vehicle that had a head on collision with another car.  Both airbags were deployed and the patient was wearing her seatbelt.  She is unsure whether she lost conciousness or not.  She was taken by ambulance to the hospital where she was examined, had radiographs performed, medicated with lortab and released.  
   
The patient underwent MRI studies one month post-MVA .  Incidental finding of thyroid nodules prompted followup investigation using ultrasound and ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy.  
    
The patient has a past medical history of two prior MVCs - seven and nine years earlier.  She has disc pathology in her cervical and lumber spine with significantly restricted cervical range of motion and lower extremity pain.  

The patient also had gastric bypass ione year ago, and lost 100 pounds.  She underwent "female surgery" at the same time as the gastric bypass.  She reports "always feeling cold" for years.  She has no history of thyroid pathology.  The patient takes lortab and skelexin.  The patient has a history of hypertension.  She denies having other chronic medical conditions.

In the journal article Endocr Pract.  2003 Jan-Feb;9(1):5-11 "Discovery of Unsuspected Thyroid Pathologic Conditions After Trauma to the Anterior Neck Area Attributable to a Motor Vehicle Accident: Relation to Use of the Shoulder Harness by Dicky et al, it is understood that impact of the thyroid area to the shoulder harness may result in thyroid nodules or cysts.  In this case we have a patient that had an MRI that pre-dates the MVA without evidence of thyroid cyst.  We have subsequent MRI and Ultrasound studies following the MVA demonstrating thyroid cysts.  Although the correlation is not entirely clear, it is felt consideration should be given to the MVA as a causative factor.   It is also possible that that the cysts pre-existed the MVA and were incidental discoveries on advanced imaging.  As a result, patients such as this one are followed up sonographically, frequently undergo biopsies and possible surgeries. 

It was interesting that the patient had undergone bariatric surgery for weight loss a year ago, one year prior to the discovery of the thyroid cysts.  She also reported always feeling cold.  Her morbid obesity and cold intolerance raised the possibility of hypothyroidism.  However, she did not display most of the classic symptoms of hypothyroidism such as dry skin, constipation, bradycardia, or brittle hair.  Furthermore, her thyroid function tests did not reveal any abnormalities.
