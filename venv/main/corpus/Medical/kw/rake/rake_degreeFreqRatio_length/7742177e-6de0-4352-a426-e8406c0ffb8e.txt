Temp:  100.8
Abd exam: +BS, Soft, -TTP,  No rebound.
Wbc 14.5k
Laboratory follow up after supportive treatment demonstrated normalization of amylase and lipase.
Diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with blurring of margins.
Stranding densities in the surrounding fat and blurring of the fat planes are also noted.
Acute pancreatitis
Multiple etiologies of acute pancreatitis include:
EtOH
Gallstones
Metabolic
Trauma (including iatrogenesis)
Penetrating ulcer
Malignancy
54 year old male with persistent fevers, leukocytosis, and low grade abdominal pain.
While the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is made clinically, in this case, the patient's relatively mild symptoms did not raise suspicion for pancreatitis until after abdominal imaging.  The main role of CT imaging in the setting of pancreatitis is to evaluate for the presence of complications such as pseudocyst or abscess formation, hemorrhage, necrosis, or splenic vein thrombosis. 
Definitive identification of precipitating cause was not identified in the patient. Acute pancreatitis may be considered idiopathic in up to 20% of cases.
