Texto: 
Bilateral hip pain
Patient is continued on medical management and will likely need hip replacements relatively early
Subchondral sclerosis and collapse with cyst formation in both femoral heads.
contour abnormality in both femoral heads (flattening)
AVN
AVN
Active duty man with hip pain.
Evaluation in total joint clinic
report of AVN in both hips
AVN in  a young, active duty male is often associated with steroid use.  Other potential causes in this patient include trauma, infection and caisson dz.  Chronic/inflamatory causes such as sickle cell disease, lupus, Gaucher's dz or radiation therapy are much less likely in a service member on active duty. 

Although cases as advanced as this are clearly visible on plain film, AVN is best evaluated on MR imaging.
