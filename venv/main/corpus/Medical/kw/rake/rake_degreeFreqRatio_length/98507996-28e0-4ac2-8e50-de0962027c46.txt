This resulted in fetal demise from pulmonary hypoplasia.  Shunting of the bladder to the amniotic cavity has been tried in similar cases.
There are bilateral paraspinal cysts in the upper abdomen and a dilated bladder that ascends to the level of the paraspinal cysts.  When coronal oblique imaging is performed through the bladder into the lower pelvis a funneled segment of the lower bladder gives it an overall "key hole" configuration.  Coronal imaging through the 2 upper paraspinal cysts demonstrate them having a rim of soft tissue parenchyma.  No seperate kidneys are identified.
Posterior Urethral Valves
Bladder outlet obstruction
        Posterior urethral valves are most common
        Occasionally a seperate cyst is seen within the bladder (cyst within a cyst) representing a ureterocele from a duplicated collecting system causing bladder outlet obstruction.

Uncommon causes in utero
        penile stenosis
        pelvic mass - 
            sacrococcygeal teratoma - typically large and the majority have an external component posteriorly
