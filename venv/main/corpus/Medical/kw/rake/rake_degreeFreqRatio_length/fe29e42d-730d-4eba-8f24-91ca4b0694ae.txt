Left thigh tender to palpation.
Surgical I&D and IV Antibiotics
Axial T2-weighted fat-saturated MR image demonstrating a rounded high signal lesion in the distal femur with a sinus tract that extends posteriorly through the cortex into the adjacent soft tissues.  There are also multiple irregular high signal collections within the posterior deep soft tissues indicative of abscess formation. Axial T1-weighted post contrast demonstrating a peripheral enhancing low signal lesion within the central medullary cavity of the distal femur.

Metastatic Disease
44-year-old male with a history of a traumatic left femur fracture in 2004 who underwent ORIF at that time.  He was doing well until a year and a half ago when he developed endocarditis with subsequent pain and infection of his left thigh. He had his internal hardware removed at that time and was treated with oral antibiotics for a month. One month ago he developed severe pain in his left extremity to the point where he could no longer walk. He initially presented to an outside facility and was started on IV antibiotics.
