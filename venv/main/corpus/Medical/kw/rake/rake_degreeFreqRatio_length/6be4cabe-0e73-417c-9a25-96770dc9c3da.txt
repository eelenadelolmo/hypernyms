A 9 year old girl presents with abdominal pain and feeding intolerance

This young girl has a a long history of chewing on her dolls’ hair.  The long "tail" of this trichobezoar, extending through three segments of the duodenum, qualifies as a "Rapunzel Syndrome".

Trichobezoars are most common in young females, 13-20 years old, and may be associated with psychiatric problems - especially trichotillomania and trichophagia (eating hair).  Patients may eat their own hair, doll hair, wigs, and occasionally the hair of pets.

NOTE: Compulsive hair pulling is "trichotillomania".
