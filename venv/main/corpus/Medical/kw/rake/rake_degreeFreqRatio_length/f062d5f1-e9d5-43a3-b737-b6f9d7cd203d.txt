Psoriatic Arthritis
History of psoriasis.
Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory, proliferative disease of the skin.  Psoriatic arthritis occurs in 5-8 percent of patients with psoriasis.  The mean age of diagnosis is 40 years and ranges from 20 to 39 years in men and 40 to 59 years in women.  Bone erosion and proliferation can strongly suggest the diagnosis.  Erosions begin in the joint margins and extend along the articular surface or progress away from the joint.  Severe erosions may widen the joint space and lead to a pencil in cup or cup and saucer appearance.  Asymmetric DIP or IP joint involvement and involvement of a few rays are characteristic.
