Ultrasound imaging of the pelvis revealed a complex cystic mass within the left adnexa that measured 9.9 ? 9.8 ? 9.0 cm (Figure 1 ). It contained multiple septations and an echogenic nodule/mass within the left adnexa. The echogenic mass had shadowing suggestive of calcification. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis revealed a 10.0 ? 9.2 ? 8.3 cm mass immediately anterior to the uterus and left ovary. The predominant component was low on T1 and high on T2 weighting, suggesting a cystic component. An irregular solid component within the primarily cystic mass was seen, measuring 4.4 cm in greatest dimension. The preoperative radiologic diagnosis was most likely an ovarian teratoma.
Surgical removal and pathology diagnosis.
No post-surgery therapy.
• Laparoscopy was performed, but the mass was discovered to be too large to remove intact and a laparotomy was performed. At time of surgery, a heterogeneous mass was found attached to the left ovary.

• Specimen radiograph examination revealed a 9.5 ? 5.5 ? 5.5 cm multilocular, thin-walled fluid-filled cyst (Figure 2). The cyst walls were smooth, gelatinous, and uniform throughout with a regular vascular pattern. Adherent to and within the cyst was a 6.5 ? 4.0 ? 3.0 cm fetiform structure covered with a viscous, sebaceous, keratinaceous-like substance (Figure 3) . At its cranial pole was a 1.5 ? 1.0 ? 0.5 cm intact, membranous, clear fluid-filled cyst. Adjacent to the cyst were several thin, long, darkly pigmented hairs measuring 2.0 cm in length. The remainder of the fetiform structure was covered by skin bearing fine lanugo hair. A single rudimentary upper limb bud was present, measuring 1.5 cm in length. At the caudal portion were 2 rudimentary lower limb buds that included feet and toes. These measured 2.2 cm in length each. On the caudal portion cephalic to one of the limb buds was a 0.7 ? 0.7 ? 0.2 cm flesh-colored nodule covered by hair-bearing skin. Bivalving of the specimen revealed soft tan-yellow tissue. Centrally located was a 1.5 ? 0.7 cm bony piece of tissue reminiscent of vertebral column. There was no grossly recognizable ovary, fallopian tube, placenta, or umbilical cord.

• Histologic examination revealed that the cyst walls were composed of a simple serous lining with 1 focus of squamous metaplasia and areas of denuded lining. There was residual ovarian parenchyma. The fetiform structure was covered in integument consisting of normal epidermis, collagen, and subcutaneous fat with underlying well-developed sebaceous and eccrine sweat glands and pilar structures. Tissues derived from ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm were identified. The limb buds and rudimentary digits consisted of rudimentary cartilage surrounded by fat, neurovascular bundles, and minute amounts of skeletal muscle with overlying skin (Figure 4a). An epidermal inclusion cyst was identified. At the base of the skull, normal lamellar bone was present. Cartilage and bone that seemed to represent an immature nasal septum were present. An adjacent cyst was composed of respiratory epithelium, and sinonasal mucosa was present. There was also mature neural tissue present in the cranial pole soft tissue with cerebellar folia (Figure 4b) and choroid plexus. A ciliary body and retina were also identified. Other elements identified in the fetiform structure consisted of mature respiratory epithelium with underlying mucous glands and cartilage (Figure 4c ) and fetal lung parenchyma (Figure 4d), as well as gastrointestinal mucosa (Figure 4e). Thyroid tissue was identified. A representative section of the possible vertebral column demonstrated endochondral ossification with normal bone marrow elements (Figure 4f). No immature elements and no placental membranes were identified.
Fetiform teratoma (homunculus)
• Fetiform teratoma (homunculus)
• Fetus in fetu
A 23-year-old woman, gravida 0, presented initially with a chief complaint of dyspareunia. Her past medical history and surgical history were unremarkable. She had no allergies and was on no medications. Initial physical examination revealed a left adnexal mass.
Mature cystic teratomas are common benign ovarian tumors that occur most commonly in women of reproductive age. The majority are composed of disorganized, neoplastic, mature tissues of 1 or more of the embryonic germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Despite the relatively benign nature of this neoplasm, there continues to be extensive research into this tumor because of its unusual development and fascinating ability to recapitulate any tissue found in the human body. Rarely, these tumors develop a high degree of differentiation and organization resembling a malformed fetus (fetiform structure).

A bony skeleton is typically present with varying degrees of limb formation, but visceral organ tissue and skeletal muscle are generally inconspicuous or absent. Ovarian teratomas are thought to arise from parthenogenetic development of a primordial germ cell. They demonstrated that teratomas are always homozygous, while normal tissues are heterozygous for chromosomal polymorphisms at or near the centromere. The authors concluded that mature cystic teratomas arise from a single germ cell that has completed the first meiotic division. Further support for this theory is that the anatomic distribution of this neoplasm is along the primordial germ line, and the age distribution is typically reproductive age.

This entity needs to be distinguished from fetus in fetu. Fetus in fetu is a term first coined by Merkel in the 1800s. It is a very rare congenital anomaly in which there is unequal division of totipotential cells of a blastocyst with the inclusion of these cells into the more mature embryo and is a form of a monozygotic diamnionic monochorionic twin pregnancy where the parasitic twin grows inside the body of its partner. The pathogenesis of this lesion is thought to be a consequence of embryonic duplication with anomalous inclusion of 1 twin in the body of a host twin occurring after anastomosis of the vitelline circulation, allowing 1 twin to parasitize the other. Fetus in fetu has classically been distinguished from teratoma in that the diagnosis of the former requires the presence of a highly developed and segmented axial skeleton. This distinction is somewhat arbitrary but is based on the hypothesis that an axial skeleton implies development past the primitive streak stage, a stage thought to be too developed for teratoma. Interestingly, fetus in fetu almost always presents with acardia and anencephaly. In contrast, fetiform teratoma usually does not have complex, well-developed organs. 

It has been proposed that fetiform teratoma and fetus in fetu can be differentiated based on zygosity. As previously mentioned, most ovarian teratomas are homozygous at loci where the host normal tissue demonstrates heterozygosity, but fetus in fetu is genetically identical to its host. Cytogenetic examination was not performed on this case.

Clinically, ovarian fetiform teratomas and fetus in fetu present differently. Most reported cases of the latter have been discovered in infancy as an abdominal mass, and no case has been reported within an ovary. The most common location is retroperitoneal, although cases have been reported in the skull, sacrum, mouth, and scrotum as well. In contrast, fetiform teratomas are most commonly found in women of reproductive age and discovered as ovarian masses.

Fetiform teratomas must also be distinguished from ectopic pregnancies. All reported cases of fetiform teratoma are composed of mature tissue and present without placental or trophoblastic tissue.
