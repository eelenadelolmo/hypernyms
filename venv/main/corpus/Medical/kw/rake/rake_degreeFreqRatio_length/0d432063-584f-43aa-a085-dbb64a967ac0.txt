Patients with ADPCKD need close followup for treatment of hypertension and continual assessement of renal function.  Symptoms of urinary tract infection (which are common in patients with ADPCKD) should be treated promptly with appropriate antibiotics to preserve as much renal function as possible.

Genotyping, genetic testing of relatives, and fetal ultrasound can help predict or rule out the disease in ohter family members.

Preevaluation for renal transplantation before it becomes necessary.

Symptomatic cysts can be treated surgically or with a combination of percutaneous drainage and dehydrated ETOH ablation therapy.
Multiple hyoechoic cysts of many different sizes are seen in both the renal and hepatic parenchyma.
