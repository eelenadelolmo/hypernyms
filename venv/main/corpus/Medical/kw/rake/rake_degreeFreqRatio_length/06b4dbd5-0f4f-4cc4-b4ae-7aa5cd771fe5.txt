Per endocrine
Enlargement of the inferior, medial and superior recti with sparing of the tendons.  Symmetric bilateral prominent proptosis.  Optic nerves are normal.  No retrobulbar mass or fatty infiltration.  Prominent maxillary sinus mucosal thickening with extension into the ethmoid air cells and frontal sinuses with obstruction of the infundibula.
Graves Ophthalmopathy
Thyroid opthalmopathy, acromegaly, pseudotumor, infection, plasma cell granuloma, sarcoid, TB, lymphoma, leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, metastatic, carotid cavernous fistula, extradural arteriovenous fistula, amyloid
painless proptosis
Top considerations being pseudotumor and graves.

Orbital pseudotumor: Unilateral 85%, Involves tendon, ill defined margins, Inflammation of fat, enlarged lacrimal gland, good response to steroids, painful and therefore not the diagnosis.

Graves Disease: 
Graves’ ophthalmopathy develops in most patients with Graves’ disease, and is the most common orbital disorder in US population causing most unilateral and bilateral exophthalmos in adults, 80% of bilateral, 15-28% of unilateral cases. Orbital disease usually follows hormonal changes but may be first sign of Graves.  It is more common in females but worse clinical course in males and older age.

Painless proptosis; double vision, and periorbital swelling and chemosis are common.

Werner’s Modified Staging System for Thyroid Orbitopathy
•	Grade1: Asymptomatic, lid retraction, stare, lid lag (spasm of upper lid due to thyrotoxicosis)
•	Grade 2: symptomatic eyelid retraction, soft tissue involvement
•	Grade 3: proptosis as determined by exophthalmometer measurement >22mm, without diplopia
•	Grade 4: proptosis > 22mm with diplopia, extraocular muscle involvement; affects muscles at midpoint
•	Grade 5: corneal involvement (ulceration)
•	Grade 6: optic nerve involvement: loss of vision
It resolves spontaneously in more than 90% of cases with the remaining developing eye complications.  Treatment: head elevation at night, lubricating eyedrops, ointments&#8594; steroids/radiation therapy &#8594; immunosuppressives, surgery. 

Pathophysiology: Enlargement of EOM: 3 basic mechanisms: infiltration by abnormal cells, deposition of abnormal material (amyloid, mucopolysaccharides), or edema from vascular congestion. Degree of orbital involvement does not correlate with degree of thyroid dysfunction or levels of circulating autoantibodies.
	Inflammatory leukocytic infiltration with edema and deposition of mucopolysaccharides in the orbital contents, predominantly involving the EOMs and retrobulbar fat.  Thought to be autoimmune due to cross-reactivity between eye muscle and thyroid autoantigens.  Autoantibodies implicated include: long acting thyroid stimulating factor (LATS) and thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI), and circulating autoantibodies against a human eye muscle soluble antigen.
	Early acute inflammatory stage involves deposition of hygroscopic mucopolysaccharides and glycoproteins with infiltration by inflammatory cells.  
	Disease progression results in replacement by collagenous tissue, necrosis of muscle fibers and fatty degeneration, which results from chronic increase in orbital pressure leading to ischemia, edema, and fibrosis of muscles.  The fibrotic phase is irreversible.  
	Proptosis: enlargement of EOMs, edema, increased volume of retrobulbar fat, vascular congestion, and corneal ulcers. Degree of proptosis is measured in axial plane at level of lens from interzygomatic line to anterior margin of globe.
	Compression on optic nerve may result in ischemia and optic neuropathy.

Imaging:
Muscle involvement: most common structures affected, most often affects the medial and inferior recti “I’M SLow” Normal recti muscle belly diameter is 3 mm. Often bilateral, symmetrical 85%. Isolated involvement of single muscle 10% usually superior rectus and levator palpebrae complex. Classically swelling is maximal in belly, sparing tendinous attachments, and margins of muscles are smooth.  

Other imaging findings are increased amount of retro-ocular fat, stranding of the intraconal fat, enlarged lacrimal gland, stretching of the optic nerve, and increased diameter of optic nerve sheath due to CSF trapping in subarachnoid space.

MR: muscles may be thick and of high signal intensity on T2WI, reflecting edema.  Tram track sign on T2W is suspicious for optic nerve compression and represents dilatation of subarachnoid space surrounding the optic nerve (ddx for this sign: increased intracranial pressure and pseudotumor cerebri).
