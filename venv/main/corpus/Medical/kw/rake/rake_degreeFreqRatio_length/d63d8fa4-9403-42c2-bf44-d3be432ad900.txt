Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is a Salter Harris Type 1 fracture. This is typically seen in obese adolescent boys and is more common in African Americans.  It is more common on the left side but may be bilateral in up to 10 to 20 percent of patients.  Because of normal musculature, the femoral neck moves anterior and superolaterally resulting in posterior and inferomedial rotation of the epiphysis.  You'll typically see height loss in the affected epiphysis with a widening of the growth plate.  Because the slippage of the epiphysis initially more posterior than medial, early findings are more apparent on the frogleg or lateral view.  Frogleg views usually offer a better image than lateral views. Treatment consists of pinning in place, however in acute or severe cases they may have to use a closed reduction technique.  Complications include avascular necrosis, chondrolysis, varus deformities and degenerative osteoarthritis.
