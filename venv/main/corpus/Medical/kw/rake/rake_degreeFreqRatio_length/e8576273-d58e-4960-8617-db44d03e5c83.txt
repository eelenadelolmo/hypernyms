There is abnormal signal in the L3 vertebral body, which is associated with mild compression fracture deformity. There is extensive involvement of the soft tissue with expansion into the anterior soft tissues.

The most frequent site of metastatic disase to the spine is to the highly vascular bone marrow of vertebral bodies. Vertebral body metastases will often spread into the region of the pedicle and posterior elements. 

Initially, fatty marrow is replaced with tumor cells. The normal high intensity on T1WI from fatty marrow is replaced by a lower signal intensity. Soon after there is loss of the bony trabeculae, most often without periosteal reaction. On postcontrast T1 tumor within the vertebral body enhances.
