A large amount of residual gastric contents on EGD.
Medications can be used to enhance gastric emptying such as metoclopromide, domperidone, cisapride, or erythromycin.  Because the higher osmolality meals slow gastric emptying, efforts to reduce meal osmolality are also helpful.
Radiologic findings: This patient has gastroparesis since 93% of the radiolabeled meal remains in the stomach at 90 minutes (normal value in our laboratory is less than 50% retention of the radiolabeled meal at 90 minutes).
Gastroparesis
none
38 year old male patient, who had a partial gastrectomy for a gastrointestinal stromal tumor, presents with regurgitation.
This particular study was obtained on a single-headed camera rather than a dual-headed camera, which is normally used for gastric emptying studies in our clinic.  In order to obtain the most accurately quantitative value for gastric emptying, the study should be obtained by acquiring both anterior and posterior images of the stomach using a dual-headed camera, and a correction for attenuation using the geometric mean method should be used since the ingested meal moves from the fundus (relatively posterior) to the antrum (more anterior), which results in variable detection efficiency of the radiolabeled meal by the gamma camera.  Alternatively, as in this case, a single-headed camera may be utilized for acquiring the patient's abdomen in the left anterior oblique (LAO) projection in order to minimize the effect of the attenuation.  The result obtained in this case, although not quite as quantitatively accurate, is unquestionably abnormal as 93% of radiolabeled meal remains in the stomach after 90 minutes (normal is less than 50% retention of radiolabeled meal at 90 minutes).
