presents for evaluation of pulsatile mass.
This case demonstrates a common finding--thrombus calcification--that although it may crescentic in shape, should not be confused with the high density crescent sign of impending rupture.  

     Since the patients aneurysm was less than 5 cm, the patient was treated medically and followed with yearly CT scans.
