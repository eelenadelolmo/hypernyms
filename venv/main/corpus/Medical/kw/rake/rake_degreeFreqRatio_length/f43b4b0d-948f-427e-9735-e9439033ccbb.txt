pulsatile abdominal mass.
Yearly CT scans of Aorta.
Partially calcified mural thrombus with increase in diameter of abdominal aorta.  Crescent of calcification within mural thrombus.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm
presents for evaluation of pulsatile mass.
This case demonstrates a common finding--thrombus calcification--that although it may crescentic in shape, should not be confused with the high density crescent sign of impending rupture.  

     Since the patients aneurysm was less than 5 cm, the patient was treated medically and followed with yearly CT scans.
