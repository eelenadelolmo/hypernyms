Over the course of the month, prior to the most current presentation, the patient was treated for constipation a few times as well as a UTI (based on an earlier U/A). Once the diagnosis was established with the current presentation the patient underwent right salpingo-oophorectomy, did well and was discharged home a few days after the surgery.
Contrast enhanced abdominal/pelvic CT with oral and rectal contrast performed first: Approximately 8 cm hetergeneous but predominantly low attenuation midline pelvic mass with multiple peripheral peripherally enhancing cysts or follicles. Anterior and rightward uterine deviation.
Normal left ovary. Normal appendix.

Limited transabdominal pelvic ultrasound performed next: Large midline hyperechoic pelvic mass with peripherally located cysts/follicles. Venous and arterial Doppler waveforms absent.
Ovarian Torsion
CT: ovarian torsion, ovarian/adnexal mass with or without torsion.

Ultrasound: ovarian torsion
10 year old girl with intermittent lower abdominal pain for approximately one month now presents with severe lower abdominal pain, anorexia and some vomitting. No fever.

The patient was premenarchal and not sexually active.
This patient was likely experiencing intermittent torsion over the course of a month and experiencing intermittent nonspecific symptoms until the diagnosis was established at her most recent presentation when the CT was performed to evaluate for appendicitis.
