Texto: 
Profound metabolic acidosis, depressed mental status, and bilateral ("cortical") blindness.
Methanol toxicity is related to its metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase, producing formic acid and formaldehyde.    The patient was treated with IV Ethanol and dialysis. Ethanol is a metabolic competitor for alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver and may slow the formation of the toxic products.  
NOTE: This patient was treated prior to the availability of fomepizole (Antizol®).

Bilateral abnormal hyperintensity in the lateral lenticular nuclei (putamen).
Methanol intoxication, putamen infarction
Bilateral symmetric BG lesions suggest aToxic-metabolic insult:
poisoning
organic alcohol (methanol, ethylene glycol, etc.)
hypoxia
hypoglycemia
non-ketotic hyperglycemia
42 y.o. alcoholic man who works as a carpenter, found down in his workshop on Monday morning.
As a carpenter, this unfortunate patient might have ingested methanol - which is a common (but toxic) solvent used to dilute shellac for finishing wood cabinets.  The mechanism of blindness is usually attributed to primary damage to the optic nerve and retina.
