Texto: 
Weakness of the entire face (upper and lower) on the right. 
Dysphagia. Keratitis of the Right eye.
Neurosurgery was consulted, and she subsequently underwent a craniotomy with CPA mass resection
CT Findings: Slightly heterogeneously hypodense mass measuring 4.0 cm x 2.7 cm involving the anterior aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere causing displacement and partial obliteration of the fourth ventricle. The mass shows punctate calcifications. The mass shows surrounding vasogenic edema and mass-effect on the brainstem. Midline shift to the left of 7 mm.

MR Findings: 4.1 x 3.7 cm extra-axial posterior fossa mass near the cerebellopontine angle produces significant mass-effect on the brainstem to the left. The fourth ventricle is effaced and obstructive hydrocephalus is present. There is is abnormal enhancement in the right internal auditory canal although there is no expansion of the internal auditory canal. Enhancement is somewhat heterogeneous and there are small cystic areas within the tumor. There is no increased signal on T1. No restricted diffusion associated with tumor.
