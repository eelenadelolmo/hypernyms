>> Tenderness in the left lower quadrant and a partially mobile mass extending toward the pelvis were found on physical examination. 

>> On rectal examination, the rectum was empty, but blood was noticed on the examining finger.

>> Slightly distended abdomen.

>> Elevated white blood cell count with left shift.

>> Metabolic alkalosis.
The patient was kept in the hospital pediatric in-patient unit and made a full recovery in three days.
Axial CT images demonstrate a mass in the left lower quadrant within the descending colon. This mass had a targetoid appearance and did not allow enteric ontrast to freely pass: consistent with the "Target Sign" of intussuscepting bowel. In this case a proximal portion of colon (the intussusceptum) had herniated into a distal portion of colon (the intussuscipiens). There was also a soft tissue mass surrounded by a crescent of gas in the left lower quadrant.
