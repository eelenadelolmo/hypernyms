CXR:  
The frontal projection demonstrates relics of previous pulmonary
disease including plate-like atelectasis in the right upper and lower lung
zones, and also in the left lower lung zones.  There is a superimposed
density on the right side which does not appear to represent the right diaphragm since
this margin is visualized.  The right hemidiaphragmatic mass is noted
posteriorly, but not seen anteriorly, suggesting that the density noted
anteriorly on the lateral projection and also overlying the right
hemidiaphragmatic margin  on the frontal projection probably represents
anterior eventration of the right hemidiaphragm.  
 

Impression: 
 1.     THERE IS THE SUGGESTION OF ANTERIOR EVENTRATION OF THE RIGHT HEMIDIAPHRAGM.  
 
MRI:  Sagittal gradient echo T2-weighted images, demonstrate fatty mass adjacent to the heart with direct connection to the abdominal omentum.

CT:  Axial imaging demonstrates a fatty mass adjacent to the right border with multiple linear densities consistent with vessels.

Foramen of Morgagni hernias are herniations of abdominal contents through the anterior medial diaphragmatic foramen of Morgagni.  This is herniation through the sternalcostal trigone due to failed fusion of the sternal and costal fibrotendinous elements of the diaphragm. This typically results in a Cardiophrenic angle mass most commonly seen on the right side.  These herniations most commonly contain omentum but may also contain liver or colon.  When they contain only omentum they'll have the appearance of lipoma on CT and omental vessels will be visible within the fat.  These asymptomatic hernias are associated with obesity and are covered by both peritoneum and parietal pleura.
