The cervix on physical exam was extremely stenotic.  However, with gentle dilation a HSG catheter was able to be passed.
The patient was referred to fertility clinic to discuss further evaluation.
The endocervical canal was long and narrow.  The uterine cavity was noted to be hypoplastic and associated with a shortened upper uterine segment.  There was a T-shaped configuration to the uterus.  The left fallopian tube was not patent and was associated with hydrosalpinx.  The right fallopian tube demonstrated normal filling and free spillage of contrast into the pelvis.
Hypoplastic uterus with T- shaped uterine contour

DES exposure in utero
Intrauterine adhesions
endometrial infections
22 year old female who presented with a one year history of infertility.  Her past medical history is significant for regular painful menses since approximately 15 years old.  She had had an ectopic pregnancy in the refion of her left ovary which was removed approximately one year prior to presentation.
DES is a synthetic estrogen used in the 1940's and 1950's.  This patient was born in 1982 and therefore was unlikely to have been exposed to this specific agent.  However, the radiographic appearance of the uterus as well as the clinical picture of ectopic pregnancy and infertility mirror those found in DES exposed fetus.  This patient's mother took several medications while pregnant and this may have contributed to the abnormalities noted on exam.
