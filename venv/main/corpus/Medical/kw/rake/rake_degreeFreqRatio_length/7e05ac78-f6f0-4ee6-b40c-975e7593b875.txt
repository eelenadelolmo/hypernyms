Following dose of 12.0 mCi F-18 FDG, standard whole body positron emission tomography was performed, including a "non-dedicated" image of the brain. Selected coronal and axial PET images of the brain demonstrate markedly decreased right cerebral metabolism most marked in the right parietal lobe, as well as decreased contralateral cerebellar activity.
