jaundice
elevated bilirubin
Sphincterotomy and stent placement
ERCP spot radiograph demonstrates dilatation and stricturing of portions of the extrahepatic and intrahepatic biliary tree.
MRCP similarly demonstrates irregularity of the biliary tree. The intrahepatic involvement is primarily limited to the left lobe.

recurrent pruritis, hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice
PSC is most often associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Although this patient had not been diagnosed with IBD at the time of the biliary findings, a colonoscopy and biopsy were performed to further investigate.  Direct visualization and biopsy of the colon demonstrated ulcerative colitis.
