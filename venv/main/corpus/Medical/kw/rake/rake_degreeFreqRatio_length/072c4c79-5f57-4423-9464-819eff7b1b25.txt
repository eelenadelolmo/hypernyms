â€¢ Ring Enhancing lesion right occipital lobe.
â€¢ Moderate associated vasogenic edema.
â€¢ Increased signal on DWI images with corresponding low signal on ADC map.
Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Lung
â€¢ Abscess
â€¢ Lymphoma
â€¢ Glioma (Astrocytoma WHO 4)
â€¢ Metastasis
77 year old woman with known small cell adenocarcinoma of the lung presents with headache and visual disturbances
The MRI of this lesion mimicked an abscess because of the ring enhancement with restricted diffusion and low signal changes on the ADC map.
