Pre-operative chemotherapy
Multiple nephrogenic rests, variable in size, in bilateral kidneys with characteristic homogeneous, hypodensity after contrast administration.
The predominant mass however involving the upper pole of the left kidney demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement consistent with a Wilm's Tumor.
Also on the third image, there is an enhancing para-aortic mass that likely represents metastatic lymphadenopathy.
