Texto: 
T6 sensory level.
Lower extremity weakness and hyper-reflexia.
Negative laboratory (including CSF evaluation for MS)
Surgery contemplated if symptoms progress.
MRI-- Focal deformity of spinal cord at T3-4
Preservation of flow voids behind cord at same level
No pathological enhancement.

CT Myelogram-- No mass behind cord.  Rapid filling of posterior subarachnoid space with contrast.
Transdural spinal cord herniation
• Arachnoid cyst
• Focal Cord atrophy
59 year old woman with back pain and bowel and bladder incontinence.  Had MRI ordered to rule out transverse myelitis or MS
Patient had a punctate focus of elevated T2 SI at C3.
Significance is not known at this time
