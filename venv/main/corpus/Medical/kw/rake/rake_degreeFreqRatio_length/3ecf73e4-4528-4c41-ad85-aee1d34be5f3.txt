Texto: 
The patient is undergoing an extensive work-up to rule out clotting disorders or malignant reasons for the portal vein thrombosis.
Intraluminal filling defect within the portal vein, which persisted on all phases of imaging.
Large amount of free abdominal fluid (ascites).
Lobular, shrunken liver - consistent with cirrhosis.
Portal hypertension secondary to portal vein thrombosis
50yo man with Hepatitis C who has developed increasing abdominal girth and early satiety.
This case demonstrates an important radiographic finding which accounts for the patient's symptoms, though it creates a new question (why is he developing thrombi, when his cirrhosis is not to the point of collateralization) as well as answers an old one (the reason for the ascites).
