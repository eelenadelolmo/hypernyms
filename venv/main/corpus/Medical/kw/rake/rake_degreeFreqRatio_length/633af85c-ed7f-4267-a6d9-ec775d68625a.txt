Texto: 
Physical examination demonstrated right-sided sixth nerve palsy. The remainder of the exam was within normal limits.
Because the lesion abutted the posterior wall of the sphenoid sinus, it was possible to perform an image-guided endoscopic procedure through the paranasal sinuses to drain it.
Abnormal hyperintense lesion in the far anterior petrous apex on the patient's right.
Sharply marginated
Cholesterol granuloma of the right petrous apex.
• Normal petrous fatty bone marrow
• Cholesterol granuloma
• Endolymphatic sac tumor
A 13-year-old girl presented with a 2-month history of intermittent right-sided headaches and diplopia. She described mild dysequilibrium but no hearing loss and had no
The traditional approach to this lesion has been through craniotomy or by an approach though the mastoid process.  Approaching the lesion through the paranasal sinuses is less invasive and has the added benefit of facilitating followup; the cyst cavity can be inspected endoscopicaly.
