normal triple screen
There is severe hydronephrosis noted of the left kidney on axial image.  On sagital imaging of the left kidney, this is seen to primarily only involve the upper portion of the kidney.  Mild pelviectasis is noted on the right, within normal limits (<4mm).
Imaging of the bladder demonstrates an eccentrically located thin wall cyst at the inferior aspect of the bladder along the left lateral posterior wall.
