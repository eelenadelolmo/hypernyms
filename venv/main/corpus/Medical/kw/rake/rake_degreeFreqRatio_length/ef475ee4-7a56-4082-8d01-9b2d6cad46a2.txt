Contrast enhanced CT demonstrates a large mass in the left pelvis which extends through the left superior ramus and extends into the proximal left thigh.  The superior pubic ramus is architecturally distorted with cortical disruption and expansion. The mass retains a fat plane between the abdominal and pelvic organs, including the bowel and bladder.

1 year old male who had a semi-firm left groin mass noted by his parents.  Otherwise, parents had noted nothing out of the ordinary. An ultrasound exam (not shown) demonstrated normal testes bilaterally but a mass in the left groin whose origin could not be determined.  A CT was performed for further evaluation.
