Lower extremity bowing.
Labs:
Calcidiol: 5.5 (<10 deficient)    Ca: 9.5 (N: 8-10)
PTH: 148 (N: 15-65)                 Alk Phos: 854 (N: 38-126)
PO4: 2.8  (N: 2.5-4.5)               Fe panel was normal.
Most patients respond well to enteral viatamin D as nutritional deficiency of this fat-soluble vitamin is by far the most common cause for rickets. 

Follow-up radiographs may be obtained in 3-6 weeks to demonstrate calcium deposition along the zone of peripheral calcification seen radiographically as dense metaphysis.
Bowing of the distal femur. 
Metaphysial splaying and fraying especially at the distal femur and to lesser extent at the proximal tibial and fibular metaphysis. Also, there is apparent widening of the physis due to lack of calcium deposition in the zone of provisional calcification.
Nutritional Rickets.
• Rickets
• Hypophosphatasia
• Chronic stress (in the wrists of young gymnasts)
• Copper deficiency
15 month old boy with lower extremity bowing and history of poor diet.
