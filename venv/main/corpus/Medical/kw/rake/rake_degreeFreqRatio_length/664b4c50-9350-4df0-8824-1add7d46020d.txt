No treatment necessary.  No follow-up exam necessary.
Axial CT images of the subdiaphragmatic inferior vena cava show a well-defined, round focus of fat attenuation (-80 HU) initially presumed to be contained within the lumen of the IVC.  However, subsequent multiplanar reformatted images revealed that this “lipoma of the IVC” was actually an extraluminal fat collection medial to the IVC.
Juxtacaval fat collection
1.  Juxtacaval fat collection (often misinterpreted as a “lipoma of the IVC”)
2.  Intracaval spread of renal angiomyolipoma
3.  Juxtacaval fat herniation into the IVC following traumatic caval tear
62 year-old female with a prior ultrasound showing a “mass” at the right hepatic lobe.  Three phase liver CT was recommended for further evaluation.  CT revealed an incidental finding as well as a hemangioma at the posterior segment of the right hepatic lobe.  The incidental finding is the topic of this teaching case.
Please see factoid.
