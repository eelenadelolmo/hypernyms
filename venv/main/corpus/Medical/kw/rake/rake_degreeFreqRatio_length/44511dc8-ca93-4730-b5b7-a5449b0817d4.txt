Newborn female who was transferred from a local hospital because a prenatal ultrasound showed hydrocephalus and a mass.
Congenital brain tumors are rare with GBM accounting for a minority of them.  The most common congenital brain tumors are teratoma, PNET (incl. medulloblastoma), astrocytoma (incl. GBM), and choroid plexus papilloma. PMID: 2167004

Glioblastomas are most commonly diagnosed in middle aged to older adults.
