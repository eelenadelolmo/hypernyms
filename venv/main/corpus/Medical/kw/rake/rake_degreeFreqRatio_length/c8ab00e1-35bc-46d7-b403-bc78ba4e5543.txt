No evidence of PE. There is a mixed density lesion at the level of the pulmonic valve seen on 3 contiguous slices that appeared to arise from cusps of the pulmonic valve.
Pulmonary valve Artifact
vegetation, air embolus, tumor embolus
34 y/o female with chest pain presented from ER for rule out pulmonary embolus.
In retrospect, the "lesion" should have been identified as iatrogenic as it was a combination of air and contrast density. This was originally thought to be fat and calcium.
