Axial FLAIR, T1, and T2 MR images through the brain demonstrate mixed high and low T1 signal abnormalities in the dentate nuclei of the cerebellum, caudate nuclei, pallidum and thalami.  These lesions are fairly symmetric, and correspond to  areas of calcification seen on previous CT.

Fahr disease, or cerebrovascular ferrocalcinosis, is an uncommon disorder characterized by extensive basal ganglia calcification, and includes familial and idiopathic forms.  In this case, MR images of this patient are submitted to supplement an earlier submission of CT images from the same patient.
