Thin older man.
Bone scan (T99m-MDP): Mutlifocal nodular areas of increased uptake throughout the skeleton.

Quadramet (Samarium-153): Given to treat bone pain. The images were acquired approximately 10 minutes after injection of the radiotracer.  Although quadramet is rarely used as a diagnostic agent, it does give off gamma radiation that can be imaged. In this case, the findings are very similar to those seen on the bone scan.
Bone metastasis, secondary to prostate cancer.
Metastatic disease
Sclerotic multiple myleoma
Extreme diffuse bone pain.
