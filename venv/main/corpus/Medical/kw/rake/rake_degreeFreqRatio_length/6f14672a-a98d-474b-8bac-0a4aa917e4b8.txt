MRI brain-There are multiple intra-axial lesions that demonstrate abnormal signal intensity with diffuse enhancement.  The largest lesion is at the gray/white matter junction in the right temporal lobe measuring 15 mm with surrounding vasogenic edema.  There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus.
CT thorax-Soft tissue mass lesion within the anterior aspect of the right lower lobe adjacent to right hilum, consistent with primary lung carcinoma.  There are associated right lower lobe nodules as well as right hilar adenopathy, suspicious for metastatic disease.
High grade adenocarcinoma, primary lung with metastasis to brain
MRI brain:
1. metastatic disease
2. infectious process
3. granulomatous process
CT thorax
1. primary lung carcinoma
2. infectious process
Patient presents to the ED complaining of severe headaches for 3 days.  The patient has no significant medical history but has a 10 pack year history of smoking.
Growth of the tumors has been stabilized with treatment.
