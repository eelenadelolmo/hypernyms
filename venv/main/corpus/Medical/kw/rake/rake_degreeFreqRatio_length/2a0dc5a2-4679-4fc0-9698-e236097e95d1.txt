Slightly antalgic gait.  No evidence of leg length discrepancy.  Afebrile.
Compression-side femoral neck stress fractures are often treated conservatively with a non-weight-bearing regimen.  This case was managed surgically with femoral neck screws.
Nuclear medicine skeletal scintigraphy with Tc-99m MDP demonstrates focal intense activity at the inferomedial aspect of the base of the right femoral neck.

Preoperative plain radiographs demonstrate a 1.6 cm sclerotic line at the compressive (inferior) aspect of the right femoral neck.

MRI of the right hip demonstrates a hypointense fracture line through the compressive (inferior) aspect of the femoral neck without significant periosteal reaction.  Extensive bone marrow edema is seen adjacent to the fracture.

Postoperative plain radiographs demonstrate interval placement of three right femoral neck screws.
Femoral Neck Stress Fracture - Acute
Femoral Neck Stress Fracture - Acute
Nineteen-year-old female presents with right hip pain first noticed approximately three weeks ago.  She explains that she is currently in a training environment that requires daily physical exercise.  No specific trauma.
None.
