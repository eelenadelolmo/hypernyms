Texto: 
Edematous and ecchymotic right hand with tenderness to palpation of the distal hypothenar eminence.
This lesion requires reduction when displaced and immobilization in a splint.  Indications for internal fixation are excessive rotational deformity (resulting in digital scissoring) and excessive apex dorsal angulation (up to 40 degrees is acceptable in the fifth metacarpal).
Plain radiographic images of the right hand demonstrate a transverse fifth metacarpal neck fracture with palmar angulation (dorsolateral apex) and adjacent soft tissue edema.
