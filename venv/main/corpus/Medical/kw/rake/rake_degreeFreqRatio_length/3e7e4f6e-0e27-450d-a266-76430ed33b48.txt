Exaggerated reflexes.  Negative Babinski.  No evidence of any neurocutaneous markers. Remainder of physical exam within normal limits.
pH 7.34 
PCO2 46
HCO3 24.7
Glucose elevated to 230 but otherwise normal BMP
WBC elevated to 18.9 but otherwise normal CBC
Antiepileptic medication and close follow up with neurology.  Periodic MR imaging and EEG were conducted as well.
Abnormal signal intensity in the medial aspect of the right temporal lobe present on all sequences except T1.  Area of abnormality is present on diffusion weighted images as well.  Temporal horn enlargement on right.
Mesial Temporal Sclerosis
• Encephalitis
• Tumor (low-grade astrocytoma, ganglioglioma, etc.)
• Inflammatory changes
• Mesial Temporal Sclerosis (should have atrophy)
• Seizure induced signal change (should resolve)
11 y.o. girl with vomiting, headache, "seizures", and progressive myalgia over the past 2 days.  Patient’s father reports a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit and she was described as unresponsive with eyes deviated to the left while she was lying on the couch.  

Seizure activity (shaking) was described as beginning in both upper extremities - then progressed to involve both lower extremities.

No significant past medical history.
Febrile seizures usually occur with a rapid rise in body temperature and a high fever (> 104 F).

This patient has done well with anticonvulsant therapy.
