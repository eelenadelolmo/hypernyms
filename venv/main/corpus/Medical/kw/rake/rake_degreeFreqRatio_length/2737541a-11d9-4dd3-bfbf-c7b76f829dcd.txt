Texto: 
Patient has tenderness and mass distal to quadriceps.  Mass has decreased in size.  However, swelling has occured on both sides of his right knee.  The area is still painful and mildly tender.  Patient is unable to flex his knee more than ninety degrees.

There was no laboratory data.
Patient is to have a CT scan for baseline and to confirm the diagnosis, and to assess evolution of the lesion.
Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs show feathery calcified/ossified density seen within the soft tissue adjacent to the the mid-femur.  The lesion has a lucent central area with a calcific rim, which is characteristic of myositis ossificans.  There is also a clear zone between the density and the adjacent cortex.  This is also an important distinguishing feature of myositis ossificans.  A parosteal osteosarcoma will typically be more calcified centrally, and will have a connection to hte underlying bone.

Myositis ossificans
15 year old white male with injury to right thigh approximately one month prior to image.
A history of trauma is obtained in sixty to seventy-five percent of patients presenting with myositis ossificans, .  Myositis ossificans usually appears in adolescents, and  commonly occurs in areas most susceptible to injury such as the elbow, thigh, and buttocks.  The lesion is characterized by a lucent center with a calcific rim- a zonal pattern, as well as, separation of the lesion from the adjacent cortex.  

The radiographic appearance of myositis ossificans is also dependent upon the stage of lesion progression.  This patient presented at approximately four-weeks post injury, which corresponds to a mature myositis ossificans with the typical zonal pattern.  Calcifications is expected to be apparent at 4 to 6 weeks after the onset of the lesion.  Initial radiographs may only show soft tissue swelling.  The lesion can be expected to mature and may partially be resorbed over the course of several months.
