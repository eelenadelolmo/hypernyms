1.) Bilateral Lower Extremity Radiograph:
Diffuse osteopenia is evident in the diaphyses of the long bones. Widening and lengthening of the growth plates are evident in the distal femur and proximal tibia. Irregular and indistinct ("fraying") metaphyseal margins of the distal femur and proximal tibia. Bowing of the femur and tibia.

2.) PA/LAT CXR:
Diffuse osteopenia. Irregular metaphyseal border of proximal humerus. Prominence of the growth plates at the costochondral junction of the inferior ribs, or "Rachitic Rosary".
Dietary (Vitamin D deficient) Rickets
1yo African-American male who presented to the Pediatrics clinic with the chief complaint of short stature/failure to thrive. The patient is from a northern, urban setting. His nutrition consisted solely of breast milk without any additional vitamin supplementation for either patient or mom. Mom drinks non- fortified milk.
Rickets is a general medical term used to describe the histopathological and radiological changes that result from a diverse group of disorders with the final common pathway being the loss of orderly maturation and mineralization of cartilage cells at the growth plate. It is characterized by excessive amounts of undermineralized bone matrix. Simply, it represents osteomalacia in the growing skeleton.

The differential diagnosis for disorders of bone mineralization which would result in a rachitic or osteopenic radiologic picture is wide. However the majority of disorders resulting in Rickets are a result of a relative or absolute deficiency of Vitamin D. This deficiency results in the failure to transform growing cartilage into mineralized bone.
The most likely etiology in this case is dietary rickets. Dietary deficiency of Vitamin D can result from prematurity, hyperalimentation, prolonged nonsupplemented breastfeeding, starvation, and an unusual diet. Dietary rickets usually develops at 3-6 months of age. It can present in neonatal age group, especially if premature, and is rarely diagnosed later than 2 years. It is particularly prevalent in dark-skinned infants and children who have little exposure to sunlight and ingest a diet low in Vitamin D without vitamin supplementation. An example of a diet low in Vitamin D includes the infant who is solely breast fed by a mother who is a vegetarian, poorly nourished, or takes in little or no milk, eggs, meat, or fish. Inadequate exposure to sunlight results in the need for additional Vitamin D to be present in the diet.

Clinical features of Rickets include enlarged and distorted bones (bowing), muscle weakness, chest deformities (Pectus carinatum and `rachitic rosary', chostochondral thickening), kyphoscoliosis, growth failure, tetany, craniotabes (thinning of skull bones), delayed closure of fontanels and sutures, and frontal bone thickening with bossing.

Radiologic findings of Rickets often precede clinical manifestations. Radiologic diagnosis is made by the following findings: Widening of the physis, Irregular metaphyseal margins (ill-defined zone of provisional calcification), Splaying and cupping of the metaphysis, Bowing of extremities, Osteopenia, Findings typical of osteomalacia. Radiologic evaluation of Rickets can be limited to the knees and wrists, which are the areas most affected because they are the sites of greatest linear growth. Widening and lengthening of the growth plate is the earliest radiologic finding of rickets. The irregular metaphyseal margins, with their "frayed" appearance, are a result of the defective mineralization of the chondrocytes in the zone of provisional calcification. An increase in cell number at the hypertrophic zone can protrude into the weakened metaphyseal region resulting in cupping and widening of the metaphysis. Prominence of the growth plates at the chostrochondral junctions produces the characteristic rachitic rosary. Defective osteiod mineralization is evident as diffuse osteopenia in the shafts of the long bones. Normal weight bearing and muscular stresses produce bowing of long bones, manifested as genu valgum or varus. Other complications can include scoliosis, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, a triradiate configuration of the pelvis, and basilar invagination. A depression, called Harrison's groove, along the line of diaphragmatic insertion into rib cage can sometimes be found. In advanced cases, insufficiency fractures (Looser zones) which are seen as bilateral symmetric linear lucencies perpendicular to the cortex, may be seen. Demineralization of the skull can result in craniotabes, or ping-pong ball sensation on palpation of the skull. Laboratory studies will show an increased serum alkaline phosphatase and a decreased calcium x phosphate product.

Management of Vitamin D deficiency includes administration of 1000-2000 U of Vitamin D3 daily for 6 — 12 weeks or alternatively 600,000 U IM.3 This supplementation will heal the rachitic process, with the most sensitive biochemical index of healing is normalization of the alkaline phosphatase. When achieved, Vitamin D supplementation can be reduced to the RDA of 400 IU. Additionally, elemental calcium (50mg/kg/day) should also be administered at this time to avoid the hypocalcemia that accompanies remineralization of bone matrix, the "hungry bone syndrome".
