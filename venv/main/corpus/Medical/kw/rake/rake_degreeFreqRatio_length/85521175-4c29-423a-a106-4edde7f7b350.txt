Physical exam reveals diffuse enlargement of the thyroid.  No nodueles were palpable.  TSH = <0.01; FT4 = 2.8.  Nuclear medicine RAI uptake at 4 hours = 39%.  RAI uptake at 24 hours = 58%.
The patient is beginning treatment at this time.
The thyroid echotexture is diffusely heterogeneous.  The gland is enlarged and extremely hyperemic.  There are no masses or nodules noted.
