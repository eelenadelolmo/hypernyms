This patient's alkaline phosphatase levels never returned to baseline and she continues to experience intermittent fevers despite continuous use of antibiotics.  She presented with nausea and fever.  She was anicteric and had only minimal abdominal tenderness upon examination.
An attempt was made to traverse the area of obstuction with a hydrophylic wire after the system was decompressed for 48 hours but this attempt was unsuccessful.  Segmentectomy to remove the portion of the liver subserved by the obstructed sectoral branch as a definitive treatment strategy was discussed.

The patient was discharged with the external biliary drain in place.
The intial cholangiogram showed a non dilated but apparently diminutive biliary tree.  The surgical anastomis was patent.  A post conventional cholangiogram CT cholangiogram was performed confirming obstruction and isolation of the right posterior sectoral biliary duct and its radicals.  A second conventional cholangiogram confirmed this finding and an external drain was placed.
Obstruction and isolation of the right posterior sectoral duct and its radicals from the remainder of the biliary system.
Iatrogenic obstruction and isolation of the right posterior sectoral duct and its radicals from the remainder of the biliary system.
Prior laparoscopic cholecystectomy complicated by clipping of the proper hepatic duct.  She is now status post open surgical reanastomosis of the proper hepatic duct to a loop of jejunum - approximately six months prior to this admission. The initial postoperative T-tube cholangiogram showed a patent anastomosis and prompt antegrade flow of contrast into the bowel; and, subsequent examinations of the anastomosis confirmed continued patency.
Chronic mild elevation in alkaline phosphatase and intermittent fevers over a period of months without jaundice suggests obstruction of an isolated portion of the biliary system.  

Cross sectional imaging was essential to make this diagnosis. The task of confirming the existance of an isolated non-opacifying sectoral branch would have been difficult using conventional fluoroscopy alone.
