On physical exam, a hard mass was palpable on the medial aspect of the left amputation site.
Patient was taken to the operating room for resection of the heterotopic ossification.  After resection, patient's complaint of pain with prosthesis use was relieved.
Preoperative anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of left knee shows through-knee-amputation with irregularly bordered heterogeneous ossified densities juxtaposed to the posteromedial aspect of the distal femur.  These ossifications extend through the soft tissues and are consistent with heterotopic ossification.  The left femur shows normal bone density.  The remainder of the soft tissues appear normal.

Postoperative anterioposterior and lateral radiographs of left knee shows through-knee-amputation with small residual focal ossified densities near the medial epicondyle and the medial condyle.  The posterior aspect of the distal femur also shows focal area of ossified densities.  A percutaneous drain is in place in the soft tissue distal to the medial condyle.  Postoperative air is seen in the soft tissues.
Heterotopic ossification
The history of trauma combined with the clinical course and radiographic findings of the ossifications in the soft tissue are characteristic of heterotopic officiation.
29 year old active duty USMC male who sustained an improvised explosive device (IED) blast to bilateral lower extremities and who eventually required a through-knee-amputation in March 2005.  In January 2006 patient was seen in the orthopedic clinic with complaints of pain in left amputation site with prosthesis use.  Patient denied fevers, chills, night sweats, or weight loss.
Heterotopic ossification (HO) is the formation of bone in abnormal locations.(1-7)  HO is a well-acknowledged entity that is commonly divided into three categories: genetic, traumatic, and neurogenic.  HO has recently become a significant problem for the many amputees from Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).(1)

HO occurs frequently in many traumatic events including spinal cord injuries (20% - 30%), closed head injuries (10% - 20%), fractures, dislocations, and burns.  HO also frequently occurs after various medical interventions such as amputation (62%), total hip arthroscopy (43%) and open reduction internal fixation.(1-3)  More rare causes of HO that have been reported include encephalitis, meningitis, tetanus, brain tumors, epidural abscess, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.(3)

HO is believed to originate from inappropriate recruitment or differentiation of pluripotent mesenchymal cells into osteogenic cells.  Two factors proposed to induce this recruitment or differentiation are bone morphogenic protein-4 (BMP-4) and prostaglandins E2 (PGE2).(1,2,4) Various risk factors have been identified for the development of HO including male gender, history of HO, hypertrophic osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, multiple injuries, and lateral approach in total hip arthroscopy.(3)

Most patients with HO are completely asymptomatic.  Patients who are symptomatic commonly complain initially of nonspecific signs and symptoms including fever, erythema, swelling, and pain.  Later, they begin to complain of decreased joint mobility and continued pain despite improvement of their fever, erythema, and swelling.(2)  Many traumatic amputees with HO complain of pain with prostheses use.(1)

HO is most commonly diagnosed incidentally on plain radiographs.  The typical radiographic appearance of HO, when mature, is focal distinctive ossifications in the muscle and other soft tissue.  They also may be contiguous with the periosteum of bone.  Four to six weeks after the inciting event, plain radiographs usually show mature HO lesions.  Although plain radiographs are adequate to diagnosis HO, three-phase bone scintigraphy has been shown to be able to detect HO earlier (2.5 weeks after inciting event).(2,5)  Alkaline Phosphatase and 24-hour PGE2 urinary excretion are also used as an adjunct in diagnosing HO.(2)

Common complications of HO needing intervention include decreased range-of-motion, pain, peripheral nerve entrapments, and pressure ulcers.  Traumatic amputees with HO have the additional complication with prosthesis fitting.(1)

Management of HO is controversial with new therapies on the horizon.  The most common management strategies for HO are radiation therapy and NSAIDs.  Numerous studies have been conducted evaluating the efficacy of both radiation therapy and NSAIDs as well as comparing the efficacy between the two management strategies.  There does not appear to be a difference between the efficacy of radiation therapy and NSAIDs in preventing HO development.  Seven Gy of radiation therapy is commonly given within 24 hours pre-operation of total hip arthroplasty.  There is no consensus of which NSAID is most effective, but commonly a 5-6 week period of NSAIDs is administered post-operation.(6)  Resection is the last management modality that is used with symptomatic HO.  Resection is usually done only after radiologic and laboratory evidence of metabolic inactivity of the HO.(2)  Various animal studies have shown promise for a BMP-4 antagonist (noggin) for those who are at risk for HO development.(4)
