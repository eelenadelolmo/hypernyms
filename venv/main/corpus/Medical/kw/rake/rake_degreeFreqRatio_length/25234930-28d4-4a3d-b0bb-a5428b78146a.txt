Texto: 
Bronchial washings - no malignant cells, no eosinophilia, no organisms isolated
Steroids as above
Several axial CT images demonstrate patchy bilateral consolidations along the bronchovascular bundles with diffuse ground glass. 

Conventional chest radiographs show improvement in the disease process in 48 hours after steroid administration.
BOOP/COP
Atypical infectious etiologies to include fungal/TB
Sarcoid
Bronchoalveolar Carcinoma
Eosinophilic Pneumonia
Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia (COP - previously BOOP)
Low grade fever with cough
Histologic diagnosis:(Masson Cells â€“granulation tissue plugs in the bronchioles)
Etiologies include drugs, post infectious, toxic inhalational, cryptogenic
(40-60, no sex predilection)
Elevated ESR (>60) in 30% of patients
Clinically â€“ cough and low grade fever
No improvement with antibiotics

CT Findings:
Patchy consolidations in subpleural or peribronchial distribution, ground glass
May present with centrilobular nodules, adenopathy, or effusions (approx 30%)
Reverse halo (ground glass surrounded by consolidation â€“ 30%)
Differential: atypical infections, TB, MAI, Sarcoid, BAC, eosinophilic pneumonia, lymphoma

Relapses are common after cessation of steroid therapy and the consolidations may persist despite therapy.
