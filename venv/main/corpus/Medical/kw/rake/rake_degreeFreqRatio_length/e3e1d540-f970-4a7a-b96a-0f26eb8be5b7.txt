The lesion is usually cured by curettage and the patient is scheduled for surgery.
Radiographically it is a cyst into which the crown of the tooth projects.  As the cyst grows, it pulls the unerupted tooth with it.  When small, dentigerous cysts are unilocular.  When large, they may be multilocular. The tooth within the cyst may be displaced from its normally expected location, and there may be resorption of the roots of neighboring teeth.  Only the permanent teeth are affected.  The most common locations are the unerupted mandibular third molars, the maxillary canines, the maxillary third molars and the mandibular second premolars.

This represents the classic appearance of dentigerous cysts with the crown of the tooth projecting into the lesion. Dental pathology is frequently an "incidental" finding on sinus CTs or ER facial CT.
