Intubated with positive pressure ventilation requiring sustained high pressures.
Intubated infant with diffuse, small, sharply defined round and rod shaped lucencies consistent with PIE.  Lucencies are superimposed on increased interstitial and airspace opacity related to underlying bronchopulmonary dysplasia and shifting atlectasis.  A focal coalescence of lucency is present in the left costophrenic angle.
Pulmonary Interstitial Emphysema (PIE)
Underlying opacity:
BPD
HMD
Atlectasis
Infection
Former 29 week premature infant, now neonatal week 5.  History of severe hyaline membrane disease, intubated with assisted ventilation since birth.
