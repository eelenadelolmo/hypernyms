History of prior left mastectomy.  Otherwise, the patient has been feeling fine.  No labs were obtained (such as a D-dimer), as the patient was being worked up for a new lung nodule.
Patient was placed on Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 for at least three months.
Plain film images were non-contributory as the patient did not have a pulmonary nodule.  CT imaging reveales a filling defect in the lobar pulmonary artery to the left lingula.  Additional filling defects were present in multiple segmental arteries of the right lower lung, as well as in the lobar artery of the right lower lobe.  No evidence of complete occlusion or pulmonary infarct.
Pulmonary Embolism
None.
History of breast cancer.  Was found to have a possible new lung nodule on routine PA and lateral chest radiographs.
