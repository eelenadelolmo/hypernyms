Mitral valve replacement
PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate cardiomegally with both moderate left ventricular enlargement and marked left atrial enlargement. The gigantic left atrium contributes to both the left and right heart boarders. This finding was verified on echocardiography, where a 9 cm left atrium was demonstrated.  The lateral image of the chest demonstrates both left ventricular and left atrial enlargement. The left atrium is seen to overly the anterior aspect of the thoracic spine as well as to displace the left mainstem bronchus posteriorly and superiorly.
Mitral Regurgitation

Papillary muscle dysfunction
Calcified mitral annulus

77 y/o male with severe mitral and mild aortic regurgitation
