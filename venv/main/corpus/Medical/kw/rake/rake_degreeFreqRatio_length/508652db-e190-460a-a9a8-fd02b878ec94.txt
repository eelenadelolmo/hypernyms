Diffuse wrist pain, without significant soft tissue swelling.
Pending.
A posteroanterior radiograph of the right wrist shows scapholunate dissociation and narrowing of the radioscaphoid and lunatocapitate articulations.  In more advanced cases (not shown), pancarpal degenerative changes and flattening of the scaphoid and lunate bones may be seen.
SLAC (scapholunate advanced collapse) wrist (i.e., carpal instability).  These radiographic findings are pathognomonic for the diagnosis.
Carpal instability: scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC) wrist related to degenerative joint disease versus to calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease.
A 63-year-old Caucasian male with a history of a prior right wrist injury now presents with increasing right wrist pain.
Carpal dislocation - Please see the accompanying factoid.
