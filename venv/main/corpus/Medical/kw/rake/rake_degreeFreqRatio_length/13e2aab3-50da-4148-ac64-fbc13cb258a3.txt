Color and gray-scale sonography of the liver demonstrates diffusely increased echogenicity of the portal tracts, secondary to periportal fibrotic changes.  When compared to the prior sonogram from 2006, these findings are more pronounced.

Sonographic evaluation of the kidneys demonstrates enlargement with diffusely increased echogenicity and loss of the normal corticomedullary differentiation.  Numerous microcysts are visualized within the renal parenchyma.

The right kidney measures 11.5 cm in length.  The left kidney measures 13.2 cm in length.  When compared to the sonogram from 2006,  the renal parenchyma has increased in echotexture.

11 year old girl with known diagnosis presenting for evaluation of liver and kidneys.
This patient was born with renal insufficiency and admitted to the NICU for a period of 45  days.  Further work-up revealed the diagnosis of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.   As an outpatient, her renal function has improved, and the patient is currently being treated for systemic hypertension with hydrochlorothiazide, which, according to her parents, has helped to stabilize her hypertension.
