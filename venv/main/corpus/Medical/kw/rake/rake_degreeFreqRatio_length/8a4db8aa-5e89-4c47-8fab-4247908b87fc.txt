AP radiograph of the right knee shows cortical irregularity at the superior aspect of the medial femoral condyle, and lateral aspect of the lateral femoral condyle. The patient is post BKA, with prior surgical changes noted in the proximal tibia and diffuse osteopenia. Heterotopic ossification and shrapnel are seen in the soft tissues.

Lateral radiograph of the right knee shows a complex fracture of the distal femur, with cortical disruption of the medial femoral condyle and a 6 mm gap involving the lateral femoral condyle.  A joint effusion is noted. The patient is post BKA, with prior surgical changes noted in the proximal tibia and diffuse osteopenia. Heterotopic ossification and shrapnel are seen in the soft tissues.

Nonenhanced axial CT image in bone windows through the level of the femoral condyles, shows the complex fracture with an associated joint effusion with three distinct layers: an anterior fat density layer, an intermediate fluid density layer, and a posterior hyperdense layer.

Nonenhanced axial CT image in soft tissue windows through the level of the femoral condyles, shows the complex fracture with an associated joint effusion with three distinct layers: an anterior fat density layer, an intermediate fluid density layer, and a posterior hyperdense layer.

X-table lateral radiograph of the right knee shows interval placement of a partially imaged trans-tibial pin and reduction of the complex distal femoral fracture. The joint effusion again demonstrates three distinct layers: an anterior fat density layer, an intermediate fluid density layer, and a posterior hyperdense layer.
Lipohemarthrosis (s/p BKA for IED & shrapnel injury)
26 year old man with with a swollen knee after falling.  Past history of a below the knee amputation (BKA) five years ago.
