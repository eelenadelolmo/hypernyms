Surgical closure of defect postnatally.
Sagittal and axial T2W MRI images demonstrate a well-defined ovoid sac immediately adjacent to the anterior abdominal wall.  The sac is in continuity with the intraperitoneal contents through a small central defect. The sac appears to be filled primarily with bowel.  No other anomalies were noted.
Omphalocele
• Omphalocele
• Gastroschisis
30 week fetus with abnormal ultrasound.
Failure of proper closure of the abdominal wall during fetal life results in a number of abnormalities, the most common of which are omphalocele and gastroschisis.  Omphalocele is a midline defect, which results from failure of the lateral abdominal folds to fuse.  The herniated abdominal contents consist of bowel, liver or both.  The contents are covered by a sac of peritoneum, as seen in this case.  Patients with omphalocele typically have a worse prognosis than patients with gastroschisis given that up to 2/3 of the patients will have associated anomalies.  Treatment is surgical closure postnatally.
