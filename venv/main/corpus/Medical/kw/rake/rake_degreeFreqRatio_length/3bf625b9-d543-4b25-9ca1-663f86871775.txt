The patient expired secondary to his metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Single contrast enhanced axial image at the level of the kidneys demonstrates air within the biliary system.  Also identified is a biliary stent. No significant biliary dilitation is noted.
Pneumobilia
Portal venous gas vs. Biliary gas

Portal venous gas tends to extend to the periphery of the liver as opposed to biliary air which is more central in its location
82 y/o male with pancreatic cancer and biliary obstruction who is status post biliary stent placement in xs 2 in 2002 who presents with reobstruction of the biliary tree.  Exam performed to evaluate tumor progression and extent of involvement in the biliary tree.
When air is present in the biliary tree on radiographic examination thought should be given to whether the patient has had surgery or other procedure involving the biliary tree.  This can cause abnormal communication between the biliary tree and the bowel therefore allowing air into the biliary system.

Patients with penetrating, gallstones, Crohn's disease, some malignancies and duodenal ulcers are prone to pneumobilia.
