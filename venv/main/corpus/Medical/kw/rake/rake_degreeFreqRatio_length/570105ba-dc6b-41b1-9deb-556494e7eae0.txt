No fever with a normal white blood cell count.
Right knee radiographs:  Diffuse and marked osteoarthritic degenerative changes and heterotopic bone formation around the right knee associated with a right total knee arthroplasty.  Lucencies around the right knee prosthesis are most consistent with loosening. Osteomyelitis can not be entirely excluded.

Bone scintigraphy with Tc-99m MDP:  Images reveal non specific foci as well as mild linear uptake associated with the femoral and tibial components of the right knee prostheses.  

Images obtained after In-111 oxine-labeled autologous red blood cells injection:  A pattern of mild linear uptake along the perimeter of the prosthesis with a more focal component in the supracondylar region.

Bone marrow scintigraphy with Tc-99m sulfur colloid: Increased sulfur colloid uptake grossly correlating with the leukocyte accumulations within the bone marrow about the right knee prosthesis consistent with locally expanded/displaced bone marrow.  No specific evidence of osteomyelitis.

Status post a right total knee arthroplasty with concerns for loosening verses osteomyelitis.
A negative bone scan would have essentialy ruled out osteomyelitis.  Unfortunately, this patient had a bone scan with non specific increased radiotracer accumulations around the prosthesis. It should be noted that some increased uptake around the prothesis is expected as a normal remodling response for up to one year when a cemented prosthesis is placed and for up to 2-3 years after placement of a noncemented prosthesis.  This patientâ€™s prosthesis had been present for less than a year so the increased uptake is expected however in this case with clinically suspected loosening verses infection is non specific and limits evaluation.

As a result of the positive bone scan, an Indium tagged white blood cell scan was performed.  The radiolabeled WBC's localize in areas of infection and as well in normal or displaced/expanded marrow but not in areas of remodeling or reactive bone secondary to loosening.  In this case, the right knee had mild linear increased radiotracer uptake around the prosthesis with a more focal component in the supracondylar region. This can represent infection or marrow though lack of a corresponding focus on the bone scan at this point makes much infection less likely. Nevertheless, to further evaluate this finding, bone marrow scintigraphy was performed with Tc-99m sulfur colloid.  The areas of increased radiotracer uptake on the In-111 tagged white blood cell scan grossly correlated with the same areas of increased radiotracer uptake on the sulfur colloid images. If osteomyelitis was present, uptake on the WBC study would have been incongruant with the sulfur colloid images . In retrospect, as a critique, the confidence in the findings could have been increased by using a "dual window" technique to improve anatomic correlation between the In-111 WBC study and the Tc 99m Sulfur colloid study as was done with the bone scan and WBC study.     

Overall, the constellation of the radiographic and scintigraphic findings support loosening.
