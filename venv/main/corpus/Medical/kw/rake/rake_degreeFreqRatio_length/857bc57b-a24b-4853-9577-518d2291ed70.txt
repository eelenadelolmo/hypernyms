Hematuria.
None.
The liver is enlarged and extends inferiorly to the level of the pelvis.  Incidentally noted are numerous surgical clips consistent with the surgical history.
Reidel's lobe of the Liver
Hepatic enlargement:
1. Malignancy: Lymphoma, hepatocellular CA, metastases
2. Vascular:  Passive congestion 
3. Infxn/Infl'n: Hepatitis, mononucleosis, TB, sarcoid
                 histoplasmosis
4. Metabolic: Amyloid, fatty infiltration, storage
              diseases
Hematuria and flank pain.  There is a history of colectomy and Crohn's disease.
This is a normal variant not associated with the patient's Crohn's disease.  Numerous laboratory evaluations, CT examinations and direct evaluation during surgery show that there is no intrinsic liver disease.
