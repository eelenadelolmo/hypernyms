No treatment required.  Since some cases of cavernous malformation are hereditary, recommended follow up studies to include gradient echo MR sequence to look for additional lesions.
MR images demonstrate a well delineated complex core of mixed signal intensities with a low signal hemosiderin rim; and, with enhancement of the medial aspect of the core after contrast administration.
