ataxia during finger to nose test and positive Romberg sign
The patient also had an arteriovenous fistula that was demonstrated during the late arterial and venous phase imaging.  This was treated with an endovascular coil embolization requiring subsequent angiographic follow up.
Left common carotid artery injection demonstrates significantly enlarged internal carotid artery.  There is an abnormal anomalous connection between the internal carotid artery and the vertebral basilar system.
Proatlantal artery, Type 1
Type 1 or Type 2 Proatlantal (segmental) artery
73 year-old woman with a posterior circulation ischemic event was referred to neurointerventional radiology for potential catheter directed thrombolytic therapy.
The arteriovenous fistula component of the case will be presented as a separate topic.
