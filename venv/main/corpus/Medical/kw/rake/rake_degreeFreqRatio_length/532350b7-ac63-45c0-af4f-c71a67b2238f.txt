Despite prompt surgical treatment, the patient did not survive the post-operative course.  The patient passed away at post-operative day 3.
Multiple axial CT images of the chest with intravenous contrast material demonstrates a Stanford type A thoracic aortic dissection, with a clear intimal flap separating the true and false lumens of the ascending aorta.  Additionally, the pericardium full of dense fluid, likely hemopericardium.
