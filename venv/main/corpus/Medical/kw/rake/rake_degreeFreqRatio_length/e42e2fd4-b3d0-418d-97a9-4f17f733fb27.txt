Supportive
Again noted is severe cerebellar atrophy involving both the
cerebellar hemispheres and the vermis and disproportionate to the rest of the brain.  Since the last scan, flattening and atrophy of the pons appears to be slightly worsened from the previous examination, and the pons is definitely smaller than the comparison study from 2005 with a concave appearance to the inferior aspect.
Olivopontocerebellar Atrophy (OPCA)
• Multiple system atrophy
• Chronic alcohol abuse
• Parkinson's disease
• Progressive Supranuclear Palsy
• Paraneoplasic cerebellar degeneration
• Friedreich ataxia
• Cortical basal ganglionic degeneration
• Multiple sclerosis
Patient is a 66 y/o woman with progressive gait dysfunction, Parkinson's disease, and cerebellar dysfunction that worsened over the past year.
