Treatment and definitive diagnosis has traditionally been provided by means of hysterectomy.  Presently, accurate diagnosis with MRI has led to more frequent trials of conservative medical therapy.  Uterine artery embolization is proposed by some as a possible alternative to surgery.
This case demonstrates adenomyosis and leiomyomata.
No prior imaging noted.
Enlarged uterus with predominantly low T2 signal throughout.  Loss of the normal junctional in all areas except along the anatomic inferior wall and cervical canal.  Small focal high T2 signal abnormalities.  A solitary well-circumscribed low T2 focus is seen along anterior fundal wall consistent with a fibroid.  Other such abnormalities are seen on the coronal T2image. Pedunclulated low T2 signal mass filling and expanding the uterine cavity:  Polyp vs pedunculated fibroid.
