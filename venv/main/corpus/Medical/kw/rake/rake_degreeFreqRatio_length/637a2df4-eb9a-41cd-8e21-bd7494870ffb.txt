Texto: 
With respect to the long bones, there is metaphyseal fraying andcupping with apparent widening of the epiphyses. This involves all the ends of the long bones. There is diffuse coarsening of the trabecula
of the osseous structures.
Evidence of healing fractures of the left distal humerus, right proximal tibia and right distal femur evidenced by periosteal reaction and sclerosis. Findings are consistent with insufficiency fractures.
There is multilevel flaring of the rib ends bilaterally.
