Texto: 
Patient afebrile in paced sinus rhythm.

Difficulty with speech.  Speaking in broken phrases.

Patient somewhat incoherent while simultaneously experiencing left upper extremity hemiparesis.

Crainial nerves intact.
The patient was treated with TPA on the ward after consult with Neurology.  Given the presence of the patient's pacemaker, the inability to obtain the "gold-standard" diffusion weighted MRI to rule out cerebovascular ischemia threw a curveball to the patient's ward team.  However, with the patient's constellation of symptoms, head CT findings, and the fact that no hemmorhage was detected on the imaging, it was felt that a thrombolytic agent was both safe and indicated in this patient's management.
â€¢ Focal area of hypodensity
Â» right precentral gyrus
Â» suggestive of ischemic change or infarct
Acute infarct detection with non-contrast CT
Ischemia, acute or chronic (age indeterminate)
Encephalomalacia - post old infarction
65 y.o. man with sudden onset of slurred speech and left-sided hemiparesis - during inpatient cardiology hospitalization.
NOTE:  Some authors claim that visibility of acute infarct changes on CT may be a contraindication to thrombolysis.
