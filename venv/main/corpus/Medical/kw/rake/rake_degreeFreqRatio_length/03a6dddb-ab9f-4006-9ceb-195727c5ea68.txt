Patient presented to the emergency department with several hours of abdominal pain.
Arrowhead sign is a secondary sign of appendicitis seen CT imaging. The arrowhead sign results when oral/rectal contrast material collects in the upper part of the cecum near the appendiceal orifice. The sign is formed by the extension of inflammation from the appendix into the cecum.
