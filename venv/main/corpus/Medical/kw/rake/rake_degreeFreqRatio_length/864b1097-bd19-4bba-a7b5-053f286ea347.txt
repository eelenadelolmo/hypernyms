Reduction of the acute dislocation followed by physical therapy.  Surgery is reserved for patients with repeated dislocations or persistent pain.
Frontal radiograph of the right shoulder with external rotation shows a sclerotic  vertical line in the medial humeral head - the trough line which is the medial margin of the impacted fracture of the humeral head.  These findings are consistent with a prior posterior shoulder dislocation with impaction of the anterior humeral head.  No acute fracture or dislocation.

Not applicable.
