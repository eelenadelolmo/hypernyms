PE significant for R eye ptosis and general significant discomfort due to pain.
Scatter laser treatment
Persistent high density in the retro orbital region on the right, consistent with a retinal hemorrhage.

Thickened right peri-orbital soft tissues consistent with edema. The optic nerve is intacT.  

The left globe is within normal limits.  The visualized sinuses are within normal limits.  The osseous structures are intact.
Retinal hemmorhage secondary to diabetic retinopathy
Acute glaucoma
Intracranial mass
Foreign body or corneal abrasion
Viral or bacterial conjunctivitis
Keratitis due to herpes simplex
Orbital or periorbital cellulitis
Ophthalmic zoster
Uveitis
Temporal arteritis
Optic neuritis
69 y/o Caucasian male with PMHx significant for poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, HTN, and thrombocytopenia (most likely secondary to myelofibrosis) presented to ER with acute onset of unilateral (R) retroorbital pain without radiation.  Pain is described as sharp and pressure over the right eye with involvement of the frontotemporal region of the head.  Pt denies hx of trauma, change in mental status, new rashes on the face, or recent travel.
Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes and a leading cause of blindness. It occurs when diabetes damages the tiny blood vessels inside the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. At first, patients with diabetic retinopathy may be asymptomatic with no changes in vision. But over time, diabetic retinopathy can get worse and cause vision loss. Diabetic retinopathy usually affects both eyes.

Diabetic retinopathy has four stages:

• Mild Nonproliferative Retinopathy
At this earliest stage, microaneurysms occur. They are small areas of balloon-like swelling in the retina's tiny blood vessels.

• Moderate Nonproliferative Retinopathy 
As the disease progresses, some blood vessels that nourish the retina are blocked.

• Severe Nonproliferative Retinopathy 
Many more blood vessels are blocked, depriving several areas of the retina with their blood supply. These areas of the retina send signals to the body to grow new blood vessels for nourishment.

• Proliferative Retinopathy 
At this advanced stage, the signals sent by the retina for nourishment trigger the growth of new blood vessels. This condition is called proliferative retinopathy. These new blood vessels are abnormal and fragile. They grow along the retina and along the surface of the clear, vitreous gel that fills the inside of the eye. 

Blood vessels damaged from diabetic retinopathy can cause vision loss in two ways:

Fragile, abnormal blood vessels can develop and leak blood into the center of the eye, blurring vision. 

Fluid can leak into the center of the macula, the part of the eye where sharp, straight-ahead vision occurs. The fluid makes the macula swell resulting in macular edema. It can occur at any stage of diabetic retinopathy, although it is more likely to occur as the disease progresses. About half of the people with proliferative retinopathy also have macular edema.
