Smooth posterior impression which crossed the esophagus with left aortic arch.
Aberrant right subclavian artery
Posterior impression on esophagus
  Aberrant right subclavian art with left aortic arch
  Aberrant left subclavian with right aortic arch
43 yo male with history of dysphagia for 20 years.
Aberrant right subclavian artery with left aortic arch is a normal variant which is usually asymptomatic although rarely dysphagia is reported.  It is formed during embryogenesis as a result of disappearance of the fourth arch.  The trachea is in its normal position.

Differential Diagnosis for esophageal and tracheal impression seen on a UGI examination include:

Posterior impression on esophagus
   Aberrant right subclavian art with left aortic arch
   Aberrant left subclavian with right aortic arch

Posterior impression on esophagus & anterior impression on trachea
  Double aortic arch
  Right aortic arch with aberrant 
              left subclavian artery

Anterior impression on trachea
       Innominate a. arising to the left of 
           the trachea & ascending anteriorly

Posterior impression on trachea & anterior impression on esophagus 
       Pulmonary sling (aberrant left pulmonary 
          artery arising from right
          pulmonary artery & slings post to the left)
