Patient fully alert and oriented. His neurological exam revealed a right sided hemiparesis with strengths of 2/5 in his right lower extremity and 3/5 in the right upper extremity. He was hyperreflexic right greater than left, had right sided spasticity, and a right babinski present with clonus in the ankle. He also had decreased sensation to light touch throughout his right side including his face.
This patient received a six week course or radiation and will start a phase 2 clinical chemotherapy trial at the NIH. He was also started on seizure prophylaxis and pain medication.
Solitary deep lesion with mild midline shift and patchy enhancement.  Abnormal white matter signal in the right hemisphere suggesting tumor extension across the corpus callosum.
Brain biopsy confirmed glioblastoma multiforme.
<li>Astrocytoma - Anaplastic (usually does not show 'cystic' or necrotic area)
<li>Glioblastoma Multiforme (usually brighter enhancement)
<li>Primary CNS Lymphoma (usually lower signal on T2W)
<li>Tumefactive Demyelination (usually does not show edema like this)
This patient presented with 3 weeks of progressive weakness in right upper and lower extremities.
Gliomas are graded on the most aggressive histology.  A small region of GBM may arise or coexist within larger areas of Anaplastic Astrocytoma.  GBM usually presents in older patients (typically >40 yrs.)
