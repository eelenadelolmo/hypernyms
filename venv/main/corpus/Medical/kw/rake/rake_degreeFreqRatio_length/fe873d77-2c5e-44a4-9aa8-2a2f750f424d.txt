Per CT surgery, drain in place.  Follow up echo to eval for resolution.
Inital radiograph with pneumomediastinum. Follow up demonstrating new enlarging cardiac silhoette. CT demonstrates post surgical changes of the thorax with subcutaneous emphysema in the presternal region.  Sternotomy wires without dehiscence.  Pneumomediastinum with large hemopneumopericardium.  Surgical drain enters the subxiphoid region and curls posteriorly along the base.  Valvular prosthesis is seen at the level of the aortic root. No aortic dissection. Additionally, well circumscribed small fluid collection in the presternal space without enhancement likely seroma.
Pericardial Effusion following Open Heart Surgery
(hemopneumopericardium)
None
Status post aortic valve replacement.
Normal pericardial thickness 2mm and pericardial space contains 20-50 ml fluid normally. Effusion therefore implies greater than 50ml fluid.  The pericardial space can contain 150-250ml acute volume prior to tamponade. Blood in the pericardial space increases the HU to 40.  Effusions are lower measuring water density 10-20 HU. 

Contents of pericardial effusion guide differential.  Transudate – CHF, low albumin and irradiation. Exudate – infectious, uremia, collagen diseases or hypersensitivity. Blood as in this case – iatrogenic, trauma, myocardial rupture following infarct, rupture of ascending aorta, or neoplastic.  Lymph – neoplastic, or following surgery, or congenital.  

Findings to look for: water bottle configuration, loss of retrosternal clear space, separation of retrosternal from epicardial fat line greater than 2 mm, rapidly appearing cardiomegaly with normal vascularity, increased lucency at heart margin secondary to contrast differences between muscle and fluid.
