1. Decreased Hematocrit.
Surgical resection with Whipple's procedure.  With extensive hepatic metastases, prognosis is poor.
Small bowel follow-through fluoroscopic exam with spot compression images display a focal area of concentric narrowing with abrupt shouldering located within the distal 3rd portion of the duodenum.

Oral and IV contrast enhanced CT of abd/pelvis demonstrates a 4x2 cm mass and indistinct thickening of the 3rd and 4th portions of the duodenum with surrounding enlarged, pathologic lymph nodes.  Also, multiple indistinct, large hypoattenuating lesions are present throughout the liver.
Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
1. Adenocarcinoma
2. Carcinoid
3. Leiomyosarcoma
4. Metastases
5. Lymphoma
6. Duodenitis
7. IBD
1. Melena with no source discovered via EGD or colonoscopy.
2. Decreased appetite.
3. Generalized weakness.
Types of small bowel malignancy include adenocarcinoma, carcinoid, lymphoma, leiomyosarcoma and metastases. The most common small bowel malignancy is carcinoid.  No findings, including desmoplastic reaction of the mesentery, are seen in this case.
Primary adenocarcinoma of the small bowel is a rare entity accounting for less than 1% of all primary GI malignancies.  
The most common location of adenocarcinoma to occur in small bowel is within the duodenum.  
Barium studies and CT can both be helpful for detecting small bowel adenocarcinoma. 
Pancreatic carcinoma can, as in this case, affect the small bowel by direct extension or through metastasis. It is also a type of adenocarcioma.  Prognosis is poor with a mean survival rate of 8% at one year.
