Intact moderate size sacrococcygeal tumor measuring ~10 cm x 12 cm which transilluminates and is highly vascular on the surface.  Anus displaced anteriorly secondary to tumor. Normally formed female genitalia.  Moves extremities, tone is appropriate.
Transabdominal and sacral resection of a giant sacrococcygeal teratoma with coccygectomy.  She will have regular follow up with surgery clinic and monitoring of AFP levels.
CT angiogram abdomen and pelvis: A large sacrococcygeal mass (teratoma) is well identified. There is an internal component and an external component. The tumor begins at the level of the aortic bifurcation at S1. There is a large feeding vessel which appears to arise from the aorta posteriorly, at the level of the bifurcation. The mass measures approximately 12.8 cm x 10.7 cm x 8.7 cm. A large portion of the external tumor mass appears to be fluid-filled. There are several cystic components in the mass. The spine is grossly normal, no skeletal lesion is identified. The bladder is elevated and is quite distended. 

MRI lumbar spine without contrast: There is a large mixed cystic and solid mass extending posteriorly from just below the tip of the coccyx. This lesion has a relatively substantial intra-abdominal component. The mass anterior to the spine measures approximately 2.5 x 5.6 x 3.0 cm. There is evidence of a relatively normal sized thoracic and abdominal aorta. The bladder is decompressed in comparison with the prior study. The bowel cannot be followed. There is no evidence of a lytic or blastic lesion. The examination is limited because the patient is in renal failure and contrast could not be provided.
Mature sacrococcygeal teratoma
• Teratoma
• Dermoid Tumor
• Sarcoma
• Neuroblastoma
• Meningomyelocele
The patient is a term baby girl admitted for management and resection of a prenatally diagnosed tumor.  She was born in vertex position by scheduled C-section  to a 25 yo gravida 2 para 1 mother.  Pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes treated with diet and metformin.  APGARs at 1 and 5 minutes were 9 and 9 respectively.  Birth weight was 4010 grams, length 50 cm, head circumference 35 cm.
