Radiosurgery
MRI of the brain with contrast demonstrates a 2-cm left posterior frontal parasagittal meningioma.  
The lesion demonstrates diffuse enhancement and no significant surrounding edema.
Meningioma
• Lymphoma
• Metastatic carcinoma
• Inflammatory lesions (ex: sarcoidosis & Wegener's granulomatosis)
• Meningioma
• Infections (ex: TB)
31 yo woman with headaches for the past several months and several episodes of right arm weakness
ROS: Negative

Allergies: NKDA
Family History: Breast Cancer
The patient received stereotactic radiosurgery with gamma knife for parafalcine meningioma.  She continues to have some headaches, which may or may not be related to this lesion, as they antedated its diagnosis by more than a year.  The headaches are largely unchanged.  She has no other neurologic symptoms.
