In addition to presumed post-operative changes, increased "three-phase" activity in the visualized left lower extremity, with a predominantly periarticular distribution on the delayed images.

DDx for left lower extremity findings:
-Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome (reflex sympathetic dystrophy)
-stress/gait-related changes
-arthritic changes
Distant history of falling onto his back, and s/p sacral fusion in September 2004.  Now with low back pain, left lower extremity pain, and allodynia.  MRI of the spine negative for cord compression or impingement pathology.
