Crackles at the right lung base.
Abnormal EKG
After an extensive pre-operative workup, an nephrostomy was performed.
After eliminating tuberculosis as a possible sourch of the patients bronchiectasis, treatment of the bronchiectasis was delayed.
A complete evaluation of the patents heart disease and pulmonary hypertension was also delayed.
-Double aortic arch
-Right heart enlargment and failure
-Pulmonary hypertension
-Left atrial enlargment
-Left venticular hypertrophy
-Endstage bronchiectasis envolving the entire right lower lobe
-Possible coronary artey and aortic valve abnormalities
-Diffuse ideopathathic skeletal hypertrophy
-Ectasia of the left renal vein
-Huge hypervascular left renal cell carcinoma with central necrosis
-Diverticulosis
Near miss of the renal cell carcinoma due to the "satisfaction of search" phenomena
Hypernephroma/Renal cell carimona
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin 
Transitional cell carcinoma of renal pelvis
Oncocytoma (benign neoplasm)
Angiomyolipoma (benign neoplasm)
Metastatic melanoma
Metastasis from distant primary
Renal adenoma (benign neoplasm)
Pyelonephritis, Acute 
Pyelonephritis, Chronic 
Wilms Tumor 
Abscess
65 year old female with chronic cough and fatigue
The source of the patient's cough was diagnosised quickly and then the radiologist turned his attention completely to the pathology of the heart and the anomalies of the great vessels.  He didn't see the renal cell carcinoma until the technologist pointed it out during data sculpting to create 3D pictures of the double aortic arch
