On physical exam, she was noted to have a 1 cm firm, fixed, tender mass on the volar aspect of the proximal phalanx with a full range of motion.
Sensory examination was within normal limits.
After consideration of the treatment options, the patient elected to proceed with surgical excision.  Surgery revealed a discreet, firm, osteocartilaginous lesion on the surface of the proximal phalanx that did not communicate with the medullary canal. There was a shallow depression in the underlying cortex, correlating with the radiographic findings.  Histological evaluation revealed a lobulated fibrocartilaginous matrix with diffuse foci of ossification.  The vast majority of chondrocytes were of normal appearance; an occasional binucleate cell was found.  No mitotic figures were appreciated.  The histopathologic examination, supported by radiographic imaging and historical data, supported the diagnosis of periosteal chondroma.
Plain film examination revealed a 9mm x 5mm focal ossific lesion with a chondroid matrix. The mass was adjacent to the cortical surface of the proximal phalanx and demonstrated saucerization of the underlying bone.

MRI revealed a well demarcated lesion with a predominantly hypointense signal on both T1 and T2 weighted images, relative to skeletal muscle.  A central, linear focus of hyperintense signal was also present on T2 weighted images. The lesion did not communicate with the underlying bone or surrounding soft tissue.
Periosteal Chondroma
• Periosteal chondroma 
• Periosteal chondrosarcoma
• Periosteal osteosarcoma 
• Bizarre parosteal osteochondromatous proliferation
This 41 y.o. woman presented to the Orthopedic clinic with a two month history of a painful mass on her left middle finger.  The patient stated that the pain interfered with her work activity; she denied any trauma.  

The patient was referred to a hand specialist for definitive treatment.	Examination 1 month later revealed decreased grip strength in addition to the findings of the initial visit.
