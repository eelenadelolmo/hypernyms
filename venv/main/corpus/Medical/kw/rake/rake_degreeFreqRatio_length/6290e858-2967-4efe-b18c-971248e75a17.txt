Texto: 
Vital signs are normal.  The patient is in no acute distress.  There is minimal soft tissue swelling of the dorsum of the right foot.  The patient is able to move all of her toes and there is no crepitus.
Treatment options include decreased activity, support with orthotics or casting in the early stages to prevent distal bone collapse.  Surgical options include simple debridement with cartilage revision or tip-up osteotomy of the metatarsal to deflect the eroded cartilage away from the joint space.
Three views of the right foot demonstrate flattening/irregularity and osteosclerosis of the second metatarsal head.  There is widening of the second MTP joint.
Freiberg's Infraction.
Freiberg's Infraction, chronic.
23 year old female who presents to the emergency department with right foot pain after having her foot stepped on.
The findings in this case are consistent with a chronic condition, not an acute process that brought the patient to the emergency department.
