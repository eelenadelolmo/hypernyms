Swelling and palpable of the medial aspect of the left foot.
While no further imaging is necessary, MRI may be helpful to determine the extent of inflammation and to determine if fibrous bridging is present between the navicular and accessory navicular bones.
Posterior to the medial aspect of the navicular bone is a 2 x 1.2 cm accessory ossicle with clear sclerotic margins.  There is no evident osseous fusion to the adjacent navicular bone.
