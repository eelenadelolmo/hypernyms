Texto: 
Axial, coronal MIP, sagittal, and adjusted coronal plane images reveal bowel herniation through a right lateral abdominal wall defect, near the level of the iliac spines.  Oral contrast opacifies minimally dilated bowel to the point of prolapse, beyond which the prolapsed segment and remaining distal bowel are unopacified.  There is prolapsed omental fat as well, with mild inflammatory stranding.
Spigelian hernia
Spigelian hernia, congenital or acquired
54 y/o female with acute abdominal pain and  a history of remote abdominal surgery, evaluate for adhesion/obstruction.
Plain abdominal film showed possible obstruction
