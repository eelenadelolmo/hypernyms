59 y/o female presents with a large palpable mass in the posterolateral popliteal fossa of her left knee
Tumoral calcinosis is a rare genetic disorder that typically presents in young African men. It is characterized by an increase in proximal tubular phosphate transport, often in association with increased serum 1,25(OH)2 D3 concentrations. Serum calcium and PTH concentrations are typically within the normal range. The combination of hyperphosphatemia and normocalcemia results in a high calcium-phosphate product and calcium-phosphate deposition in soft tissues. These depositions present as swellings, sometimes painful, around large joints. They arise in the fascial planes between muscles, and calcify or ossify, usually appearing well circumscribed, lobulated and solid.Treatment is based on phosphate depletion with diet and antacids. The chronic administration of acetazolamide may also aid in the resolution of the deposits by increasing urinary phosphate excretion.
