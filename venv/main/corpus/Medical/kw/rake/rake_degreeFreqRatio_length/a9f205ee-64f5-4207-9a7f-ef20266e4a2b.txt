Opening pressure of lumbar puncture < 6 cm H2O
Neuro exam unremarkable
The patient's headache had subsequently decreased over the course of the work-up and he was discharged home.  A follow-up appointment a few days later revealed complete resolution of the headache.
MR: circumferential, smooth, increased T2/FLAIR signal of pachymeninges with associated enhancement.

Nuclear medicine CSF leak study: focal outpouching of radiotracer at cervicothoracic junction consistent with a CSF leak.  Marked delay of CSF circulation.
Intracranial Hypotension
Intracranial Hypotension
Leptomeningeal spread of tumor
Lumbar puncture
Post surgical dural reaction
Patient complained of worsening postural headache over the course of 3 weeks following a workout (weight lifting).  He also experienced transient diplopia.
Indium-111 DTPA injected intrathecally in to the lumbar subarachnoid space follows the flow of CSF without affecting it's dynamics.  In normal studies, the radiotracer reaches the basal cisterns by 1 hour, the frontal poles and sylvian fissures by 6 hours, and the cerebral convexities by 12 hours.  In this patient, there was no activity at the convexities even after 48 hours which is consistent with intracranial hypotension.
