Physical exam was unremarkable.  Complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were within normal limits.
Healing and revascularization of the lesion is dependent upon fragment stability and the degree of articular cartilage disruption. The Berndt and Harty classification system (1959) assigns lesions to one of four stages: small area of compressed subchondral bone (stage 1), partially detached fragment or flap (stage 2), completely detached fragment that remains in its crater (stage 3), and a loose body (stage 4). Stage 1 and 2 lesions are considered stable and are followed by close clinical evaluation. Stage 3 and 4 lesions are considered unstable loose fragments and are surgically removed or fixated. MRI has been found most valuable in surgical decision-making. Nelson et al. completed a small study of 12 patients with OCD of the talus and knee in 1990 that revealed a 91.7% correlation between MRI staging and arthroscopic staging.
AP and mortise radiographs of the left ankle shows a lucency in the medial talar dome.

T1-weighted sagittal MR image of the left ankle shows a focus of low signal intensity in the talar dome.

Coronal  proton-density MR image with fat saturation and sagittal STIR MR image shows a focal high-signal-intensity  osteochondral lesion of the medial talar dome with associated edema in the talus

2. Osteochondritis dissecans
Patient is a 35-year-old man with a history of a left distal fibular fracture in January 2003.  He now presents with repeated episodes of pain and swelling around the left lateral malleolus after playing basketball.
Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a painful, usually unilateral condition commonly affecting 20-40 year olds (men more frequently than women) whereby a segment of articular cartilage and attached subchondral bone becomes partially or completely separated from the underlying parent bone. Etiology is thought to be secondary to trauma. Medial talar dome injury may be related to plantar flexion of the foot with accompanying inversion, followed by rotation of the tibia on the talus.
   The use of MR imaging in the evaluation of OCD is credited in large part to the studies of De Smet. Specifically, he focused on the correlation between signal intensity and fragment stability. High signal intensity at the junction between the fragment and the parent bone on a T2 weighted image strongly suggests an unstable lesion.
