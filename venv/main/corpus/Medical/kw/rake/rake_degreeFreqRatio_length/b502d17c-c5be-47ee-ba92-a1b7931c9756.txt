Physical exam reveals a palpable 3-4 cm mass involving the posterior aspect of the right upper calf.
Axial and coronal T2 and T1 pre- and post-gad images demonstrate an intermediate mixed-intensity T1, high signal T2, intramuscular mass with serpentine enhancement within the lateral head of the gastrocnemius of the right lower extremity.

27 year old white male with right nontender calf mass.
This case demonstrates the classic imaging findings of a cavernous hemangioma within the lateral head of the gastrocnemius.  Soft tissue hemangiomas typically show intermediate signal intensity on T1 imaging, high signal T2, and marked enhancement which is often serpentine and may include flow voids.
