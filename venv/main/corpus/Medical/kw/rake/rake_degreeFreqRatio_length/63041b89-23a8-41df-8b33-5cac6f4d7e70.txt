VS: HR 130, BP 102/60, RR 16, O2 sat 98% on RA
Pulmonary: Breath sounds equal and clear bilaterally.
Cardiac: No murmurs, rubs, gallops.  PMI non-displaced. Chest non-tender.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, no masses or organomegaly.

ECG: No abnormalities or acute change.

CBC, BMP within normal limits.
This patient underwent surgical resection of the left atrial appendage and closure of the pericardium.
Chest with lateral:
• Rounded density of the left mediastinum and hilum.
• Normal heart size, left-sided aortic arch, normal pulmonary vascularity.

Chest CT with contrast:
• Prominent structure with extends anteriorly in the left upper lobe and drains into the left ventricle.

Chest MRI without contrast:
• Abnormal protrusion of he left atrial appendage, consistent with herniation through a pericardial defect.
• Pericardium visualized anterior to the right ventricle, but not well-visualized around the cardiac base to delineate the actual defect.
• No obvious filling defect within the herniated appendage to suggest thrombus.
Congenital Foramen of the Left Pericardium
• Congenital foramen of the left pericardium
• Pericardial cyst
• Tumor
• Enlarged pulmonary artery
• Left atrial appendage aneurysm
7 y.o. girl complains of acute chest pain and vomiting for the last two days.  Pain is substernal, without radiation and is not associated with difficulty breathing, diaphoresis or sweating.  She denies trauma or sick contacts.  She has a history of abdominal pain with extensive workup, currently being treated for reflux.  Recently she was diagnosed with hypertension - of unknown etiology.   She has a history of precocious puberty, currently on hormone therapy and is morbidly obese.
