Massive retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
Sporadic Burkitt's Lymphoma (Diffuse Small Noncleaved Cell Lymphoma)
-NHL(3rd most common malg. childhood)
-Undifferentiated/small noncleaved NHl(Burkitt)
-Hodgkin lymphoma
-Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia
History of enlarging abdomen with vague consitutional symptoms for several months.
Most common type pediatric non-Hogkin lymphoma
Arise from undifferentiated small noncleaved B-cell lymphocytes. Histopathology is described as a "starry-sky" pattern. It is the fastest growing human tumor with doubling time of 24 hrs. Typically no peripheral leukemia. Occurs as endemic form (seen in regions w/ endemic malaria)ex. Sub-Saharan Africa were it is 80-90% of childhood neoplasms. Presumed exposure to Plasmodium falciparum has synergistic effect on T-cell surveillance. Associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection(95%). See destructive bone lesions in the face/jaw. Non-Endemic form more common Europe/North America were it is 35-45%ped NHL;3% childhood neoplasm. Epstein-Barr isolated in minority of cases. See involvement Abdomen w/ small bowel and mesentery(ususally intraabdominal extranodal)with well defined homogenous tumor. Can infiltrate organs(kidneys,ovary,retroperitoneum). Pleual effusion/ascited common. Demonstrate dramatic response to chemotherapy
