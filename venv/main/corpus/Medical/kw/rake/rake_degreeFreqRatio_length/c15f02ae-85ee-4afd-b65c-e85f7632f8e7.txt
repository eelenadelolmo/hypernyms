Axial and coronal CT imgages demonstrate an expansile, cystic lesin within the left maxillary sinus. This lesion has areas of dense calcification (tooth-like) and soft tissue components. The lesion has caused bony remodeling of the sinus walls and has expanded into the osteomeatal unit, and protruding into the nasal cavity. Mucoperiosteal thickening is also present in the left ethmoid, sphenoid and left frontal sinuses.

26 year old female with a history of possible "maxillary cyst" that causes intermittent drainage into her posterior oral cavity. Prior oral surgery workup was negative by report.
Odontogenic Keratocysts compose up to 17% of all jaw cysts and usually occur in the second to third decade. The mandible is the usual site of origin, however, when ivolving the maxilla, extension to the maxillary sinuses is common and can lead to obstructive symptoms. These lesions are associated with Marfan's syndrome and Basal cell nevus syndrome, and may have neoplastic potential. These cysts tend to be unilocular, and surgical resection results in low recurrence rated.
