WBC 14.1 (3.6 to 10.6 normal range)

UA:
positive blood with 119 RBC/HPF
nitrate positive
leukocyst esterase negative

Urine culture negative after 24 hours
The patient was given Percocet 325/5 mg q4 hr prn and Alfuzosin 10 mg qd, instructions for hydration and a follow-up appointment with Urology.  In retrospect, the left UVJ stone may be visible on the initial radiograph.  Repeat plain films could therefore be used to reassess if clinically indicated.
1. KUB - No evident urinary calculus.

2. Stone protocol CT - The right kidney demonstrates a prominent extrarenal pelvis, but is otherwise unremarkable. The left kidney also has a prominent extrarenal pelvis with a 5 mm stone at the ureteropelvic junction. Mild hydroureter continues from this stone distally to a 6 mm stone at the uterovesical junction which demonstrates surrounding soft tissue swelling and edema.  Within the left renal inferior pole there is a 3 mm calyceal calculus. There is fat stranding surrounding the left kidney, likely edema.

3. In retrospect, the left UVJ stone may be visible on the initial KUB.
Nephrolithiasis - Simultaneous UVJ and UPJ Obstruction
Nephrolithiasis
28 year-old male with family but no personal history of nephrolithiasis presented to the ER with severe left flank pain for 1 day.
While UPJ and UVJ obstruction from ureterolithiasis can occur following lithotripsy, the current patient presented acutely without a history of treatment or a prior diagnosis.
