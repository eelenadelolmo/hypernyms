The patient was placed in a cast and follow up radiographs were obtained.  At 3 month follow-up there was a stable appearance of the fracture without evidence of healing.
Fracture of the base of the proximal phalynx on the ulnar aspect of the first ray.  The fracture involves the joint space and is minimally displaced.  This is consistent with an avulsion fracture involving the ulner collateral ligament (UCL) or Gamekeeper's thumb.
Gamekeeper's Thumb
Avulsion fracture of UCL with or without ligamentous injury.
Stener lesion (torn distal UCL pulled from beneath the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis)
14 y/o with left thumb pain, rule out fracture.
According to Wheeles' Textbook of Orthopedics these injuries heal will with immobilization.  One small study reported a 25% nonunion rate.  Surgical indications include gross instability, a Stener lesion or chronic Gamekeeper's thumb.  Pediatric Gamekeepers thumbs are usually Salter-Harris III lesions and are treated surgically if there is more than 2mm of displacement.
