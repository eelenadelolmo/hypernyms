13 Y/O AAF recently diagnosed with large ostium secundum atrial septal defect.
Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a congenital cardiac defect that occurs in 1:1500 live births and accounts for 6-10% of congenital cardiac defects.  ASD is twice as common in women than men.  ASD usually causes a left-to-right shunt since left atrial pressure is normally greater than rt atrial pressure. The amount of shunting depends on defect size and pressure difference.   Ostium secundum accounts for 80-90% of ASD and is due to embryologic underdevelopment of the septum secundum. Even though most patients with ASD are asymptomatic they are usually diagnosed in infancy after a murmur is noted on cardiac exam.   Childhood symptoms can include failure to thrive and recurrent pulmonary infections.  Adults may present with symptoms of congestive heart failure.  Signs of ASD depend on the size of the shunt and commonly include: rt ventricular impulse, fixed S2, and pulmonic flow murmur.  ECG and CXR findings vary with size of shunt and both may be normal with small defects.  Definitive diagnosis of ASD is made with echocardiography or cardiac catheterization, which show both the size and location of defect.   ASD may be treated with surgical closure or transcatheter devices.
