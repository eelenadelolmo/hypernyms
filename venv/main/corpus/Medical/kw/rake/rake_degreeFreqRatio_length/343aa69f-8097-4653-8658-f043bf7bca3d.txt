No labs.
Decreased ROM and crepitus on physical exam.
Referral to Orthopedics for evaluation.  If shoulder instability is found on exam, patient may benefit from shoulder stabilization surgery.
There is abnormal high T2 signal with corresponding T1 low signal in the anteromedial aspect of the humeral head. A small contour abnormality of the humeral head is also evident at the anteromedial portion indicating an impaction fracture. 

The posterior labrum is macerated, and the associated periosteal sleeve is avulsed from the posterior rim of the glenoid. Abnormal high signal extends to the superior posterior labrum.
Findings of posterior dislocation with reverse Hill-Sach's deformity and Reverse Bankhart's injury
Reverse Hill Sachs Lesion
Direct Impact Fracture
Posterior Labral Injury
Reverse Bankhart Injury
27 year-old man with persistent shoulder pain for 2 weeks following left shoulder contusion.
Patients are often unaware of the exact mechanism of their injuries.  In this case, the patient reported a recent contusion and ongoing pain; however, the findings are clearly the result of a posterior dislocation and relocation.
