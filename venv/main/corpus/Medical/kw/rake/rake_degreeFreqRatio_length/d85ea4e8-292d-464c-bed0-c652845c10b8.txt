PE:  Anterior shoulder instability
Surgical repair is warranted in this young patient with evidence of anterior instability (Bankart repair).
------------
In general, patients with traumatic unidirectional instability with a Bankart lesion often require surgical intervention.
XRAY:  Hill Sach deformity

MRI:  Hill Sach deformity, Bony Bankart lesion
Anterior shoulder dislocation/instability
Anterior Shoulder instability
24 Y/O male with recurrent anterior shoulder dislocations.
Fractures of the glenoid rim (bony Bankart lesion) are diagnostic of anterior instability when they are demonstrated on radiographs. However, not all anterior instabilities or recurrent dislocations are associated with an bony Bankart lesion. 

In addition, the presence of a Hill-Sach lesion is diagnostic of anterior instability and is seen in 50% of patients.  The Hill-Sach lesion describes a characteristic defect of the posterolateral surface of the humeral head, and represents a compression fracture.
