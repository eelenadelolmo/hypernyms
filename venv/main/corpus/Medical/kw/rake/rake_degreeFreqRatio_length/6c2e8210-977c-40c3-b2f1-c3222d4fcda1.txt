Texto: 
The patient was a 9kg male whose exam was significant for + inspiratory stridor and retrognathia.  Lab findings included a negative strep throat culture and a CBC with 18.5 WBC (26% monocytes, 12% myelocytes), RBC 3.1, Hgb 8.4, Hct 25.4, and Fibrinogen 64.1
Antibiotics and chemotherapy
Thickening  of  the  epiglottis,  aryepiglottic  folds  and  prevertebral soft  tissues
Epiglottitis secondary to AML- M5
•	Epiglottitis
•	Croup
•	Bronchiolitis
•	Bacterial Tracheitis
•	Uvulitis
•	Foreign body
•	Peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess
An 8 month old male presented to the ED with a 2 week history of fever, cough, increased hoarseness, increased work of breathing, and decreased po intake. The patient was taking Amoxicillin for otitis media,  without an improvement of his symptoms.
Epiglottitis is not commonly seen since the advent of the Haemophilus influenza vaccine.  However, this patient was susceptible to the disease secondary to being immunocompromised because of his AML.  Once his AML was identified and treated, the patient had a good recovery and prognosis.
