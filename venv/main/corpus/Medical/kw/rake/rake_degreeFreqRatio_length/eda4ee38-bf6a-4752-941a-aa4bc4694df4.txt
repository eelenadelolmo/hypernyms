Patient will continue to follow-up for cholangiogram and biliary stone removal as needed.
After accessing the Hutson-Russell cutaneous choledochojejunostomy loop, a glidewire and vascular sheath were passed into the biliary system allowing a cholangiogram to be performed which demonstrated numerous small filling defects consistent with stones within the left dorsal and ventral hepatic biliary system.  
The right biliary system was clear of stones. 
The entire biliary tract was diffusely mildly dilated. 
A short segment stenosis was noted within the left hepatic duct near the confluence of the right and left ducts. This was dilated with a 10 mm angioplasty balloon.
A Fogarty balloon was advanced into the left biliary systems, inflated, and retracted pulling the stones into the common bile duct. 
Post procedure cholangiogram reveled significant improvement in the left-sided stone burden and reduction of the stricture of the left hepatic duct.

Acute cholangitis is a bacterial infection superimposed on an obstruction of the biliary tree most commonly from a gallstone, but it may be associated with neoplasm or stricture. Recurrent pyogenic (Oriental) cholangiohepatitis is endemic in Southeast Asia.  It is a type of chronic recurrent cholangitis prevalent in coastal areas from Japan to Southeast Asia. In Hong Kong, it is the third most common indication for emergency laparotomy and the most frequent type of biliary disease. It is a recurrent form of pyogenic cholangitis with intrahepatic and extrahepatic stones in 70-80% of patients and cholelithiasis in 50-70%. Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis / oriental cholangiohepatitis rarely is observed in the US but may be observed in Asian populations.  Pathologically, the intra- and extrahepatic ducts are dilated and contain soft, pigmented stone and pus. There is proliferation of bile ducts and infiltration of inflammatory cells along the periportal spaces and hepatic parenchyma. Localized intrahepatic segmental ductal stenosis may be present, especially in the lateral segment of the left lobe or posterior segment of the right hepatic lobe. The cause of the disease is not known, but associations with clonorchiasis, ascariasis, and nutritional deficiency have been suggested. Currently, mortality ranges from 7-40%.
