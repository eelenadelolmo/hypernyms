Texto: 
There is note of a single small choroid plexus cyst.
The heart has a complex cardiac anomaly with a hypoplastic left heart, ventricular septal defect and a truncus arteriosus with early branching.
A small omphalocele is present - demonstrated by the echogenic area extending into the base of the cord - this is a small amount of herniated bowel
A seperate thin walled cyst is present on the umbilical cord near the fetal cord insertion.
There is also mild hydronephrosis of the left kidney seen.
Trisomy 18
Once a spectrum of anomalies are identified, the primary concern is for a chromosomal abnormality versus congential effects of a system disease - infectious vs teratogen.
second trimester screening ultrasound
A comment on choroid plexus cysts that differs some with the factoid.  Choroid plexus cysts are common.  They are seen in 1-2% of all normal pregnancies.  Size and number are not of significant prognostic indication.  The finding is either they have them or they don't.  While more tightly associated with trisomy 18, as trisomy 21 is so much more common, the likelihood is that if they are coexistent with a chromosomal abnormality, it is more likely for the fetus to have trisomy 21.  Once a choroid plexus cyst is identified, extra attention should be directed towards identifying a second abnormality.  This includes the addition of open hand images, an image that isn't a required portion of the anatomic scan.  The issue is that a persistent clenched fist may be the only associated anomaly wit the choroid plexus cyst in the setting of Trisomy 18.  The absence of an additional finding doesn't completely exclude a chromosomal abnormality but the likelihood is low.  As such, no additional workup of choroid plexus cysts are performed when they are isolated.  

A seperate note also.  Choroid plexus cysts often resolve during the course of the pregnancy - there is no utility in following them.  There resolution does not improve the risk to the fetus....it's the + or - associated abnormalities.
