12-lead EKG demonstrated marked ST elevations c/w an acute infarct.
During initial ER presentation patient became pulseless and was resuscitated for one hour, when a stable rhythm was established.
Noncontrast CT images demonstrate effacement of the the sulci. There is diffuse graying of the cerebral hemispheres with blurring and loss of normal gray-white differentiation and interface.  The ventricles are small. Note that the cerebellum and brainstem are well preserved and have a normal appearance.
Also note pansinusitis with air-fluid level in sphenoids.
Diffuse Cerebral Edema from cardiac arrest
Any anoxic or hypoxic events - to include drowning, strangulation
Closed Head Injury
(These findings can be normal in premature infants)
