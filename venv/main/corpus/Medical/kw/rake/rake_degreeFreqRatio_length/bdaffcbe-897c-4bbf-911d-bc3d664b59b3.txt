Left upper quadrant and chest wall tenderness.  Tachycardic and tachypneic.  Lab values are within normal limits.
In a hemodynamically stable patient with a splenic injury, the treatment is often conservative.  Generally, surgery can be avoided, unless there is uncontrolled hemorrhage causing hemodynamic instability.
A contrast enhanced CT of the abdomen reveals multiple, irregular, low density areas within the  parenchyma of the spleen.  There is a small amount of extracapsular blood anterior to the spleen as well as at the splenic hilum.
Splenic Laceration
In the setting of trauma, splenic laceration and/or hematoma is the only reasonable diagnosis.  Possible non-traumatic diagnoses may include splenic infarction, abscess, pancreatic pseudocyst, or lymphoma.
21 year-old male, struck in the left side while playing softball.  The patient complains of severe left chest, left shoulder and diffuse abdominal pain.
This patient did well with conservative treatment and did not require surgical intervention.  No follow-up imaging was performed.
