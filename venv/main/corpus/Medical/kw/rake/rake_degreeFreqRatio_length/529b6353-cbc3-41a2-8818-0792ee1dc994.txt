22yo AA male with known sickle cell disease presents with fever, cough for the last two days.
Although in this case the etiology of the event was infection, a similar chest radiograph could be secondary to many different causes.  Even if previous knowledge of sickle cell disease was not known, it can be suspected with the additional findings of humeral head infarcts and splenectomy.

Acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease can be defined as: a new infiltrate on chest x-ray in association with one or more new symptoms: fever, cough, sputum production, dyspnea, or hypoxia. This is a common complication of the sickling blood dyscrasias, including Hb SS, Hb SC, Hb S ?+-thalassemia, Hb S ?0-thalassemia, etc.  This complication occurs with an incidence of 10,500/100,000 patients per year.
Acute Chest syndrome occurs typically only once in a patient's life, more common in the younger population, usually 3-5yrs of age.  However, if more than one event occurs, significant mortality and morbity is associated with it.
The role of radiology is to track the evolution of chest findings.  Complications of acute chest syndrome include: pulmonary infarction, fat embolism syndrome, hypoventilation secondary to rib/sternal bone infarction, hypoventilation secondary to narcotic administration, and pulmonary edema induced by narcotics or fluid overload.
