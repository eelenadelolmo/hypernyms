Physical exam revealed decreased range of motion in the left knee greater on flexion & a moderate effusion without erythema or warmth. There was a tender mass palpable at the anterior medial and lateral joint lines. Arthrocentesis of the joint revealed gross blood but fluid analysis proved otherwise unremarkable. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, c-reactive protein, prothrombin time, & activated partial thromboplastin time were all within normal limits.
Surgical resection with post operative MR monitoring.
Radiographs: Bilateral weight-bearing anterior-posterior and lateral radiographs showed an increased density within the soft tissues of the left knee joint. The bones were well mineralized with smooth borders and no erosions.

MRI :T2 weighted with fat saturation MR images  of the left knee showed multiple low-signal-intensity masses in the anterior and posterior knee. There was a large high-signal-intensity effusion present on axial & sagittal T2 sequences. The presence of hemosiderin within the mass demonstrated a low-signal intensity rim and “blooming” artifact on gradient-recalled echo and was better delineated than on the T2 weighted images. There was no evidence of erosion or osseous infiltration on any sequence.

A 36 y/o Caucasian woman presented with a chief complaint of pain & swelling in her left knee for three months. She denied history of trauma or exercise. Her past medical history was non-contributory.  Review of systems is negative for fever, fatigue, adenopathy, weight loss, morning stiffness, or night pain.
