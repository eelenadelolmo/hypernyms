Fever, leukocytosis and diarrhea.
Abdominal exam limited.
n/a
Abdominal CT demonstrates diffuse colonic wall thickening and a shaggy endoluminal contour.  Mucosal and submucosal edema results in "accordian pattern" or "target sign."

22 year old male OIF patient s/p blast injury and several weeks of antibiotic therapy.
CT findings in this patient were consistent with a diagnosis of Pesudomembranous Colitis.  While the "accordian sign", produced by diffuse bowel wall thickening from mucosal and submucosal  edema, is not pathgnomonic for pseudo membranous colitis, it is highly suggestive of the diagnosis.  In this case, imaging findings were confirmed with fecal cultures.
