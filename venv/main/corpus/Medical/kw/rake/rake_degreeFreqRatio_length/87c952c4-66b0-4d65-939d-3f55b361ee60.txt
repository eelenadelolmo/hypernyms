Texto: 
Physical exam is remarkable only for S shaped scoliosis (right thoracic curve and left lumbar curve).
No abnormal laboratory findings.
En bloc surgical resection of T11 Osteoid Osteoma

Follow up: If symptoms recur
Standing AP and lateral thoracolumbar spine:
S-shaped thoracolumbar scoliosis. 16 degrees dextroscoliosis between T2 and T8.
33 degree levoscoliosis between T9 and L2. 19 degree
dextroscoliosis between L3 and L5

MRI of the thoracic spine: Mildly enhancing mass at the lamina of T11 on the right side which measures 2.7 x 1.3 x 2.0 cm. Likely originating in the soft tissue and
eroding into the pedicle. Corresponds to the apex of the
levoscoliosis. Edema present in right erector spinae musculature.

CT of the thoracic spine:
Area of abnormality on the MR is along the
lamina of the T11 vertebral body just medial to the inferior costal facet. There is a well-defined 1 cm lytic lesion with a bony nidus which demonstrates a large amount of benign appearing sclerotic bony
overgrowth in the surrounding bone.

Patient is a 15 year old Caucasian male who presented with several months of unrelenting back pain along with the development of scoliosis. Pain is reported to be worse during nighttime and no longer controlled with the use of NSAIDs.
