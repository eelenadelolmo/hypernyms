â€¢ AV fistula
â€¢ Enlarged Straight Sinus due to
Straight sinus aneurysm
â€¢ Pineal region neoplasm (germ cell tumor, pineal tumor)
â€¢ Deep venous hypertension:
Â» Dural AVM
Â» Pial (parenchymal) AVM
Â» Dural AVF
Â» Hypoplastic Distal Straight Sinus
4 year old boy with speech delay
This case is unusual because the AV fistual drains into the straight sinus rather than the Vein of Galen.  Because this is not a high output shunt the patient did not present with the usual findings of cardiac failure.
The lesion is thought to be asymptomatic
