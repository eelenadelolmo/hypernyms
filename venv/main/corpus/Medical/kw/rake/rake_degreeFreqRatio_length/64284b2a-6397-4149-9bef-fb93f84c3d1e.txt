Texto: 
Tenderness to palpation over the dorsum of the foot, with swelling and ecchymosis.
Surgery
Transverse, intrarticular fracture of the 2nd base metatarsal with lateral displacement of metatarsals 2-5.
Lisfranc Fracture-Dislocation
None
24yo male who fell from height of approximately 12 feet while intoxicated, presents with foot pain.
The most common dislocation of the foot, there are two main types of dislocation.  Homolateral, where the 1st metatarsal follows the remaining metatarsals, and divergent in which the 1st metatarsal is displaced medially, opposite to the remaining metatarsals.  Findings may be subtle at the early stages and is associated with diabetic neuropathic joint.
