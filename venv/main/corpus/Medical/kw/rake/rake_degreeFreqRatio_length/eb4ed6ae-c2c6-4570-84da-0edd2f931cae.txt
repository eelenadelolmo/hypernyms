Normal exam and normal labs
Surgical excision.
PA and lateral Chest:
Overlying the right hilum and extending superiorly along the right mediastinum, there is a mass with well defined convex lateral margin measuring approximately 7.0cm craniocaudad and 2.2cm right to left. On the lateral view this finding is seen in the posterior mediastinum.

CT scan of Chest with IV contrast:
There is a posterior mediastinal mass which is homogeneous, smoothly marginated and elliptical in shape without calcification. Hounsfield measurement is 24. No evidence of lung, bone or spine invasion.
Ganglioneuroma
Neurogenic tumor:
Schwannoma
Neurofibroma
Ganglioneuroma, Ganglioneuroblastoma or Neuroblastoma
Bronchogenic cyst
17 yo white female with history of Crohn disease, had a preoperative chest x-ray. Pt had no history of respiratory distress, smoking or congenital diseases.
Ganglioneuromas belong to the group of neurogenic tumors (others are Neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroblastoma) that usually arise from the primitive sympathetic neuroblasts of the sympathetic chain in the posterior mediastinum or can be associated with any autonomic nerve cells in any part of the body. 

Ganglioneuroma is a rare (1 in 100,000), benign tumor and is a highly differentiated form of neuroblastoma. It is commonly seen in young adults between the age of 10-40 and has a female predominance. They are slow growing, usually asymtomatic and are found incidentally on imaging. Rarely, they can secrete hormones and cause systemic symptoms due to endocrine activity.

On Chest x-ray, there is a solid tumor paraspinally which is well-circumbscribed and often contains flecks of calcification. It is hypoechoic on ultrasound and hypodense relative to muscle on CT and of intermediate signal on T1WI and high signal on T2 weighted  MRI. 

Treatment is usually surgical resection especially if symptomatic.
