Alert and oriented x3, communicative. No JVD. Bibasilar crackles in chest. Tachycardic with irregularly irregular rhythm. No rubs/murmurs. Soft, nontender, normoactive BS, no organomegaly. Pulses 2+/palpable. Tender right upper extremity with edema and slight erythema.
Since the patient was already started on lovenox for thrombotic prophylaxis, oral coumadin once a day was added to medication list for 4-5 days until she reaches therapeutic INR levels.
Compression ultrasonography with color duplex imaging of right upper extremity showed two brachial veins accompanying the brachial artery. At the point of distal brachial artery, the right brachial vein is noted to have a lumen with variable echogenicity. Compression view at the distal brachial veins shows incomplete collapse of the apposing walls of the right brachial vein. Color-flow of the right brachial vein shows a partial filling defect on longitudinal view and non-filling color flow on transverse view. Compression and color flow views of the right internal jugular, axillary, cephalic, basilic, and proximal brachial veins showed low echogenicity, compressible walls, and normal flow.
Upper Extremity DVT
* Upper extremity DVT
* Thrombophlebitis
* Cellulitis
* Lymphangitis, lymph obstruction 
* Venous insufficiency
82 yo female with history significant for HTN and hypothyroidism was admitted to WRAMC for one day of dyspnea associated with exertion. It was exacerbated by movement and alleviated with rest. Patient denied chest pain/jaw-arm numbness/diaphoresis/LOC. She was admitted for atrial fibrillation with right ventricular hypertrophy. Rate was controlled with metoprolol and IV labetalol. She was also given lovenox once daily for thrombotic prophylaxis. However, during hospital day 5, patient was found to have edema in her right upper extremity.
This patient had some of the major risk factors that increase the probability of having a DVT: she was over the age of 75 years and required intravascular access in order to receive a rate controlling medication. Normally, a person with a known reversible cause of DVT can stop coumadin after at least three months of treatment. Although there was an obvious and reversible cause for her right upper extremity DVT, the patient was also newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. Her treatment with coumadin should continue and maintain INR levels between 2-3 in order to prevent future thrombus formation. However, if she has an increased risk of falls, the risk of suffering a fatal cranial bleed becomes greater than the benefit of preventing an acute thrombotic event. In this case, removing coumadin after three months of treatment would be reasonable.
