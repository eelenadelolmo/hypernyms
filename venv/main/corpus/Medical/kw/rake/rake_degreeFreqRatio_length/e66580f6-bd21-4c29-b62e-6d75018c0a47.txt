Physical exam demonstrated enlarged right side of scrotum.
After diagnostic ultrasound, patient returned to emergency room where he received analgesics for pain.  Urology team successfully partially reduced torsion by rotating testicle 360 degrees within the scrotum while in the emergency dept.  Patient was then taken to surgery where an additional complete rotation was necessary for full blood flow restoration.  The testicle was salvadged.  Bilateral orhio-pexy was then performed.
Sonographic evaluation of testes demonstrate no flow in the right testicle.  A normal flow is present in the left testicle.  There is a small hydrocele around the superior pole of the right testicle.
Testicular Torsion
No ddx for testicle without flow.
Painful testicle ddx includes: orchitis/epididymitis, other findings of trauma such as hematoma.
11 year old African American boy was playing/jumping in the pool.  He started to feel pain in his scrotum that increased in severity.  Patient presented to emergency room 4 hrs after the initial onset of pain.
