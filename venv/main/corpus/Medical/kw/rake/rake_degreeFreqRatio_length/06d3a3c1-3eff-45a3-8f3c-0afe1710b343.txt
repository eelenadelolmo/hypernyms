Laboratory values significant for elevated glucose but otherwise normal.  Physical exam is unremarkable.
Her MRI of the brain was originally read as normal.  The patient returned to the ER status post fall at a later date.  At this time a CT of the head was ordered.  The abnormality was detected on the CT and then retrospectively seen on the MRI images.

This case does deserve some comment.  Usually, in a closed-lip schizencephaly, there is a dimple in the wall of the ventricle at the cleft.  In this case, the gray-matter seems to indent into the ventricle.  So what is it? It appears as to be a congenital problem with neuronal migration that may not be typical for schizencephaly.

On the MRI images a small track of grey matter extends laterally from the posterior right frontal lobe, superolateral surface, towards the midportion of the right lateral ventricle.  No evidence for CSF extension into the track.  This is best appreciated on the T2W sequences.  On the noncontrast CT images of the brain, there is a prominent sulcus along the lateral aspect of the right frontoparietal lobe with grey matter extending to the right lateral ventricle.  These findings are consistent with closed lip schizencephaly
Neuronal migration disorder - possibly a closed-Lip schizencephaly
Open-lip schizencepahly
Closed-lip schizencephaly
Porencephaly
Gray-matter heterotopia
52-year old woman with multiple medical problems presents to her primary care physician with complaint of worsening headaches.
Schizencephaly was an "incidental" finding in this patient.  Symptomatic patients with schizencephaly usually present in the 1st or 2nd decades with seizures, developmental delay, mental disability, or severe neurologic dysfunction - depending on the severity of the lesion.

This patient presented with the complaint of worsening headaches.  The age of this patient, with late presentation unrelated to the migration anomaly, is unusual.  The finding of closed-lip schizencephaly was originally difficult to detect on MRI, but is best appreciated on the T2W sequences.  Upon the patient's return for further imaging for an unrelated complaint, a CT was obtained.  The grey-matter lined cleft is obvious on the noncontrast head CT.
