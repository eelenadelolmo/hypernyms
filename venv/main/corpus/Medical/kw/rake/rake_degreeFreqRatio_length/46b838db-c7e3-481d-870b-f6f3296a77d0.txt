Beta HCG >2000 IU/L
Following sonographic evaluation, the patient was taken to the OR for surgical excision of the adnexal mass.
The uterus is shown to have normal echotexture, a normal endometrial stripe and demonstrates no evidence of an intrauterine pregnancy.
A complex, hyperechoic left adnexal mass is demonstrated on sonographic evaluation.
A hypoechoic left ovarian lesion consistent with a corpus luteum cyst is present.
Free fluid with internal echoes represents hemorrhage.
Ectopic pregnancy
Ectopic pregnancy
Heterotopic pregnancy
28 year old female presents with acute onset of pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding.
Imaging findings in the setting of a suspected ectopic pregnancy must be interpreted with respect to the patient's Beta-HCG results.  A Beta-HCG of greater than 2000 IU/L without a detectable intrauterine pregnancy (IUP)on transvaginal ultrasound (TV US) is highly suspicious for an ectopic pregnancy.  A quantitative Beta-HCG result of less than 1000 IU/L with no gestational sac demonstrated on TV US is non-diagnostic and should be followed with serial Beat-HCG's and/or repeat imaging.
    Ectopic pregnancy can present with several sonographic imaging findings.  Intrauterine findings include:
1. Normal Uterus
2. Thickened Endometrial Stripe
3. Decidual Cyst (Simple cysts seen in the periphery of the endometrium)
4. Pseudogestational Sac (a collection of fluid or hyperechoic material that distends the endometrial canal and can be differentiated from a gestational sac by its more elongated appearance suggesting conformity to the endometrial canal.)
    Extrauterine findings which confer a 100% positive predictive value (PPV) for diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy include demonstration of either an extrauterine embryo with heart motion or an adnexal mass with a yolk sac.  An adnexal ring surround a fluid collection carries a 95% PPV for ectopic while a complex or solid adnexal mass provides 92% PPV.  The finding of free fluid within the pelvis may also be seen indicating hemorrhage.
    Several risk factors which predispose patients to ectopic pregnancy should be kept in mind.  Patient's with abnormal fallopian tubes secondary to previous infection or surgery, those with normal tubes but on ovulation-inducing drugs, in-vitro fertilization, or with IUD's, and patients with a prior ectopic pregnancy are all at increased risk for the development of ectopic pregnancy.
