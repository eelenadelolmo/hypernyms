- Normal BP
- Asymmetric face with right hemifacial microsomia
- Larger right eye 
- Bilateral epibulbar dermoids (temporal region) affecting vision 
- Absent right ear and sensorineural hearing loss, uses sign language 
- Normal left ear with preauricular pits
- Nose deviated to the left 
- Cleft palate unrepaired, cleft lip repaired, asymmetric teeth
- Tracheostomy dependent 
- Heart: systolic ejection murmur
- Gastric feeding tube 
- Straight spine with mild sacral dimple 
- Undescended testes 
- Uncoordinated gait, alert and cooperative
Multidisciplinary approach required due to the wide range of anomalies:
- Followed up by a range of specialists including: cardiologists, pulmonary physician, developmental pediatricians, pediatric surgeons (cardiac , ENT, general, plastics), nephrologist, neurologist
- Genetic counseling 
- Allied health professions such as speech therapists
CT head, neck and chest were performed to rule out vascular aneurysm. Although no evidence of aneurysm was found, this child has multiple congenital anomalies including: 
- CT Neck and Head: absence of the right ear and external auditory canal, absence of the right internal auditory canal, abnormal positioning of the cochlea adn semicircular canals in the temporal bone, absence of right mastoid air cells, hypoplasia of the right maxillary sinus and cleft palate, hypoplasia fo the right mandibular condyle and absence of multiple teeth, fusion of C5-C6
- CT Chest: compression of left main bronchus (from coarctation of aorta), rib deformities
Oculo-Auriculo-Vertebral Syndrome (OAVS)
Although over 90% of isolated cleft palate cases are non-syndromic, cleft lip with or without cleft palate has over 300 associated syndromes. OAVS is one of the most common of these associated syndromes.
Born at 33 weeks gestation, induced labor with premature ROM, vaginal delivery, and known cleft lip and palate prior to birth. Spent 4 months in NICU following his birth.

ASD, VSD and coarctation of the aorta repaired at 12 weeks of age. Also developed complete heart block requiring a permanent pacemaker. Tracheostomy required for compression of his left mainstem bronchus from the coarctation. 

He has a right congenital ear anomaly and resultant speech and language delay.
This patient was diagnosed with Goldenhar Syndrome shortly after delivery. 

His treatment issues are outlined below:

1. Cardiac: Initial surgical repair of ASD, VSD and coarctation of aorta 12 days after birth (ASD and VSD closed, coarctation repaired with end to end anastomosis). The patient then developed complete heart block and required placement of an epicardial ventricular pacemaker. Re-obstruction of his coarctation repair site occurred and he underwent cardiac catheterization with balloon dilatation at 6 months of age. 

2. Pulmonary: Due to the compression of his left main stem bronchus he is dependent on his tracheostomy tube. His asthma is managed with the inhalers fluticasone and albuterol. 

3. ENT: His cleft lip was repaired but cleft palate has not been repaired to date. His hearing is assisted with a left sided hearing aid.
 
4. GUT:  At 10 years of age he was circumcised and had his undescended testes brought down. 

5. Social / developmental: attends school for half days, uses sign language to communicate

6. GIT: gastrostomy tube for feeds 

7. MSK: ambulation difficulties with bilateral pronation 

8. Ophthalmic: Bilateral epibulbar dermoids with ptosis of the right eye and vision impairment.
