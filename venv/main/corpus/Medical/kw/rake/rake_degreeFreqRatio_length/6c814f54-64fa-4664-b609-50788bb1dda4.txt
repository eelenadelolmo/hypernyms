No palpable difference between right and left breast.  No nodularity or tenderness.
None planned.  Breast implant removal/replacement is optional.
High attenuation material (silicone) is noted extending into the breast tissue surrounding the implant on both MLO and CC views.  Because the silicone extends with irregular margins beyond the smoothly marginated fibrous capsule, this is diagnostic of extracapsular rupture.
Extracapsular silicone breast implant rupture
None
