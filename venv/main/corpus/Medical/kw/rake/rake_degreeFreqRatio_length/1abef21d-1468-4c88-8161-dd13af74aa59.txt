Medial joint line tenderness and + McMurray
Bucket-handle tears are generally unstable and may be resected or repaired depending on the complexity
-ACL graft (not completely shown) was intact
-longitudinal medial meniscal tear with displacement of the inner fragment into the intercondylar notch consistent with a bucket-handle type meniscal tear
-small joint effusion
Bucket-handle medial meniscal tear
1) Bucket-handle medial meniscal tear
27 y/o male with prior ACL reconstruction has reinjury of knee with medial joint line pain and locking.
One should only see two structures in the intercondylar notch (the ACL and PCL).  In this case, on the sagital Proton density, one can see the "double PCL sign" and indicator of a displaced inner fragment of the bucket-handle tear.
