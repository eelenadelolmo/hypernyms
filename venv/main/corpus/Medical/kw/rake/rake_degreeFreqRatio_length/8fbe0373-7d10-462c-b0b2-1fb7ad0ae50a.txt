The pt reports no fever, cough, SOB, or hemoptysis. The pts social history is significant for a smoking 1/2 PPD for the past 5 years.
Left pneumothorax (Upper Chest)
Left upper lobe pneumothorax
Pt is a 19 yo man in his state of otherwise excellent health until he noted the acute onset of a sharp stabbing sensation in his left chest while he was welding. The pt had been experiencing some bilateral chest pain which was associated with lifting weights. He noted that the acute pain was significantly different than that associated with his weight lifting. The pt continued to weld and then went on a five mile road march that afternoon. During the march the pt continued to note pain upon deep inspiration.
Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs spontaneously in a person without underlying pulmonary disease. It is more common in men than in women and almost all individuals are smokers. The characteristic pt is a tall thin man between 20 and 40 years of age. This pt was 6' tall and weighed 160 pounds. Pneumothorax is generally due to the rupture of a pulmonary or subpleural bleb or bulla into the pleural space. It may develop when excessive stress is placed on a weakened area of pleura. In many patients no underlying pathology can be determined. The recurrence rate varies from 20-50% over the next 5 years.

Patients most often complain of chest pain on the affected side and dyspnea. Pneumothorax can be life threatening if a tension pneumothorax develops or the pt becomes significantly hypoxic. There may be cough and/or hemoptysis.

If pneumothorax is suspected and not seen on the traditional inspiratory film than an expiratory film can be obtained since the constant volume of the pneumothorax is more evident when the size of the hemithorax decreases with inspiration

The option of observation may be exercised if the pneumothorax involves less than 15 to 20 % of the hemithorax , is stable, and the pt is asymptomatic. The air in the pleural space may gradually reabsorb at the rate of 1.25% per 24 hour period. Observation was chosen for this pt with repeat films to insure that the pneumothorax was indeed resolving. The administration of 02 increases the rate of absorption of pleural air. Tube thoracostomy may be necessary in larger pneumothorax or if the pt is symptomatic or experiencing an increase in the size of the pneumothorax.
