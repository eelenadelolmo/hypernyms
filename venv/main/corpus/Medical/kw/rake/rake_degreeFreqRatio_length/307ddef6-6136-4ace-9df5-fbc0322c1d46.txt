Neurological and physical exam were within normal limits. 
No significant laboratory findings.
The patient's symptoms did not abate and she ultimately had the lesion excised after embolization.
Gadloinium enahaced MRI of the bran demonstated a well circumscribed nodular extraaxial mass lesion within the left temporal region that demonstrated homogeneous enhancement. Additionally, no evidence of diffusion abnormality was present. Finally, small linear projections (i.e. "dural tails" were present at the periphery of this lesion).
Meningioma
Meningioma
Metastatic Disease
Arachnoid Cyst (unlikely here since no restricted diffusion was present)
53 year old female with history of dull headaches that have been progressively increasing in frequency and duration.
Although meningioma's are histologically benign entities, they can sometimes cause mass effect which can lead to serious patient symptomology which can lead to surgical intervention.
