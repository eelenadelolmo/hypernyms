Texto: 
Well developed/well nourished white male.
Diminished left radial and brachial pulses.
Neurologic exam is normal.
Blood pressure is 30 mmHg greater in right arm than left
He was treated with angioplasty and stenting after receiving 100 Units/kg of unfractionated heparin. Post stent placement, upper extremity blood pressures were equal.
The flush thoracic aortagram (with the catheter from below) shows a concentric stenosis in the proximal left subclavian artery without ante-grade flow into the ipsilateral vertebral artery. 

The next image, that is delayed, shows retrograde contrast filling of the left subclavian artery from the vertebral artery.

The final image, that is after angioplasty and stent, shows a normal diameter proximal left subclavian artery lumen and normal ante-grade flow into the subclavian artery as well as the vertebral artery.
Subclavian Stenosis with angiographic evidence of Subclavian  Steal Syndrome
Subclavian Steal Syndrome etiologies:
- ASVD
- Vasculitis
- Trauma
45 year old cook who complains of left arm/hand "numbness" and "heaviness" that is present with activity. He denies vertigo when exercising the left arm, although he admits that his symptoms have caused him to curtail his activities.
This patient had left subclavian steal syndrome from a proximal subclavian stenosis. This was seen during angiography with delayed retrograde filling of the subclavian artery from the vertebral artery.   

The patient had diminished pulses of the left arm as well as subjective weakness/heaviness/fatigue of that arm which can be seen in patients with this condition.

As discussed in the factoid, patients usually respond well to angioplasty/stenting and the 3 year patency is approximately 90%. Patients may present with claudication, pain, or posterior fossa symptoms such as vertigo. 

This patient was symptom free at 2 week followup.
