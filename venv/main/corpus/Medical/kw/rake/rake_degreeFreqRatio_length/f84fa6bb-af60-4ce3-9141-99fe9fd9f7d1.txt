â€¢ Trauma with fracture and cord contusion
74 year old man in motor vehicle accident, presents in the ER with no motor strength in his arms or legs.
In patients with rigid spines (DISH, Ankylosis Spondylitis, etc.) fractures through the disk spaces (rather than vertebral body) are more common than in patients whose spines are normal prior to trauma.
