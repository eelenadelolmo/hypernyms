Remarkable findings:
Heart/vasculature:
â€¢Blood pressure: 151/72
â€¢Pulse: 85 bpm
â€¢Prominent and pulsatile right carotid
â€¢Regular rate/rhythm with 2 to 3 x 6 diastolic murmur
Continue regular visits with cardiologist and primary care physician.
â€¢MRI Heart w/contrast

Remarkable findings:
â€¢Mildly dilated LV; normal systolic function, EF 70%
â€¢Moderate aortic regurgitation with flow quantitiation showing regurgitant fraction of 25%
â€¢Aortic root and ascending aorta are diffusely dilated; aortic dilation extends up to aortic arch
â€¢Brachiocephalic trunk is aneurismal measuring maximally at 2.5cm
â€¢Ectasia also involves proximal portion of right common carotid artery
â€¢Left common carotid artery has fusiform aneurysms in proximal segment before bifurcation
â€¢Subclavian artery has a high-grade stenosis immediately after origin of left internal mammary artery
â€¢Some pericardial effusion
â€¢Moderately dilated main pulmonary artery

Late gadolinium enhancement:
â€¢Subepicardial myocardial enhancement off inferior and inferolateral wall
â€¢No myocardial infarction
Takayasu arteritis
Takayasu arteritis
Giant cell arteritis
Fibromuscular dysplasia
Conective tissue disorder
This patient was a 43 year old Asian American woman with a history of aortic insufficiency and ascending aortic aneurysm as well as right innominate aneurysm. Patient also has past medical history of panic disorder.
