H-shaped vertebral bodies typical of those found in patients with sickle cell disease.
Sickle cell crisis is treated with fluid, and pain control.
H-shaped thoracic vertebral bodies with sclerotic and depressed endplates.
Findings on CXR in sickle cell disease
Other sources of chronic bone infarcts such as a hypercoagulable state or other hemaglobinopathies.
Patient with known sickle cell disease presented with worsening back pain.
The H-shaped vertebral bodies are classic for the appearance of chronic bone infarcts within the vertebral bodies.  There was no evidence of a new compression fracture.
