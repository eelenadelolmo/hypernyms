Normal gray matter/white matter differentiation. The structures of the supratentorial space and posterior fossa are developmentally normal. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or midline shift.

There is a T2 bright, nonenhancing soft tissue density in the left anterior ethmoid, which appears to be contiguous with brain parenchyma on some but not all the sequences, which are again limited by motion artifact. There is no evidence of orbital involvement. Specifically, the soft tissue density appears to be contiguous on axial T2, but it is not clearly contiguous on sagittal T1, but also appears to be contiguous on coronal T2 thin cuts. The pneumatied portions of the skull are otherwise unremarkable.

Impression:
Soft tissue density in the anterior left ethmoid air cell, which appears to be contiguous with brain prarenchyma on several of the sequences.

Recurrent chronic facial pain and nasal congestion with post-nasal drip.
An encephalocele is a cystic congenital malformation in which CNS structures, in communication with CSF fluid pathways, herniate through a defect in the cranium. If the herniation contains only CSF and meninges, it is an cranial meningocele, or more commonly, a meningocele. If it contains neural tissue, it is called a encephalomeningocele. An encephalocele that contains portions of the ventricle in the herniated sac is called an encephalocystocele. Occipital are more common in Europe and North America (66-90%) while sincipital ones prevail in Southeast Asia, Malaysia, and Russia.

Anterior encephaloceles are quite distinct from posterior lesions. The facial defect is usually covered with normal skin and hydrocephalus is unusual. Virtually all of these lesions contain dysplastic neural tissue.

There are three basic classes of anterior encephaloceles: frontal, sincipital, and basal. Frontal lesions often involve the corpus callosum and contain lipomatous, connective, and dysplastic neural tissue. Basal encephaloceles occur within the ethmoidal and sphenoidal bones.

Sincipital lesions are located in the fronto-midface junction and may bay affect olfactory or optic nerves, hypothalamus, mesencephalon, and temporal lobes. Of sincipital lesions, the nasaofrontal is the most common type; nasoethmoidal and nasoorbital are rarer forms of these lesions.
