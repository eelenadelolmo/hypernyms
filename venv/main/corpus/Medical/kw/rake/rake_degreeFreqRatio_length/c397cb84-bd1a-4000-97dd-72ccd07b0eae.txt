Ext - within normal limits
Therapeutic thoracentesis as needed for symptomatic relief of dyspnea.
PA and lateral views of the chest are provided. There is an apical pneumothorax on the left. There is an air-fluid level also seen high in the left hemithorax, consistent with a hydropheumothorax. There is atelectasis and probable volume loss in the left lung base. Patchy airspace disease in the right lung base. There is interstitial prominence in the right upper lobe, likely representing scar with emphysematous changes. The heart size is prominent. There is evidence of previous CABG with scarring and surgical clips.
