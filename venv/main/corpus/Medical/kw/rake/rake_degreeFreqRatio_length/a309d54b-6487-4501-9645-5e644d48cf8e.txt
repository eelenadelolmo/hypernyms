GEN: WNWD.  
Mental Status: awake, responsive, alert and oriented X 3.   
Head/Neck: normocephalic, supple without masses.
Eyes: See neuro exam.  
Ears Clear TMâ€™s, normal canals.  
Nose/Sinuses: Normal.  
Throat/Mouth/Teeth: Normal.  
Chest/Lungs: Equal BS, no rales, ronchi, wheezes or rubs.  
Heart: No gallops, rubs or murmurs.  
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, normal BS, no organomegaly.  
Male genitalia: Normal phallus, bilaterally descended testes with normal size, position, and consistency, no inguinal hernia.  
Back: Nornal.  
Neuro: Bright, articulate, inquisitive, fluent speech, excellent math and recall             Reflexes symmetric, no pathologic reflexes EOMI, PERRL, bilat papilladema, ou 20/20, face symmetry, gag symmetry, corneal reflex intact  Mild hypesthesia in right face. No pronator drift, symmetric strength  Bilat UE intention tremor, dysmetria, and dysdiadochokinesis Bilat LE normal gait, no dysmetria, normal tandem walk
Extremeties: no clubbing, cyanosis or edema. 
Skin: No lesions, no petechiae, no decubiti
Ventricular catheter placed in OR.  New symptoms resolved after placement of catheter.  Subsequent studies have demonstrated significant decrease in ventricular size since catheter placement.  Other follow-up unknown.
Symmetric severe dilation of the third and lateral ventricles.  Fourth ventricle is of normal size and contour.  There is obliteration of Sylvian aqueduct by an enlarged and convex portion of the superior tectal plate.   There is no reliable evidence of parenchymal enhancement here or otherwise.  There is a linear increased FLAIR signal noted around the lateral ventricles suggestive of transependymal pressure or CSF flow.  The orbits, skull base and pituitary fossa are all WNL.  Normal intracranial flow void seen
Obstructive Hydrocephalus (at level of Sylvian aqueduct)
Obstructive hydrocephalus resulting from stenosis at the aqueduct of Sylvius.  Although the stenosis may be congenital the images suggest a low grade neoplasm of the tectal plate.
Pt is a 10 y/o bright male with a h/o developmental tremor and some degree of gait asymmetry/ right toe flat walking with a short h/o new onset severe headache with associated loss of balance leading to fall, no LOC.  Previous hx unknown.
