Skin Dimple in midline just above buttocks.
No hairy patch or CSF leak
Unknown
• Tethered Spinal Cord
• Conus noted to be at the lower L3 level
• Dermal Sinus tract present in midline at L4 level and extending inferiorly to enter spinal canal at S1/ S2 level
• Occult dysraphism with failure of closure of L5 posterior elements
Tethered Cord due to Dorsal Dermal Sinus
• Lipoma
• Myelomeningocele
• Dermal sinus
• Diastametamyelia
4 month old baby boy with a history of birth asphyxia.
A dimple was noted in midline lower back just above buttocks.
Dorsal dermal sinuses result from a focal area of nondysjunction of the neural and cutaneous ectoderm during the formation of the neural tube (neurualtion). This results in a thin epithelial lined channel that extends inward from the skin surface for varying distances. Penetration into the the spinal canal occurs in up to 70% of cases.

Dermal sinuses are typically midline, but may be paramedian.  A skin dimple is present, and any dimple above the gluteal fold must be presumed to extend into the spinal canal until proven otherwise. The dimple is requently associated with a hairy or hyperpigemented patch, or capillary angioma.

Patients may become symptomatic due to  infection or by compression of neural structures by an associated dermoid or epidermoid.    A chemical meningitis may result from rupture of the dermoid or epidermoid.

T1 and T2-weighted sequences may demonstrate the sinus tract coursing obliquely through the subcutaneous tissues. If the tract extends intrathecally it may be difficult to visualize on MRI. CT myelography may help demonstrate the intrathecal component.
