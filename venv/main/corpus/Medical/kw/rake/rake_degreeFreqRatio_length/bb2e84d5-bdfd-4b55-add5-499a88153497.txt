Neurologically intact.
No treatment is needed for uncomplicated congenital absence of the corpus callosum.  If there was obstructive hydrocephalus, seizures, or other neurologic complications, treatment might be necessary
Sagittal T1, axial T2 and proton density-weighted images do not visualize the corpus callosum; and, there is associated colpocephaly.  There is absence of the cingulate gyrus and a radial pattern of sulci and gyri along the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere.  

Probst bundles are not well demonstrated on these images and would be best seen in  the coronal plane.  

The lateral ventricles demonstrate their classic wide and straight appearance.

Of note, there is also a large incidental subarachnoid cyst in the occipital region posterior to the cerebellum.
Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum
Broadly - including the colpocephaly:
1.Corpus Callosum Agenesis/dysgenesis
2.Hydrocephalus
3.Arnold Chiari malformation
4.Dandy Walker malformation
This 60 year old man presents with a 4 month history of left side numbness, decreased sensation, and pain in the V2/V3 distribution of his face.  There is no prior history of any neurologic problem.
In this patient, the congenital absence of the corpus callosum was an unexpected finding.
