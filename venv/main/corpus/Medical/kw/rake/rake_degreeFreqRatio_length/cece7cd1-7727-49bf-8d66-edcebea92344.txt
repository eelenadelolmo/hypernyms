Texto: 
Large, firm, non-mobile mass over left superior buttocks. Non-tender to palpation. Left hip with full range of motion. 5/5 strength throughout. Intact sensation.
The patient underwent surgical excision without complication. Pathology confirms the diagnosis of osteochondroma. After several weeks of recovery, the patient returned to full activity.
7.8 x 7.1 cm dense irregular shaped lesion projecting over the left iliac wing. Heterogeneous appearance with densely sclerotic areas suggestive of osteoid matrix.
Osteochondroma of Left Iliac Wing
Osteosarcoma, Chondrosarcoma, Multiple hereditary exostoses, Osteoblastoma, Enchondroma.
A 22-year-old man presented stating that his girlfriend noticed a large bump on his left hip last week. He denies pain, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, or fatigue.
Osteochondromas are cartilage-capped bony projections that arise on the external surface of bone and contain a continuous marrow cavity with the underling bone. These bony masses are usually discovered incidentally in the first and second decade of life in the metaphysis of long bones and are most commonly found in the distal femur, proximal tibia and proximal humerus. However, they may arise from any bone including flat bones like the pelvis or scapula. Osteochondromas are the most common benign bone tumor with a reported prevalence between 0.44% and 3.0%. Osetochondromas make up 35% of benign bone tumors and 8% of all bone tumors. They are slow growing tumors and rarely transform into malignancy, with a transformation rate of 1%. Osteochondromas with a cartilage cap greater than 1.5 to 2.0 cm or that continue to grow after skeletal maturity raise suspicion for malignant transformation. Osteochondromas are normally asymptomatic and no treatment is necessary but surgical excision is often performed if symptoms develop due to impingement of nerves, vessels, or tendons, for cosmetic reasons, or for concern of malignant transformation.
