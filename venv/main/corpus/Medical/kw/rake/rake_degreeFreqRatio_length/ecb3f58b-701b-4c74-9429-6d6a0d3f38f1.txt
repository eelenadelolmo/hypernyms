Excision of lesions with revision of femoral prosthesis.
Two lytic lesions within distal diaphysis of left femur; increased radiotracer accumulation within the lesions on bone scan and hypervascular on angiography.
Perfusion to the lesions obliterated with polyvinyl alcohol particles.
Skeletal metastasis
73 year old female with history of renal cell carcinoma, status post left total knee arthroplasty, presents with left leg pain.
In this case, highly likely lesions pathologic given history of RCCA and their appearance (lytic, hypervascular) and location.
