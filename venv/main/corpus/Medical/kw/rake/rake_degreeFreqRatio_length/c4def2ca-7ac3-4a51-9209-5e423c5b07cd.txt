Well developed, well nourished adolescent male in no acute distress.  Can bear full weight with both lower extremities despite visible pain.  Palpation and manipulation does not localized pain in right upper leg on exam.

No labs.
In most instances pain is the only adverse effect of the tumor.  Aspirin and NSAIDs can be used if surgery is not an option.  Rarely is there are secondary pathologic consequences in young children with spine or joint oriented tumors.  But, because the pain itself can be disabling and spontaneous regression over years is unpredictable, operative treatment is often recommended.  Most recently radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has gained acceptance as the treatment of choice for this condition.  It has replaced open surgery because it has far fewer complications and a much shorter recovery period.  

Generally this procedure is performed under spinal or local anesthetic and the lesion is identified under CT guidance.  Once the electrode is introduced into the lesion it is heated up to 85-90 degrees Celsius for 6 minutes and then withdrawn.   Patients treated with RFA are usually pain free within 2-3 days and are advised to avoid running or jumping for 3 months.
Plain film x-rays demonstrate an oval area of lucency within the right femoral cortex surrounded by an increased periosteal reaction.

CT of the right lower extremity demonstrates a cortically based oval lucency (nidus) surrounded by sclerotic bone.
Osteoid Osteoma confirmed by radiographic appearance and clinical history

15 year old white male presents with three month history of right upper leg pain that is unrelieved by rest.  Pain reportedly is worse at night and is somewhat relieved by NSAIDs.  There is no history of trauma or potential for overuse injury.
This patient underwent radiofrquency ablation of this lesion with complete symptomatic relief.
