Mild inspiratory and expiratory wheeze and bibasilar rales.
Patients are treated with bronchdilators to  stop bronchspasm.  Additionallly, anti-biotics are used to prevent a consolidative process.
PA and Lateral radiographs demonstrate hyperinflation with partial flattening of the hemidiaphragms.  The is bibasilar airway wall thickening without focal airspace consolidation or parenchymal destruction.
Chronic Bronchitis
Chronic bronchitis
Bronchiectasis
Viral bronchitis
65 yo female with recurrent productive cough that has exacerbated over the last 2 weeks.  No fever or chills. Patient has a 20 pack year history.
The diagnosis of chronic bronchitis is based upon the presence of chronic cough without a specific cause such as a chronic or acute infection, or bronchiectasis.  The PA close up view of the right base and Lateral close up view of the posterior bases demonstrate airway wall thickening with subtle tram tracks.    Also, there are no areas of cystic spaces with thin walls or parenchymal destruction to suggest bronchiectasis. The culmination of these findings with the appropriate history is suggestive of chronic bronchitis.
