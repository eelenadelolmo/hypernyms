followed by CT over a 10 month period with stability over time.
The right adrenal gland is enlarged and demonstrates a
heterogeneous attenuation.  A foci of fat attenuated region is noted within this adrenal lesion.  The right adrenal gland measures 3.2cmx2.7cmx3.0cm.
Adrenal Mass - considered to be benign lesion with stability over 10 months of imaging. Likely myelolipoma given imaging characteristics.
Higher on list despite focal fat: metastases
other: Myelolipoma, adenoma, paraganglioma, ganglioneuroma, pseudotumor
Post op day #14 status post emergency total
colectomy for large bowel obstruction for stage III colon cancer.  The patient was re-admitted for intractable vomiting and elevated white blood
cell count.
This case, as originally seen, was more suspicious for metastases given patients history of Colon CA. However, the lesion remained stable over time.
