Home exercise, physical therapy, oral bisphosphonates, calcitonin, NSAIDS, and analgesics are the mainstays of treatment.  Untreated patients should get alkaline phosphatase levels and radiographs annually while treated patients should get alkaline phosphatase levels every 3-4 months with radiographs annually.
AP Pelvis:  Coarsened and thickened trabeculae along the right femoral neck and greater trochanter.

Axial CT images through the right hip and pelvis:  Thickened trabecular markings with thickening of cortical bone along the right femoral neck and greater trochanter.  Areas of increased sclerosis are also present along the right femoral neck and greater trochanter.
Paget Disease of Bone
Paget's Disease
Osteosclerotic Bone Metastases
62 y.o. woman for metastatic skeletal survey for Paget disease.
The patient in this case is over 40 years of age and Paget disease of bone affects approximately 3-4% of the population over 40 years of age.  The proximal femur was affected in this patient.  The pelvis is affected in 30-75% of cases while the proximal long bones are affected in 25-30% of cases. Other frequent sites of involvement include the skull (25-65% of cases) and spine (30-75%).  Pelvic involvement is more often asymmetric than symmetric, and appendicular involvement is frequently unilateral as in this case.

The early phase of Paget disease is characterized by osteolysis on radiographs.  When this occurs in the skull, it is referred as osteoporosis circumscripta.  Paget disease usually affects the inner table of the skull more than the outer table.  This is in contradistinction to fibrous dysplasia thataffects the outer table more than the inner table.  In long bones, osteolysis begins as a subchondral lucency likened to a blade of grass or flame.

The next phase of Paget disease is the mixed phase.  The characteristic manifestations are coarsening and thickening of the trabecular pattern and cortex.  Paget disease of the pelvis usually manifests with cortical thickening and sclerosis of the iliopectineal and ischiopubic lines.  The findings are often asymmetric and more commonly seen on the right side.  Within the spine, osteoblastic activity is seen on all four margins of the vertebral body with a “picture frame appearance” unlike the rugger jersey vertebrae in renal osteodystrophy which only involves only the superior and inferior endplates.

The blastic phase is the next phase of Paget disease.  In the long bones and pelvis, areas of sclerosis may develop and can be extensive obliterating areas of previous trabecular thickening.  Bone enlargement is common in this phase.  The skull can have a “cotton wool” appearance while the spine can show an ivory vertebral body on radiography.

Bone scintigraphy typically demonstrates marked increased uptake of radionuclide in all phases of the disease.  In the quiescent late phase of the disease, radionuclide activity may be normal with persistent abnormalities seen on radiographs.  Patients with normal bone scans and abnormal radiographic findings are almost always asymptomatic with regard to Paget disease.

CT may show areas of lysis with loss of normal trabeculae.  Cortical and trabecular thickening are well demonstrated as well.  Areas of sclerosis are also seen in the blastic phase.

MRI often shows maintenance of the yellow marrow.  Bone enlargement as well as trabecular and cortical thickening have low signal on all MR pulse sequences.   In the lytic or mixed active phase, the marrow has decreased signal intensity on T1 and heterogeneous high signal intensity on T2.  The increased blood flow in Paget disease is reflected as increased enhancement with Gadolinium.

Complications from Paget disease include osseous weakening (deformity and fracture), arthritis, neurologic symptoms, and sarcomatous transformation which occurs in 1% of cases.  Sarcomatous transformation is seen on images as focal bone destruction extending through the cortex with an associated soft tissue mass.
