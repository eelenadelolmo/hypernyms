Vitals: BP 118/73, P 133, RR 22, Temp 36.0
ABD: Tenderness to deep palpation elicited in periumbilical and LLQ.
Intussusception was successfully reduced by air contrast enema.
An inflammatory juvenile polyp, likely the lead point, was removed colonoscopically.
Plain radiographs: distended loops of bowel in ascending and transverse colon. No air in left colon and rectum.   
Longitudinal ultrasound: shows submarine sandwich-like appearance of the intussuscipiens and the intussusceptum. There appear to be multiple layers, which represent the walls of the intussuscepted bowel loops. Transverse ultrasound: shows a mass with a swirled appearance of alternating sonolucent hyperechoic bowel wall of the loop-within-a-loop. 
CT scan: shows classic “target sign”
Air enema: intussusceptum in mid descending colon and lead point proximal to splenic flexture. 
Colonoscopy: identified a large polypoid, which was subsequently removed.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Two month history of dull, mild periumibilical pain with intermittent spells of severe sharp pain lasting 20 minutes. Three days of intermittent sharp pain and currant jelly stools. Vomiting x 24 hours, with five episodes of emesis, ultimately bilious.
Intussusception, a potentially lethal condition with poorly understood etiology, is the most common cause of acute intestinal obstruction in children younger then 5 years old. Success is more likely to be achieved in patients with idiopathic intussusception, although it can be accomplished in patients with a recognized lead point. In addition, success is less likely to be achieved in infants younger than one year of age, in children older than five years of age, when plain films show signs of intestinal obstruction and when symptoms have been present for longer than 48 hours.

This case is unique because intussusception most commonly occurs at the ileocecal valve with ileum being drawn into the cecum.  The plain films in these cases often show a paucity of bowel gas or a soft tissue mass in the right lower quadrant. In this patient however, the transverse colon is clearly air filled and the paucity of bowel gas is noted in the descending colon.  Given this patient's age and the unexpected plain film findings suggesting a colo-colic location, a lead point was suspected.  After successful reduction using air, an air contrast BE was used to prove this suspicion.  Most cases with a lead point require surgical repair, but in this case colonscopy was successful to remove the lead point.
