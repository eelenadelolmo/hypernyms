Texto: 
Physical exam remarkable for ventricular septal defect noted on cardiac echo.  Patient has trisomy 21 features.
The patient is awaiting surgery. The surgeons were aware of the hernia in the newborn period, but are waiting for the child to mature before undertaking a surgical repair.
Newborn films and those taken at 4 months old demonstrate bowel loops extending above the diaphragm anteriorly and to the left of the heart.  The loops are more prominent on the 4 month radiographs.  The heart is displaced to the right on the 4 month radiographs as well.
