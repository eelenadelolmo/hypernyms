PHYSICAL EXAM: Swirled and pigmented patterns distributed over trunk following Blaschko's lines. Verrucous plaques are present over lower legs and feet.
LABORATORY: CBC-WBC 18.5 (6-17.5) Eos-2%
HISTOPATHOLOGY: Hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and dyskeratosis within the epidermis. Dermal pigmentary incontinence is also present. Epidermal spongiosis and vesicle formation are present. Mild vacuolar changes are present along the basal layer. Eosinophils are present within the vesicles as well as scattered throughout the epidermis and dermis.
Genetic counseling and ophthalmologic monitoring.
INCONTINENTIA PIGMENTI - VERRUCOUS STAGE (1997 Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, Case#8) Diane Touart, Maj, MC, USA
CLINICAL HISTORY: A 7 month old black female presented with a lifelong history of congenital whorled, hyperpigmented, macular eruption on her trunk.At one week of age, scalp and groin vesicles appeared briefly and resolved spontaneously. Verrucous plaques appeared at two months of age on lower legs, hands and feet. Some of the latter lesions resolved spontaneously without
scarring. No systemic involvement, nor developmental
delays noted. Mother and maternal grandmother had similar
pigmented streaks at an early age. One sister unaffected.
Mother had two miscarriages. One maternal brother
unaffected. Mother has subtle reticular hypopigmentation of
upper inner arms.
