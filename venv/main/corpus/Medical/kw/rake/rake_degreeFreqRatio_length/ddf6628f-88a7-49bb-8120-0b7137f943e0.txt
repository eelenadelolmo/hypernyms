Frontoethmoidal mucocele, intracranial extension
• Malignancy of the frontal sinus
• Frontal mucocele
• Fungal sinusitis
60 year old woman with complaints of swelling over left forehead and protrusion of left eye ball of 10 years duration.  Patient is a known diabetic on irregular treatment.
Frontal mucocele is caused due to obstruction (long standing) of frontal sinus ostium.  This obstruction leads to pent up secretions which expands the frontal sinus.  It also led to erosion of the outer and inner tables of frontal sinus.
