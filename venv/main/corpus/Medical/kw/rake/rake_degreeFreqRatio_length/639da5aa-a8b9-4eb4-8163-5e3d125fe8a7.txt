Follow up with orthopedics.
The intial palin films are unremarkable. For the arthrogram portion of the study,  iodinated contrast has been injected into the radiocarpal joint.  Contrast has passed into the distal radial ulnar joint through a small perforation in the triangular fibrocartilage.  Gadolinium was also added to the iodinated contrast to allow MR arthography.  The thin 3-D FSPGR images reveal a small perforation at the radial attachment of the TFC.  Soft tissue thickening at the ulnar attachment of the TFC suggests synovitis.  No definite tear at the ulnar attachment is identified.  The ulna is normally related to the radius on the axial images.  The scapholunate ligament and lunotriquetral ligaments appear intact with no contrast in the midcarpal joint.  The growth plates at the distal radius and ulna have a normal apperance.  No abnormal widening or early fusion of the growth plates is appreciated.
Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Tear
TFC tear
12 year old gymnast with a history of previous fracture of the radius and has had persistent wrist pain.
