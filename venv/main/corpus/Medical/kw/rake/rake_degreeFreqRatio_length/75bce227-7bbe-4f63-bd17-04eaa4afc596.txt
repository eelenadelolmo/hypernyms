GU: Left adnexal fullness and tenderness
WBC: 17.4
AFP: 1.9 (0-10.8)
CA 125: 223 (<35)
HCG: negative
The patient was initially treated with intravenous antibiotics but her pain became progressively worse.  Clinically, she wasn't responding to antibiotic therapy and her CA 125 was elevated. Subsequently, a left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed with the pathologic diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess and no evidence of malignancy.
US (initial & follow-up): 3.4 x 5.7 x 4.8 cm complex L adnexal mass with cystic components

30 year-old female with fever and pelvic pain.
The differential diagnosis for a complex adnexal mass is long but can be narrowed with clinical information and sonographic characteristics. The leading differential diagnoses in this patient were tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) and malignancy.  The patient was treated operatively because of her failure to respond to conservative therapy and the CA-125 elevation.  CA-125 has been shown to be elevated in many patients with serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma but it can be elevated in other conditions such as pelvic infection.  Typically in these cases, the CA-125 is less than 200 miu/ml.

The sonographic appearance of a TOA can be variable but usually is a complex adenxal mass or a cystic mass with internal echos.

TOAs are a known sequela of PID but gonococcus or chlamydia are not typical organisms cultured from TOAs.  TOAs are polymicrobial with a mixture of aerobic, anaerobic and facultative organisms.  Cultures from the endocervix are often not accurate representations of the organisms found in TOAs.  

Treatment of an unruptured TOA is conservative with broad spectrum antibiotics with a good response in 60-70 % of patients.  Failure to repsond is defined as increase in abscess size, persistent fever, persistent leukocytosis or suspected rupture in the first 72 hours and these patients are treated operatively.
