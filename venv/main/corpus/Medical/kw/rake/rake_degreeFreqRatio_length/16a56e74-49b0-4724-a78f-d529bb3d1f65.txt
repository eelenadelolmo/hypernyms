This 27 year old woman was admitted to the hospital after two episodes of chest pain and questionable syncope en route to the hospital. Past medical history includes panic attacks, anxiety, and tetralogy of Fallot. Past surgical history includes Blalock-Taussig shunt placement prior to complete TOF repair at 4 1/2 years of age, pulmonary valve replacement, and right ventricular aneurysm outflow tract patch.
