Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP).  

In Paget disease there is a marked increase in alk phos, which reflects increase in bone formation (w/ symptoms alk phos is 2x normal).
Treatment for Paget disease consists of medications that alter the rate of bone turnover. The two most common treatment medications are bisphosphonates and calcitonin. These are the same treatment medications used in individuals with osteoporosis.  This patient will continue to have follow exams to monitor for metastatic prostate cancer.
Abnormal right pelvis: The right hemipelvis demonstrates mild expansion with cortical and trabecular thickening, especially along the iliopectineal line.

Paget Disease of Bone
58 y.o. man with a history of prostate cancer and new left hip pain.
The classic findings in Paget disease are particularly helpful here in differentiating it from malignancy.  Although a very small percentage of Paget can degenerate into malignancy, the initial presentation should not be confused with malignancy.
