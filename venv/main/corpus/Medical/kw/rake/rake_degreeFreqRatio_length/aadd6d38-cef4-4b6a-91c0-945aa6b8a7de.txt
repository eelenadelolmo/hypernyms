Right lateral gaze limited, otherwise normal exam
Limited treatment options, XRT
Large pontine mass lesion, mildly heterogeneous iso/hypointense to gray matter on T1, hyperintense on T2, and minimally enhancing.
Brain stem astrocytoma
Pontine Astrocytoma - "brainstem glioma"
>WHO Grade 2,3, or 4
Ependymoma
6 yo AA boy presented to the pediatrician with a history of headaches and diplopia.  Referred to the neurologist, initial diagnosis was "likely migraines" but MRI was ordered to rule out underlying pathology.
Abducens (6th) nerve palsy causing lateral rectus paralysis and the defect in lateral gaze is classic.  This nerve arises anteriorly, with a long tract, and is the one most often compromised by these tumors.
