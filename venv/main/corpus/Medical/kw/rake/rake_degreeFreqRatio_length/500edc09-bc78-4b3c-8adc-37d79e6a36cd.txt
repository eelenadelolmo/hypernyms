General: Obese female in NAD
(1) Chronic medical therapy with lifestyle modifications (dietary changes, weight loss) and H2-blockers/PPIs
(2) Surgical therapy with Nissen fundoplication (+/-) gastropexy
UGI with oral contrast demonstrating a normal esophagus and moderate hiatal/paraesophageal hernia.
Hiatal Hernia
Patient complains of chronic reflux symptoms that are especially worse when sleeping at night. Denies any associated dysphagia. She has tried PPIs in the past, but symptoms persist.
More than half of all patients with hiatal hernias are thought to have associated GERD. Therefore, these patients should have routine follow-up and repeat imaging/endoscopy to evaluate for any evidence of progressive esophagitis and/or dysplasia (Barrett's). Ensuring adequate follow-up is key to early detection of malignant transformation.
