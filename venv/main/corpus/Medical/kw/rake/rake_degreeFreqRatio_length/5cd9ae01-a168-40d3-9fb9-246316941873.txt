Physical Exam - unremarkable
Labs:  CMP, amylase, Lipase pending
No specific treatment at this time.  Follow-up with liver function tests to determine if stable or continuing to rise.
Selected Images – CT (contrast, arterial phase) of abdomen/pelvis
1.  Large, diffusely infiltrated fatty liver with accessory left lobe.  Compare to density of spleen.  Multiple areas of focal sparing in left lobe that appears nodular.  
2.  Area of focal sparing near portal vein.
3.  Area focal sparing in left lobe.  Renal cyst and renal calculi.
Hepatic fatty infiltration with focal sparing
Hepatomegaly

•	Carbohydrate – diabetes, glycogen storage disease
•	Iron – hemochromatosis
•	Amyloid - amyloidosis

3.	Cysts
4.	Inflammation/infection
5.	Vascular congestion

Nodular appearance
1.	focal fat infiltration/sparing
2.	hepatocellular carcinoma
3.	metastases
This is 51 year old woman  with known history of nephrolithiasis and left renal cyst.  She was being followed for stones and had long history of abdominal/pelvic CT’s and KUB films.
Previous non-contrast abdominal CT dating back approx 6 months showed evidence for diffuse fatty infiltration and hepatomegaly.  Additionally, a non-contrast CT performed 1 month ago showed increased thickness of the pancreatic head.  A pre- and post-contrast CT were obtained to evaluate for change.

This is a presumptive diagnosis of diffuse fatty liver disease.  The causes for which are many, for instance, alcoholism, obesity, malnutrition, steroid therapy, and diabetes mellitus. Laboratory testing of liver function tests could aid in further diagnosis.  CT imaging is consistent with this diagnosis as the liver appears less dense than the spleen.  Given that the liver findings were discovered incidentally and the patient has been asymptomatic there is no need to aggressively pursue this with further imaging or biopsy.  However, from a medical record review, the patient reported that her primary care manager requested that she be taken off acetaminophen because of high liver function tests.  The results of this test were unavailable. So significant delay in diagnosis could lead to long-term liver damage.  Furthermore, most cases of fatty liver disease will resolve if the etiology is discovered and the offending agent is removed.

The appearance of focal fatty sparing is concerning and could misinterpreted as liver tumor, primary of metastasis.  In this case, the focal sparing is in a triangular shape near the portal vein which is consistent with fat sparing and not a mass.  

Accessory lobes of liver are normal variant and if asymptomatic require no intervention.
