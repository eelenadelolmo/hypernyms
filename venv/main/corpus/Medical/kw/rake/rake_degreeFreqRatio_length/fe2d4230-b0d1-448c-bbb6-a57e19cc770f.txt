1. 7.1x6.8x6.8 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass with calcification, cystic change and hemorrhage located within the right cerebral hemisphere with associated mass effect, midline shift and right uncal herniation.
2. 7.5x5.3 cm heterogeneous mass within the left posterior neck with areas of fat signal intensity. Overall similar in appearance and enhancement to the intraaxial mass.
Glioblastoma multiforme with oligodendroglial component
1. Metastatic disease
2. Liposarcoma of the neck with brain metastasis
3. Primary brain tumor with primary neck tumor
59 year-old man presenting to outside facility with altered mental status.  Head CT at the outside facility showed a brain mass, and the patient was transferred for further workup and management.
The left neck mass originally thought to be the primary tumor site turned out to be an incidental finding after biopsy of the brain lesion proved it to be GBM.  Further workup for the neck mass has not yet been initiated.
