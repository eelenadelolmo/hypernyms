A lateral view of the pharynx during phonation (Films .1 and .3) shows multiple, irregular, 2-4 mm nodules in the oropharynx and in the tonsillar fossa.  A single view of the mid esophagus (Film .2) shows multiple small, well-circumscribed plaques aligned longitudinally along mucosal folds.  Barium has coated the laryngeal vestibule and trachea.
Candida pharyngitis and Candida esophagitis in an immunosuppressed patient.
65-year-old woman with metastatic breast carcinoma and dysphagia.  Look at Films .1 and .2.  What is the diagnosis?
Barium studies of the pharynx are usually of limited value in patients with acute sore throat due to viral, bacterial, or fungal infection.  Such patients usually have normal pharyngograms or nonspecific lymphoid hyperplasia of the palatine or lingual tonsils. A double contrast examination of the pharynx, however, may demonstrate the plaques of Candida pharyngitis or the ulcers of herpes pharyngitis, particularly in immunosuppressed patients and/or patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).  Barium studies may also be helpful to determine whether there is underlying gastroesophageal reflux or reflux esophagitis in patients who have chronic sore throat.

Inflammatory disorders of the pharynx can alter pharyngeal elevation, epiglottic tilt or vocal cord and laryngeal vestibule closure.  Thus, pharyngeal dysmotility due to a local inflammatory process may result in laryngeal penetration, as in this case. Pharyngeal dysmotility is common following radiation therapy or in patients with marked gastroesophageal reflux.
