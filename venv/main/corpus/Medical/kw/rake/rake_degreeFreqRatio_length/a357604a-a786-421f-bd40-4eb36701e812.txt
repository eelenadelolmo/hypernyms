Abdominal mass noted on well-child exam.
MONITOR – Early Detection Vital!

Baseline CT at diagnosis
US/MR alternating every 3-4 months until age 7
(Based on National Wilms’ Tumor Studies – 6 month time frame for met development)

R/O associated syndromes (Beckwidth-Wiedemann, WAGR etc.)

Most will spontaneously resolve but enlargement suggests degeneration to Wilms tumor
US: Diffusely enlarged, lobulated contour and hypoechoic cortical masses

CT: Diffuse enlargement, multiple round masses of low attenuation, symmetry, compressed central enhancing kidney parenchyma
Nephroblastomatosis
Wilms Tumor
Nephroblastomatosis
16 month-old asymptomatic female reaching normal developmental milestones without significant PMH.
-Multiple Foci of “Nephrogenic Rests” (embryonic tissue persistence)
-Risk for Malignant transformation (Wilms tumor)
-Genetic Link  
-Types:
1. Intralobar – random, less common than perilobar, higher risk or malignant transformation, associated with WAGR, Drash syndrome, sporadic aniridia (30% progress to Wilms) 
2. Perilobar – multiple at cortio-medullary jxn or cortex, associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann (5% progress to Wilms), hemihypertrophy,  Perlman syndrome, trisomy 18
