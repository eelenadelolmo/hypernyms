Texto: 
The patient has point tenderness and swelling localized to the first metacarpal carpal joint of his left hand.
Treatment varies depending on the degree of dislocation.  In this case due to minimal displacement of the distal fragment, casting can be considered.  However a significant number of patients with this injury will develop some degree of post traumatic artritis.  Pinning of the facture is usually performed to help prevent this from occurring. If there is greater than 3 mm of displacement ORIF is performed.
There is an intra-articular fracture of the base of the first metacarpal with minimal radial displacement of the larger distal and radial fragment.  The epiphyses of the distal ulna and radius are open a finding that correlates to a bone age of 17.
Bennett's fracture dislocation
Bennett's fracture dislocation
Rolando's fracture
A male patent, who claims to be twenty, reports that he "fell on [his] thumb."
The usually mechanism associated with this injury is axial loading with slight flexion of the carpal metacarpal joint  (i.e. a punch delivered by an inexperienced brawler).  This patient is probably lying about the mechanism of injury and about his age.  Pugalists are taught to fixate their wrists in a neutral position before delivering a blow to prevent this sort of injury.
