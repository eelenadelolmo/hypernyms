Labs: TSH-0.007 uIU/ml, free T4-3.60 ng/dl
-Radioactive Iodine Ablation
-The patient will need ongoing Endocrinologic follow-up based, in large part, on the very high liklihood of hypothyroidism and the need for Synthroid.

The liklihood of this being anything except Graves' disease is extremely low (even without a +TSI.  If the accumulation of radiotracer was at least somewhat heterogeneous, Hashitoxicosis would be a consideration
