HEENT: mildly diffusely enlarged, non tender thyroid gland
Labs: TSH-0.007 uIU/ml, free T4-3.60 ng/dl
-Radioactive Iodine Ablation
-The patient will need ongoing Endocrinologic follow-up based, in large part, on the very high liklihood of hypothyroidism and the need for Synthroid.
Diffusely enlarged, regularly contoured thyroid gland within thyroid bed with homogeneous trapping throughout. No focal areas of either decreased or increased radiotracer accumulation.
24Hr RAIU-77.3% (nl=8-30%)
Graves' Disease
The scintigraphic findings combined with the RAIU and TFT's (and history) result in a very narrow DDx.  The liklihood of this being anything except Graves' disease is extremely low (even without a +TSI.  If the accumulation of radiotracer was at least somewhat heterogeneous, Hashitoxicosis would be a consideration
