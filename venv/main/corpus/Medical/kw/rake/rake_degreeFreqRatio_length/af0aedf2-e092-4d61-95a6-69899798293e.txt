Unremarkable physical exam.
Patient was returned to referring Oncologist who had 2 treatment plans ready depending on the results of cytopathology - the first for breast CA and the second for colorectal CA.

Final Path: 'Identical to colorectal CA primary’
+ CDX-2 (88% of colon CA +)
- Cytokeratin 7
- TTF-1
- Estrogen receptor
• CT chest demonstrates 1.5 cm left lung nodule.
• S/p bilateral subcutaneous mastectomy with saline implant reconstruction

• PET/CT correlates high level of activity (6.5 SUV-m) to the same lesion.

• CT biopsy images, with the patient in a right-lateral decubitus position, shows introduction of a 25 gauge catheter into the nodular lesion.  Following the Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA), there is a minimal biopsy-associated hemorrhage - but no pneumothorax.
Colorectal CA Metastasis to lung, Fine Needle Aspiration
• Benign nodule
• Primary lung malignancy
• Metastatic Disease (breast CA)
• Metastatic disease (colorectal CA)
49 year-old woman with a history of breast cancer and colorectal cancer.
FNA was selected for this outpatient in an attempt to minimize her stay in the hospital by reducing complication risks and to speed her diagnosis to allow appropriate treatment of her metastatic disease.  Had the cytopathology technologist at the case declared the sample to be inadequate then a switch to core biopsy would have occurred.
