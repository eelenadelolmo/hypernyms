Texto: 
Well-developed male in no apparent distress.  Alert and oriented x3. Left facial droop.

Slight swelling of the right wrist.  
Limited dorsiflexion and palmar flexion (60 and 45 degrees respectively) when compared to the left wrist (80 and 55 respectively).  
Full pronation and supination bilaterally.
Grip strength: Right--32kg, Left--50kg; associated painful popping on the right.
Watson shift test: positive on the right.
Finger motion: full bilaterally.
No sensory abnormalities bilaterally.
Surgery to prevent further arthritic changes of the wrist.  Options are a scaphoidectomy with 4 corner fusion or a proximal row carpectomy.
MRI showed DISI deformity and arthritic changes at the radioscaphoid joint, but sparing of the lunate fossa.
Scapholunate dissociation with DISI
1. Scapholunate dissociation with DISI
2. Osteoarthitis
3. Kienbock's disease
4. Scaphoid fracture
49 year old right-handed male who was in involved in a motor vehicle accident in 2010 with injury to his right wrist.  After the accident, he has had increasing pain and stiffness in his right wrist, with an associated popping sensation upon use.  He also noticed decreased strength of the right wrist.

No history of arthritis or wrist problems before the accident.

PMH: HTN, acoustic schwannoma.
PSH: Surgical resection of acoustic schwannoma  in January 2011.
SH: unable to work-on disability; lives alone. No smoking or alcohol use.

Because this patient has had a torn scapholunate ligament with scapholunate dissociation for two years, arthritic changes have already taken place.  Therefore, repair of the ligament to restore the joint is not possible.  The course of action depends upon the extent of arthritis in the joints.
