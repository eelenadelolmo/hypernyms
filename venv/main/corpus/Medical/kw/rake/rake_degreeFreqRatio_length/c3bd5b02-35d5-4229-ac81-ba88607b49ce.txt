• Papilledema
• No focal deficit
Pre-operative ventricular drain placement followed by resection of mass.
• Non-enhancing Third ventricular Mass extending through the foramen of Monro into the right lateral ventricle.
• Mass is CSF signal intensity on all sequences except on Flair imaging.
• Secondary obstructive hydrocephalus.
Papillary Glioneuronal Tumor
• Colloid Cyst
• Choroid Plexus Cyst
• Neurocysticercosis
46 year old woman "found down" at home and brought to ER. Past history of headaches for many years.
Glioneuronal tumors, while rare, are almost never found in an intra-ventricular location
