Texto: 
Non-obese, normotensive male. 

Cranial nerves intact. Sensation intact in upper and lower extremities to light touch with monofilament exam, pin prick, and vibration. Position sense intact in great toes and thumbs bilaterally. 

Normal reflexes in upper and lower extremities. 

Quantitative strength testing revealed some weakness. 
Upper extremity:  weakness in right biceps muscle compared to left 
Lower extremity: weakness in left extensors, right flexors and flexor hallucis brevis. 

Limited range of motion in cervical and lumbar spine.
Patient continues chiropractic care. 

Patient consulted a neurosurgeon regarding the radiological report of syringohydromyelia. The neurosurgeon does not feel the patient is a surgical candidate.
Patient received MRI wo contrast for cervical and lumbar spine 1 month post-MVA as well MRI w/wo contrast for thoracic spine and brain 3 months post-MVA.

Syringohydromyelia 2mm in maximum diameter, located centrally with no surrounding edema from cervicomedullary junction to T4. No evidence for a Chiari malformation. No abnormal spinal enhancement.

Cervical spine:
C3-C4: Small bilateral disc protrusions with mild narrowing of the bilateral neural foramina.
C4-C5 Tiny bilateral disc protrustions with slight narrowing of right neural foramen. 

Lumbar spine:
Early mild facet arthropathy throughout lumbar spine. 
L3-L4: Small left foraminal disc protrusion without significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.
L4-L5: Slight asymmetric disc bulge to left.
L5-S1 Tiny central disc protrusion.
Persistent Central Canal/Post-traumatic Syringomyelia
-Persistent central canal
-Syringomyelia, syringohydromyelia, syrinx, spinal cyst
-Neoplasm
Patient is a 20 year old male involved in a MVA three months ago, who has been receiving chiropractic care following his accident. Patient c/o back, neck and shoulder pain as well as headaches approximately three times per week. 
Pertinent negatives: he denies shortness of breath, changes in vision, dizziness, fainting or psychiatric history. He denies any loss of bladder or bowel control, numbness in extremities or painless injuries. 
The remainder or the review of symptoms was negative.

This patient's cervical and thoracic spine MRIs were read as syringohydromyelia, however, it is more likely the patient has a persistent central canal, given the imaging characteristics, the lack of symptoms of syringomyelia, and the lack of Chiari malformation or severe spinal cord injury. The incidental finding of a persistent central canal requires no follow-up, in contrast to a diagnosis of post-traumatic syringomyelia or syringohydromyelia which requires follow-up, potential surgical intervention,  and carries the grim prognosis of neurological deterioration.
