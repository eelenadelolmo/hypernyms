Radiology: Glioblastoma is usually seen as a grossly heterogeneous mass. Ring enhancement surrounding a necrotic 
center is the most common presentation, but there may be multiple rings. Surrounding vasogenic edema can be 
impressive, and adds significantly to the mass effect. Signs of recent (methemoglobin) and remote (hemosiderin) 
hemorrhage are common. Despite it’s apparent demarcation on enhanced scans, the lesion may diffusely infiltrate into 
the brain, crossing the corpus callosum in 50-75% of cases
