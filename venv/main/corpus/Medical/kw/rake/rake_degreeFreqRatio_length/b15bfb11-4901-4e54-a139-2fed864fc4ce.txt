As screening CT Colonography (CTC) continues to increase in use, review of common polypoid colonic lesions (such as lipoma and adenoma) becomes important.  Colonic lipomas are common benign tumors with a characteristic fatty appearance.  Smaller lipomas are being found more frequently due to increased efforts to use CTC and optical colonoscopy.
