Gen: Appeared his stated age. He was in obvious pain with ambulation. 
Ext: Non-pitting edema and ecchymosis localized to the lateral aspect of the right knee and lower leg. The area was not especially warm to touch, but was tender to palpation.
Small hematomas can be managed expectantly. Larger ones, as seen in this case, are managed with I&D.
• Frontal and lateral radiographs of the right femur, tibia, and fibula did not reveal any fractures or aggressive osseous lesions. There were mild degenerative changes of the knee with medial and lateral tibial spine spurring, marginal osteophyte formation, and superior patellar osteophyte formation. Subchondral irregularities were appreciated at the medial tibial plateau.

• CT with IV contrast revealed a 17 x 8 x 5 cm layering fluid collection in the subcutaneous, extra-fascial compartment of the lateral right lower leg and knee. Hounsfield units of the fluid collection was approximately 45. Previously identified thrombus in right venous collecting system was not visualized due to timing of IV contrast.
Hematoma, Compartment Syndrome
•Hematoma
•Deep vein thrombosis
•Post-thrombotic syndrome
•Fracture
65 year old man on warfarin therapy after suffering bilateral DVT's one week ago, presents now with three days of increasing right leg pain after tripping and hitting a table.
Anticoagulated patients are susceptible to hematoma formation. The fact that this patient recently experienced a DVT and was put on warfarin makes an interesting differential. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K dependent clotting factors, but also inhibits protein C and S which can initially create a thrombogenic state. However, the peak effect of warfarin is reached after 2-3 days, so the timeline does not match this patient's case. In addition he was on heparin therapy initially, which should have helped prevent another DVT or expansion of his previous DVT.

Post-thrombotic syndrome can present with edema, skin changes, and pain. These symptoms tend to be chronic, and this patient has  a mechanism for trauma. The CT findings were not consistent with this diagnosis. No fracture was observed on x-ray or CT.
