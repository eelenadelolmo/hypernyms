Texto: 
Evidence of hepatomegaly on physical examination but no palpable focal abdominal mass.  Labs notable for nonspecifically and mildly elevated LFTs.
Enlarged liver with nodular and heterogeneous pattern of enhancement.  Periportal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  These findings are consistent with abdominal sarcoid in this clinical setting.
Sarcoidosis, Abdomen and Liver
Metastatic Disease (colon, stonach, pancreas, breast, lung)
Lymphoma
Other Infiltrative Liver Processes
Patient with history of thoracic sarcoid presenting with increasing LFTs and pruritis.
