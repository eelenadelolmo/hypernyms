Palpable left chest wall mass.
Treatment usually consists of chemotherapy with or without surgical excision after tumor size decreases.  Follow-up of primary site and metastatic site performed every 3-4 months during treatment and for first year after treatment.  Follow-up then gradually becomes less frequent.
Chest radiographs show large dense opacity in the left chest abutting and silhouetting the left hemidiaphragm with destruction of the left 8th rib.

Contrast enhanced CT demonstrates a large heterogeneously enhanging chest wall mass. An intrathoracic and extrathoracic component is present. Expansion and destruction of an anterolateral left rib is noted.

MRI of the chest with gadolinium show the mass enhancing.  There are central cystic areas of hemorrhage and necrosis.  Surrounding chest wall edema is noted.
Ewing Sarcoma
Ewings sarcoma
Askin tumor (PNET of the chest wall)
Osteosarcoma
10 y/o boy presents with 2 weeks of cough, fever and malaise.
Patient also underwent bone scan with no evidence of metastatic disease.
