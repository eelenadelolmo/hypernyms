Occlusion of the right vertebral artery at the C1-2 level with subacute infarction of the right lateral medulla oblongata, and chronic infarction of the left flocculonodular lobe, as a result of traumatic chiropractic cervical manipulation.
Right Vertebral Artery Dissection, Lateral Medullary Syndrome (Wallenberg Syndrome)
Dissection
Racemose Capillary Telangiectasia
28 y.o. woman, four months postpartum, with onset of neck pain, severe vertigo associated with severe vomiting, anesthesia of the right hemi-facial region and loss of sensation in the region of the left upper and lower extremities immediately following cervical chiropractic manipulation.  The patient was unsuccessfully treated for vertigo associated with Meniereâ€™s disease. The patient underwent a second cervical chiropractic treatment 15 days later, and presented with recurrent severe vertigo and associated hemi-anesthesia and difficulty phonating.  Imaging was obtained one month following the initial chiropractic treatment
Lateral Medullary Syndrome (Wallenberg Syndrome) is produced by infarction of a section of the lateral medulla supplied by a vertebral or posterior inferior cerebellar artery.  The damaged structures may include the vestibular nuclei (nystagmus, oscillopsia, vertigo, nausea, vomiting); spinothalamic tract (contralateral impairment of pain and thermal sense over half the body); descending sympathetic fibers (ipsilateral Horner syndrome â€“ miosis, ptosis, decreased sweating); fibers of the ninth and tenth cranial nerves (hoarseness, dysphagia, ipsilateral paralysis of the palate and vocal cord, diminished gag reflex); otolithic nucleus (vertical diplopia and illusion of tilting of vision); spinal trigeminal tract (pain, burning, and impaired sensation over ipsilateral half of face); nucleus and tractus solitarus (loss of taste); olivocerebellar or spinocerebellar fibers, restiform body and inferior cerebullum (ipsilateral ataxia of limbs, falling or toppling to the ipsilateral side).  This syndrome is almost always secondary to infarction, with only a small portion being the result of hemorrhage or tumor.  Most patients recover well, although reports of sudden and unexpected death may occur from respiratory or cardiac arrest in the absence of cerebellar swelling or basilar artery thrombosis.

It is interesting to note, there was no restricted diffusion indicating this was not an acute event.  Burdette et al. report that infarctions greater than two weeks old, will demonstrate no signal abnormalities on diffusion-weighted imaging. Additionally, contrast enhancement in subacute strokes with iodinated contrast agents is well understood, and is secondary to extravasation of contrast material through a leaky blood-brain barrier.  Likewise, similar findings were documented in this case with enhancement of the lateral medulla following the administration of gadolinium DTPA, consistent with a subacute infarct.
