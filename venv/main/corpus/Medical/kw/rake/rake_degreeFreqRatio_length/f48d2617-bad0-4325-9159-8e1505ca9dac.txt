>> Presentation:
- Decreased active ROM of cervical spine; flexion, extension, and left rotation produced neck pain radiating to the upper- and mid-back areas; right and left lateral bending produced left shoulder pain
- Cervical compression testing produced report of cervical pain radiating to both shoulders and into the thoracic spinal region 
- Markedly diminished grip strength on the left (5lbs.) compared to the right (30 lbs.), right-hand dominant; weak (4/5) left finger/wrist extensors  
- Limited elevation of left shoulder
- (+) Neer’s and (+) Hawkins-Kennedy impingement tests on left shoulder, with pain elicited
- (+) supraspinatus test on left shoulder, with pain elicited
- Decreased active ROM of thoracolumbar spine; flexion, extension, and left/right lateral bending produced lower back pain
- Normal biceps and triceps reflexes bilaterally
- Low right shoulder and low right hip on postural evaluation
- Muscle spasm along the posterior neck and into the upper trapezius muscles
- Percussion and posterior-to-anterior spinal compression produced pain over the cervicothoracic and lumbosacral regions; hypomobility also noted in these areas.
The patient has received 3 months of diathermy for her left shoulder, electrical stimulation to the cervicodorsal/lumbosacral regions and Chiropractic manipulative therapy with only minor pain relief to the shoulder region.  Due to the presence of motor weakness and positive cervical compression testing procedures she also received MRI evaluation of the cervical spine which revealed a C3/C4 disc herniation.  Such condition can produce overlapping symptomatology and needs to be differentiated by EMG testing of the cervical and upper extremities to exclude radiculopathy.   She does not wish to receive subacromial corticosteroid injections. She is scheduled for orthopedic surgery for rotator cuff repair.
>>MRI of Left Shoulder (August 2011)
Full-thickness tear noted at the anterior attachment of the supraspinatus tendon that measures approximately 6mm in AP diameter and 8mm in longitudinal diameter. Mild sprain/intrasubstance tears at the musculotendinous junctions of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons are also seen. The remainder of the rotator cuff was unremarkable. No fractures/dislocations or acute bony abnormalities; the acromioclavicular and glenohumeral articulations are unremarkable. No labral tears or dislocation of the long head of biceps; the bicipital labral complex is unremarkable.

41-year-old African American female presents to the Doctor of Chiropractic with neck pain, headache, and pain in the left side of her body following a motor vehicle accident. She reports pain in her left upper extremity from shoulders to fingers, and left lower extremity from buttocks to calf. Her pain is persistent and sometimes severe enough to awake her from sleep. She does not have numbness/tingling on her left side; she maintains bowel and bladder control.

The patient presented after a motor vehicle accident with left-sided pain consistent with being struck on that side by an oncoming vehicle. Although she reports no numbness/tingling, her pain has been persistent and poorly-relieved with conservative therapy. Orthopedic tests performed in the office revealed signs of impingement and rotator cuff pathology; subsequent MRI of the shoulder confirmed a full-thickness rotator cuff tear. Early surgical repair is paramount in cases of full-thickness supraspinatus tears because it has significant impact on surgical outcomes such as shoulder ROM and long-term pain relief.
