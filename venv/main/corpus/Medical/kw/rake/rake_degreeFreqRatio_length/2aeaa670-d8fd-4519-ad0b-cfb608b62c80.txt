Texto: 
Cardiac, chest, oropharynx, and neck exam within normal limits
No treatment or follow-up necessary
P/A- extra edge noted on right side of cardiac shadow

Lateral- signs of extrinsic posterior compression of airway superior to aortic arch
Extra or Enlarged Pericardial Fat Pad   
There is a left arch with soft tissue compression of the esophagus on lateral view consistent with a normal variant: left aortic arch with aberrant right subclavian.

Aberrant vessels can lie posterior to esophagus.  In right arch, this may be an aberrant left subclavian.  With a left arch, this could be an aberrant right subclavian.  Other variations like double arch are generally more symptomatic, earlier in life.
