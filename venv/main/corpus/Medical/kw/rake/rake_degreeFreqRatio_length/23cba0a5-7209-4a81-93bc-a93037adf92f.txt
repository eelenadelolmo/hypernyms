Texto: 
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, rubs or gallops.

Pulmonary: Transmitted breath sounds from ventilator. Coarse bilaterally with decreased sounds in Left Upper Lobe.
Pt seen by interventional cardiology and underwent single-catheter intervention with balloon dilatation of stenotic pulmonary veins.

Pt followed regularly by cardiology for signs of re-stenosis after balloon dilatation.
Cardiac CT with Contrast:
1. Marked band-like narrowing is present in the right upper lobe pulmonary vein and the left lower lobe pulmonary vein. The left upper lobe pulmonary vein is difficult to visualize.
2. Marked pulmonary artery hypertension with massive enlargement of the main pulmonary artery.
3. Confirmation of the clinical suspicion of a left SVC. The central venous catheter is in the left SVC.
4. There is a moderate-sized ASD.
5. Extensive chronic lung disease with consolidation in in the dependent portions and in the upper lobes bilaterally.

CXR:
There is increasing right basilar consolidation. Marked
cardiomegaly is noted.
Congenital Pulmonary Vein Stenosis
1. Mitral Stenosis
2. Cor Triatriatum
3.  Pulmonary vein stenosis
Pt is a 9 month old female born at 26wks gestation with multiple medical conditions including chronic lung disease of prematurity with ventilator dependency, seizure disorder and ASD who has history of recurrent respiratory infections.
