Percutaneous pinning
Radiograph: Focal cortical discontinuity at the lateral aspect of the subcapital femoral neck, with a thin linear density extending from this discontinuity toward the medial aspect of the femoral neck. The trabeculae in the femoral head are vertically oriented. Atherosclerotic calcification of the left femoral artery also appreciated.

CT:  Axial CT images through the left hip reveal cortical disruption in the anterior and posterior subcapital femoral neck.  There is a triangular spicule of disrupted cortex anteriorly, with a step-off of the femoral neck cortex posteriorly.
