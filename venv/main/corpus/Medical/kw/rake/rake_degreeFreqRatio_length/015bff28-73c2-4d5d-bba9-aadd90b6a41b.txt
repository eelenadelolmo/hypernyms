The diagnosis of Chiari I Malformation was confirmed with multiple follow-up MRI’s.  The patient was taken to surgery for bony decompression with lysis of dural bands.  A subperiosteal resection was performed down to the occiput, to the level of C1-C2 and to the foramen magnum.  Decompression was then performed until there was a free epidural space.  Exuberant dural bands were noted across the craniovertebral junction and extending underneath C1.  Intraoperative ultrasound was then used, which revealed the tonsils were covered with dural bands and there was decreased CSF flow (5 cm/sec).  The dural bands were then divided in midline and retracted.  Ultrasound then revealed increased CSF flow to 7 cm/sec with patent retrocerebellar space and bidirectional flow velocity.  The patient was seen in follow-up 1.5 weeks later and was reported to have no more drooling, swallowing well, and sleeping through the night with no coughing.
Evidence of cerebellar ectopia with the cerebellar tonsils extending approximately 9 mm below the foramen magnum.  Cine images show restricted flow posteriorly.
