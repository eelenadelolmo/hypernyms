Projection of the superior left anterior acetabular rim lateral to the posterior lip, also known as the cross-over sign.
Cranial Acetabular Retroversion
The other pincer-type deformity is known as coxa profunda, though there is not necessarily a differential for this case.
48 year old female with a several year history of hip pain, mostly in the left. NSAIDS have offered little relief.
