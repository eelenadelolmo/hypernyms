RESULTS:
	Prior to mass work-up, the following lab data was collected:

WBC 5.9                            GLU  91
RBC 4.44                            BUN 10
HGB 13.7		        Creat 1.0
HCT 39.1		        NA+  140
MCV 88		        K+     3.9

Neut#  3.70; Lymph# 1.10; Mono# 0.50; Eos# 0.70

AFP 1.0  (0.0-6.1)
TREATMENT:
  Therapy is based on the presenting stage of the disease. (Stages discussed in "Discussion).
Stage IA, IIA: radiation therapy or combination radiation and chemotherapy
Stage IIIA: radiation or chemotherapy
Stage IV: combination chemotherapy.

When B symptoms are present, chemotherapy is recommended regardless of stage.
SURVIVAL RATES BY STAGE:
Stage	5-year relative survival rate
I	90% to 95%
II	90% to 95%
III	85% to 90%
IV	about 80%
Chest X-ray revealed R sided medistinal mass without evidence of any other acute cardiopulmonary process .

   Subsequently, a biopsy of the mediastinal mass was performed. Initial frozen section revealed FIBROUS TUSSUE WITH LYMPHOID POPULATION.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 
HODGKIN’S LYMPHOMA, NODULAR SCLEROSING CELL TYPE
“Sections show thick fibrotic bands with small benign-appearing lymphocytes and occasional eosinophils. Additionally, there are widely scattered large atypical cells with prominent nucleoli. These cells are positive for CD15 and CD30; negative for LCA, CD20, and CD3.”

INTRO: 21 yo white female presented to her physician with an unknown chief complaint.  A chest x-ray was done revealing an anterior R sided mediastinal mass.
DISCUSSION:
	Hodgkin’s lymphoma is a malignancy of the lymphatic system that usually presents with cervical adenopathy. Its incidence is estimated by the American Cancer Society as 7,880 cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma (4,330 men and 3,550 women) diagnosed in the U.S. in 2004, less than 1% of all cancer diagnoses.   Approximately 131,279 members of the U.S. population are living with Hodgkin's lymphoma.  85-90% of Hodgkin's occurs in adults, 10 to 15% in children.  It is more common, though, in 2 age groups: early adulthood (age 15-40, usually 25-30) and late adulthood (after age 55). Hodgkin's is rare before 5 years of age.

	Lymphoma of any type is usually diagnosed by biopsy of an enlarged lymph node with identification of specific Reed-Sternberg cells on examination.

TYPES OF HODGKIN’S LYMPHOMA:
•	Nodular sclerosis (NS). The lymph nodes in the lower neck, chest and collarbone usually contain normal and reactive lymphocytes and Reed-Sternberg cells separated by bands of scar-like tissues. NS accounts for 60-70% of Hodgkin's cases. NS appears to account for the increase in Hodgkin's cases in recent years 
•	Lymphocyte predominance (LP). The lymph nodes are composed largely of reactive lymphocytes and malignant L&H cells which have a "popcorn" appearance and very few Reed-Sternberg cells. LP accounts for 5% of Hodgkin's cases and affects more men than women. 
•	Mixed cellularity (MC). The lymph nodes usually contain Reed-Sternberg cells and inflammatory cells. MC accounts for 20-30% of Hodgkin's cases. 
•	Lymphocyte depleted (LD). There are two different variations of this classification: one with sheets of differing malignant cells; the other with few Reed-Sternberg cells and lymphocytes with scar-like tissue. Accounts for about 5% of Hodgkin's cases. 
•	Nodular lymphocyte predominant (NLP) Hodgkin's lymphoma - while the 4 types above are "Classical" types, NLP is in a category of its own. Typical Reed-Sternberg cells are rare to non-existent; instead variants called L & H cells (colloquially "popcorn cells") are seen.  

STAGING is organized into 4 categories:

Stage I:     disease localized to single lymph node or group
Stage II:   disease involving more than one lymph node or group, but confined to one side 
	     of the diaphragm
Stage III:  disease in the lymph nodes or the spleen and occurs of both sides of the 
	     diaphragm
Stage IV:  disease involving the liver, lung, skin, or bone marrow
