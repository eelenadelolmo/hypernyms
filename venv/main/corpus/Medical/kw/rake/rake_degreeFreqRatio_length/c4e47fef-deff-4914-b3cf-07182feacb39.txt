Incomplete abortion
Cervical Ectopic Pregnancy
Patient sent from Emergency Dept with pelvic pain and bleeding.  Beta- hCG is positive.
While the cervix represents an uncommon site for ectopic pregnancy, failure of recognition can result in life threatening hemorrhage.  Most often, ectopic pregnancies in this location are mistaken for a pending spontaneous abortion with the gestational sac not yet passed but approaching passage.
