No additional findings.
Symmetrical dilatation of the lateral and 3rd ventricles with normal size of the 4th ventricle.  No intraventricular masses.
Aqueductal stenosis.
Hydrocephalus
Aqueductal stenosis
Communicating and non communicating hydrocephalus.
4 month old female history of enlarging head circumference.
Most frequent cause of congenital hydrocephalus (20-43%).  Occurs in .5-1 in 1,000 
births.  Recurrence rate in siblings is 1-4.5%.  Multiple causes but most common from post 
inflammation  secondary to peri natal infection(50%), developmental and less likely neoplastic.  
Developmental causes include forking of the aqueduct, which is a X linked recessive inheritance.  Neoplasms are extremely rare and can be from pinealoma, meningioma or tectal astrocytoma.  Associated anomalies occur in 16% of the cases.  Those with associated anomalies have poor outcome.  If aqueductal stenosis is isolated , nonprogressive abnormality, then a functionally and mentally normal outcome can be seen in 50-80% even if cortical thinning is seen.  Mortality 11-30%
