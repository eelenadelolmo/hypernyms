Examination: Large necrotic ulcer on the right shin

Laboratory: Fungal cultures eventually grew Pythium insidiosum (an atypical fungal
like algae)
Course: The patient responded poorly to systemic antifungals, and later underwent a lower extremity amputation. She expired weeks after presenting.
Histopathology: (one of many specimens) - The biopsy shows an ulceration with necrosis extending into the subcutaneous fat. Fungal stains demonstrate non-septate, thin-walled, branching hyphae with manyorganisms in and around vessels.

History: 62 year-old white female with end stage liver disease secondary to alcohol abuse presented with a slowly enlarging ulcer about one week after "bumping" her leg in a swimming pool.
