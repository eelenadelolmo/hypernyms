Follow up included nerve conduction studies and electromyography studies which revealed bilateral upper and lower extremity sensory and motor peripheral polyneuropathy compatible with history of diabetes. Bilaterall L3, L4 and L5 radiculopathies were noted. No electrophysiological evidence of cervical radiculopathy, brachial plexopathy or myopathy was observed. 

This patient has been treated conservatively with chiropractic care 2-3 times per week. He has found this sufficient to control his symptoms but has noticed that when he misses treatments he has worsening of his symptoms.

Cervical Sprain, cervical canal stenosis with foraminal stenosis, degenerative disc disease in cervical and lumbar spine, lumbar spondylosis, lumbar radiculopathy
Given this patient’s history of motor vehicle accident and trauma the patient should be evaluated for lumbar disc herniation, lumbar radiculopathy, cervical disc herniation, cervical strain or sprain, thoracic strain or sprain, and compression fractures. The patient should also be evaluated for degenerative disc disease and osteoarthritis given his age. Finally, with symptoms of back pain and a history prostate enlargement, it is important to rule out neoplasm and metastases to the spine.

This patient should also be evaluated for myelomalacia given his gender, age (1), and traumatic history of compressive injury to his spinal cord. Hemorrhage commonly occurs after trauma leaving those in traumatic accidents at risk for myelomalacia. Another risk factor for myelomalacia is ischemia, which can occur concomitantly with herniated disc or can be a result of atherosclerosis among other causes. It would present as a hyperintense area on T2 weighted MRI images and may have areas of focal spinal atrophy.
Patient is a 63-year-old man who is status post motor vehicle accident. He was the belted driver in a vehicle that was struck from behind at an unknown speed. His airbag did not deploy, however the airbag of the driver who struck him from behind did deploy. Patient reports no loss of consciousness or blood loss. After the accident, he went to the ER with complaints of neck, shoulder, back, and knee pain. X-rays were taken and were presumably negative. He was discharged home with Naprosyn for pain. Currently, the patient presents with ongoing neck pain that radiates into his left mid arm but does not go past the elbow. He reports noticeable “stiffness” in his neck as well. He denies any numbness or tingling and any subjective weakness. Movement of his neck exacerbates his pain. He also reports low back pain in the lumbar region, as indicated by patient. The pain radiates into both buttocks but the right worse than the left. He denies any numbness or tingling into his buttocks or legs and reports no subjective weakness in his lower extremities. Standing and walking exacerbate the lower back pain. The pain in both his upper and lower spine is rated as a 4-5/10.  Finally, he also reports “stiffness” in his thoracic region, worse on the right side than the left.
Patient reports he is a nonsmoker. He works part time as a bus driver and is continuing to work presently.

Past Medical History: 
This patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, benign prostatic hyperplasia and obstructive sleep apnea. His current medications include Lisinopril 40mg PO QD, Glyburide 2.5 mg PO QD, Atorvastatin 40mg PO QD, Tamsulosin HCl 0.4mg PO QD, Aspirin 81 mg PO QD, Vitamin D 2000u PO QD and Aleve as needed for pain. He has had a left total knee replacement and right total knee replacement 12 and 9 years ago respectively.

As previously mentioned this patient has done sufficiently with conservative care. Presently, a majority of his complaints lie within his cervical and thoracic region. He continues to note stiffness in his neck despite physical therapy and chiropractic treatments. He also endorses pain that is localized his neck, but can radiate into his shoulders and arms with lateral rotation. This is consistent with his relatively mild cervical MRI and lack of findings on EMG and nerve conduction studies. On physical exam he has unilateral paraspinal muscle tension throughout his spine and into his right buttocks which may contribute to his continued pain. He also has some progression of findings on physical exam including decreased range of motion and decreased biceps reflex. 

Despite his lack of complaints in his lower lumbar region, this is the area with the most significant findings on the studies performed. Currently, his only complaint regarding his lumbar spine is pain in his lower back that radiates into his right buttock. On MRI, he has significant disc bulge and facet and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy leading to moderate to severe central canal and neural foraminal stenosis at L3-L4, L4-L5, L5-S1. These changes on MRI are consistent with the changes seen on EMG and nerve conduction study showing radiculopathies at the L3, L4, and L5 levels. 

Regarding treatment options moving forward, a neurosurgery consult was requested. In the cervical spine, surgical intervention would be prophylactic. Given the disc changes, myelopathic disease such as myelomalacia could lead to permanent spinal cord damage causing numbness, weakness, and balance disturbances. 

Myelomalacia or “softening of the spinal cord” is a degenerative change of the spinal cord that can be seen on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (1, 2). This condition is a result of spinal cord injury that can be due to various causes including cord compression, ischemia, and hemorrhage (1). After primary damage to the cord, there can be secondary damage due to electrolyte shifts, release of free radicals, cellular enzymes, and vasoactive substances from damaged cells. This chemical injury is not limited to the area of damage because the subdural space around the spinal cord is continuous and thus permits ascension/descension of the damage and progression of the myelomalacia (2). Early stages of myelomalacia are defined by hyperintensity on T2 weighted images (T2WI) and changes in the width of the spinal cord. The intermediate stage is characterized by hyperintensity on T2WI and cystic necrosis of the central grey matter. Late stage myelomalacia is defined as hyperintensity on T2WI and hypointensity on T1 weighted images, central cystic degeneration, syrinx formation, and atrophy (3).

Overall, if myelomalacia is found early, it may be reversible if the inciting injury (e.g. compression, ischemia, or hemorrhage) is corrected (1,3).  However, if MRI indicates that it has progressed to the late stage of the disease, it is unlikely that fixing the problem surgically will allow for reversal of the disease. Regardless, patients with myelomalacia may benefit from surgical intervention to prevent progression through the spinal cord. Radiological changes and staging of disease as described above may be used predict prognosis of surgical outcome. Patients in early stages of disease with only hyperintense changes on T2WI (early/intermediate myelomalacia) had better prognosis following surgery (4).

The neurosurgeon also noted that if another motor vehicle accident were to occur, acute myelopathic deterioration could occur. Given the prophylactic nature of the operation, it would be this patient’s choice to undergo the procedure and at present time he chooses to continue conservative treatment.

Regarding his lumbar spine, the degree of multilevel disc disease is so severe that fusion is not an option. However, if the pain became unbearable the surgeon recommended possible spinal cord stimulation. Given the amount of changes seen on physical exam (such as gait and balance disturbances as well as sensory and motor changes), EMG, and nerve conduction study, risks of disease progression in this area include bladder and bowel dysfunction among other changes. He seems to be stable with his current treatment; however, follow up MRI to monitor the progression of his disease does not seem unreasonable to look for permanent myelopathic changes of the spinal cord in both the cervical and lumbar regions.
