Talipes varus deformity right foot
Surgery
Spit spinal cord at T11-T12
No duplication of the dural sac or nerve roots
Diastematomyelia, fibrous septum
none
12 year old boy with "club" foot.
Fibrous septum was found at surgery.

Interestingly no associated deformity of the posterior elements of the bony spine are present at the level of the diastematomyelia.  If the cord had been duplicated, it would have been a "diplomyelia".
