Texto: 
Unknown, however as previously stated repair of an isolated, asymptomatic type I hiatal hernia is rarely indicated. If symptoms of GERD occur in association with a large hiatus hernia, either medical or surgical treatment is indicated to control the reflux.
In contrast, the enlarging types II, III, and IV hernias pose a constant risk of serious complications and should be treated surgically even in the absence of symptoms.
PA and lateral radiographs of the chest. 
FINDINGS:
-There is near complete opacification of the left hemidiaphragm. There is consolidation and/or atelectasis with accompanying effusion present on the 
left. Small right basilar opacities are present with a small right effusion. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is stable.  A 
large hiatal hernia is present. Calcifications are seen within the thoracic aorta. The remainder of the visualized bones and soft tissues are remarkable 
for degenerative changes to the acromioclavicular joint and spine.  
 
IMPRESSION: 
1. LEFT LUNG BASE CONSOLIDATION AND/OR ATELECTASIS WITH ACCOMPANYING EFFUSION WITH SMALLER BASILAR RIGHT OPACITY AND EFFUSION.  
2. LARGE HIATAL HERNIA.  


CT chest PE protocol.  
FINDINGS:  
-The study is somewhat limited by motion artifact.  The mediastinal, hilar and pulmonary parenchyma vasculature appear widely patent and normal in
course, caliber and contour without evidence of filling defects. There is a large hiatal hernia.  Otherwise, there are no mediastinal or hilar masses
identified, and no adenopathy is evident. Atherosclerotic calcific changes of the aorta and coronary arteries are present. There is no evidence of
aneurysmal dilation. 
 
Left greater than right-sided simple-appearing pleural effusions are present with underlying compressive atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear and 
evenly aerated without evidence of mass, calcification or pulmonary parenchymal disease.  The airways appear normal, and no thickening is evident.  
 
Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are seen.  The visualized upper abdomen as well as the remainder of the visualized soft tissues and osseous structures are unremarkable.   
IMPRESSION: 
1. NO COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM.  
2. LEFT GREATER THAN RIGHT-SIDED SIMPLE-APPEARING PLEURAL EFFUSIONS WITH SUBJACENT COMPRESSIVE ATELECTASIS.  
3. LARGE HIATAL HERNIA.
