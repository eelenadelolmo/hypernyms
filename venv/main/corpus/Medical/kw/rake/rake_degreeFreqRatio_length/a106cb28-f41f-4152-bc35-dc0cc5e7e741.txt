Physical Exam: 
WT: 2.454kg, Length: 45cm, Head Circumference: 33cm, T: 37C, P: 114, RR: 32 and regular, BP: 70/38, SaO2: Upper 90’s on room air.
General: Caucasian female, appeared growth retarded.
HEENT: A small right parietal cephalohematoma was noted at birth.  Lower two central incisors present at birth. 
Chest: Grade 3/6 systolic murmur noted at apex
Abdomen: Soft without organomegaly.
Genetalia: Normal female genitalia with a patent anus
Spine: Slight fullness in sacral region without a notable sacral dimple.
Musculoskeletal: Slight decrease in abduction of the right hip.
Otherwise, the physical exam was unremarkable.

Laboratory Data: (From day #1 of life)
CBC: Hgb 10.9, Hct 31, WBC 18,300; Plt 329,000. 
BMP: Na 137, K 4.3, Cl 107, CO2 25, BUN 8, Cr 0.7, Glucose 87, Ca 7.4
Total bilirubin 3.4
PT 13.8, PTT 39.4
Blood for karyotype and high resolution chromosomes sent for analysis. Final chromosome analysis (FISH) revealed a deletion of 7q11.23 revealing a diagnosis of Williams Syndrome. 
Pre-operative AFP: 105,898 
Pre-operative BHCG: 2  (Normal <5)
Pre-op CEA: 1.6 (Normal <5.1)
Post-op AFP: 46,950
This patient had a successful, complete surgical resection of the mass and coccyx on day #4 of life. She is currently 3 years-old and her AFP has remained within normal limits since surgery.
1. AP and Lateral Lumbar Spine X-rays revealed an air-filled rectum displaced anteriorly by a presacral soft tissue mass. The vertebral bodies and posterior elements of the lumbar spine itself were normal. There were 5 ossified sacral segments without an identified coccyx present on the lateral view.

2. MR of the Lumbar Spine without contrast revealed a septated cystic mass present anterior to the spine and posterior to the rectum measuring 5cm in length and 2.5 x 3.3cm in diameter. There was no evidence of solid tissue within the mass, and no enhancement after the injection of contrast material. The conus medullaris terminates at L1-L2 without evidence of teathering. There was a suggestion of fluid signal extending from the mass to the spinal canal, with the possibility of a communicating tract between the mass and subarachnoid space. No ossification center for the coccyx was identified.

3. Lumbosacral Myelogram revealed no contrast entering the mass from the subarachnoid space.

4. CT Pelvis Without IV Contraast revealed a multilobulated, fluid-filled presacral mass without calcification or adipose tissue within the mass. The bladder and rectum were distended anteriorly by the presacral mass, and the coccyx was not present.

5. CT Abdomen and Pelvis With IV Contrast revealed normal upper abdominal organs. A horseshoe kidney was present without hydronephrosis. A cystic mass was again noted in the pelvis with the vertical demension measuring 5.7cm.

6. Portable CXR revealed normal position of the heart and aortic arch.
Sacrococcygeal Teratoma
• Sacrococcygeal teratoma
• Anterior meningocele
• Neurenteric cyst
• Duplication cyst
• Chordoma
• Rhabdomyosarcoma
This baby girl was delivered at 39 weeks by uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was uncomplicated; and, routine prenatal care was obtained throughout the pregnancy. At her 20 week ultrasound, it was noted that she had what appeared to be a horseshoe kidney and a presacral mass. After delivery, on day #1 of life, she was transferred to this facility for further evaluation and treatment of her presacral mass.
This is a classic case of sacrococcygeal teratoma that illustrates the value of prenatal ultrasound and diagnosis. Her 20 week ultrasound raised suspicion for a presacral mass, and as a result, she received an early diagnostic evaluation and successful treatment before the chance of increased malignancy developed.

There is no correlation between Williams syndrome and presacral coccygeal teratoma.
