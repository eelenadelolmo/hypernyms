Texto: 
Tachycardic.  Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Multiple entry wounds of LLE, distally neurologically intact, strong pedal pulses.
Angiography, embolectomy
• Plain radiographs of LLE:
Multiple hyperdense, sub-centimeter, jagged fragments in the soft tissue of the posterior left lower extremity.  No sign of osseous fracture or cortical disruption.

• CT of Thorax:
There is a cylindrically shaped, hyperdense metallic object obstructing a pulmonary artery supplying the right middle lung, dilated vascular markings proximal to the obstruction, peripheral atelectasis distal to obstruction.
Retained metallic fragment embolism
• PE
• fat embolus
• mercury embolus
• retained metallic fragment embolism
26 yo soldier, his helicopter was struck with small arms fire, wounded in left lower extremity.  Now has chest pain, shortness of breath, and tachycardia.
