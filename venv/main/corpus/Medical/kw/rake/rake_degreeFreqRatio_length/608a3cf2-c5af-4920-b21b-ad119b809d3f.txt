Texto: 
86 y/o well developed, but poorly nourished, demented male, who is a poor historian.  Does not appear to be in distress, however c/o of cough and poor apetite.  

Pulm:  Bilateral rales, and ronchi.  No wheezing, or stridor.
CV:  Irregular Rate and rythm, no rubs, or gallops, equal pulses X4.  
Skin:  Pale, warm and dry.
Abd:  NT/ND, + BS throughout.
Extremeties:  No edema noted, DTRs equal, strength and sensation equal and WNL.

Labs:  WBC 17.7, HGB 13.4, HCT 40.7, Plt 417.
Chem:  Na 144, K 3.9, CL 106, CO2 27, BUN 17, Cr1.35, Gluc 92, Alb 2.8
BC X2 Negative for organisms.
Resp Cx:  Candida 
Bronchoscopy:  Cells consistent with metastatic Squamous Cell Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.
Pt was determined to be inoperable, and not a good candidate for chemotherapy.  Pt was returned to Nursing Home as per family's wishes.
CXR:  Diffuse opacities throughout bilateral lungs indicative of a fibrotic process.  Multiple pulmonary nodules found throughout bilateral lung fields.

CT:  Multifocal nodular opacities throughout the bilateral lungs concerning for diffuse metastatic disease. Fibrotic changes with a lower lobe predominance at the representing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
Metastatic Squamous Cell Lung Cancer with Underlying Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
1.  Metastatic Non-small Cell lung cancer. 

2.  Metastatic small cell lung cancer. 

3.  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

4.  Pneumoconiosis (such as asbestosis, silicosis etc) this would depend on his exposure.

5.  Infection
86 y/o male with PMHX of HTN, Afib, hypothyroidism, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, dementia, and depression transferred by his assisted living facility for 3 week hx of decreased PO intake, dry cough, increased confusion, and more recently hypotension.  Admitted to the hospital for treatment of bilateral pneumonia and malnutrition.
On both CT slices there are good representative images of honeycombing with its characteristic peripheral location, no more than 3 cm into the lung parenchyma and with thick walled air filled cysts that are no more than 1-3cm in diameter.  This specific pattern suggests extensive lung fibrosis with alveolar destruction and will often result in a cystic appearance in pathology.
