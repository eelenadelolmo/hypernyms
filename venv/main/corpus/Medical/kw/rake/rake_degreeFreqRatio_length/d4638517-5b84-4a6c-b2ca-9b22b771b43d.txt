Multiplanar, multi-sequence MRI of brain without IV contrast.  Time-of-flight and contrast enhanced MRA of neck and intracranial vasculature with 3D reconstructions.
    - several small areas of restricted diffusion, two in the right temporal lobe and two in right posterior frontal lobe.  Areas have a small amount of associated T2 hyperintensity, most consistent with acute to subacute infarctions. Right frontal lobe lesions are gyroform.

DWI shows area of hyperintensity in right cerebral hemisphere

No evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis in the common carotids.
Stroke
Transient Ischemic Attack
Focal infection
Meningo-encephalitis
44yo RHD M with sudden onset of difficulty speaking, L facial droop and drooling.  Pt had difficulty forming words, slurred speech, and numbness in L face and arm.  Most of the reported symptoms resolved within 10 minutes, with slight numbess and tingling in the L corner of the mouth still present after 30-45 minutes.
The patient had a history of stage IV CKD and uncontrolled HTN and HLD which increased his risk for a stroke.  The patient presented with left sided symptoms, with radiological evidence of areas of ischemia in the right posterior frontal and temporal lobes, which are consistent with the patient's presentation.  Although the patient's symptoms were resolving after 45 minutes, there were findings on DWI consistent with infarction and therfore the diagnosis of stroke was made.  The patient's symptoms and radiological findings indicate involvement of middle cerebral artery.
