The main treatment for these cyst include surgery with curettage and packing and recently injection of steroids.  Reoccurence with steroids is evident in up to 20% and depending on the type of surgery reoccurrence is up to 40%.  No follow up in this case.
Within the right proximal humerus there is a lesion with a few septations, narrow transition, no chondro or ossific matrix, and periosteal reaction and callous formation.  There is also a fragment of bone at the inferior aspects of the lesion.  No associated soft tissue mass.  Cortical thinning is present.
simple bone cyst
Simple Bone Cyst, Brodie’s abcess, eosinophilic granuloma, and fibrous dysplasia
7 yo male with prior history (which is withheld) and increasing arm pain
This lesion is consistent with an unicameral, simple  or solitary bone cyst.  The periosteal reaction is from a prior fracture.  

Simple bone cysts are a common lesion of uncertain etiology.  Current hypothesis is a venous obstruction within the bone causing blockage of interstitial fluid drainage.  They typically occur in young boys less than 20 years old with the mean age of diagnosis at 8 years.  If they occur in adults, they typically occur in atypical locations such as the iliac wing or calcaneus.  These cysts are typically asymptomatic unless there is a fracture.  

Metaphysis of long tubular bones are favored with 56% in humerus, 27% in femur, and 6% tibia, and 3% calcaneus.  They are usually solitary lesions.  Metaphyseal located cysts that are adjacent to physis are considered active and may grow.  Those that are located away from the growth plate near the diaphysis are considered latent.  However, exceptions to this rule does occur.  

Simple bone cyst typically appear as  metaphyseal centrally located radiolucent lesion with cortical thinning, thin sclerotic rim and mild osseous expansion.  They may be multilocular.  Cysts typically have long axis that  parallels the parent tubular bone.  The fallen fragment sign as seen in this case, “virtually ensures accurate analysis of the radiographs”.

The main treatment for these cyst include surgery with curettage and packing and recently injection of steroids.  Reoccurence with steroids is evident in up to 20% and depending on the type of surgery reoccurrence is up to 40%.
