Texto: 
The above images all show findings consistent with the pts. known history of cystic fibrosis.  Both the chest x ray and CT images demonstrate increased air space, bronchial wall thickening and fibrosis and bronchiectasis.  
  The last image is post pulmonary transplant and does not show any of the known pathological findings assocated with lung transplant.
Cystic fibrosis and Lung Transplant
Important to note that hyperinflation and peribronchial cuffing can be seen in asthma, bronchiolitis caused by other infections, measles, pertussis, or obliterative bronchiolitis.  Linear streaking and scattered nodules may be present in granulomatoses, fungal disease or sarcoid.
pt has history of multiple respiratory infections from a young age
This pt appeared to being doing well in the immediate post op period. long term follow up will be required. It should be noted that although this case highlights the pulmonary system CF affects all exocrine organs.  The radiologist should be aware of the far reaching effects of this disease.  For example, there will be pancreatic abnormalites and bony abnormalities to be seen as well. On CT one can see the pancreas largely replaced by fat. Bony changes may include kyphosis, vertebral wedging and compresion fracture which may worsen pulmonary disease.
