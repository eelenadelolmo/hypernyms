Baastrup's Syndrome
While there is a wide differential for low back pain, this radiologic finding is virtually pathognomonic for Baastrup’s syndrome.
A 76 year old male with a past medical history significant for insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and stage 3 chronic kidney disease presented with mid to low right-sided back pain, exacerbated by lying on his right side.  There were no reported lower extremity weaknesses or paresthesias.  His musculoskeletal history includes chronic hip pain status post hip fracture.  His pain is managed without narcotics.  Imaging was performed to evaluate the etiology of his back pain.
The clinical syndrome of midline back pain and tenderness to palpation exacerbated by extension or hyperextension of the spine (and relieved by flexion or local anesthetic) was first described by J. F. Brailsford in 1929.  It was further characterized in 1933 by the Danish radiologist Christian Baastrup, and has been associated with his name since that time as Baastrup’s sign or Baastrup’s syndrome.  The finding was subsequently described by the Belgian rheumatologist Leon Michotte, and is also known as Michotte’s syndrome, kissing spine disease, arthrosis interspinosa, and spinous impingement syndrome.
While the etiology of this condition is unknown, there is likely some association with chronic postural hyperlordosis and occupational history of prolonged back flexion.  There may be some relation to excessive loss of disc spaces.

Baastrup described the disorder radiographically as "close approximation and contact of adjacent spinous processes and resultant enlargement, flattening, and reactive sclerosis of apposing interspinous surfaces."  Concurrent spinal lesions such as degenerative disk disease, spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, and posterior epidural cysts are common.  On histologic examination, a cavity, or "adventitious bursa." is often found in the interspinous space.  These apparently increase with age and are related to repeated shearing movement between adjacent spinous processes.  These bursae or cysts can cause varying degrees of compression of the thecal sac, and commonly show perivascular cellular infiltration consistent with inflammation, which is presumed to be the source of the midline back pain.

Radiography of the lumbrosacral spine can show the enlarged spinous processes and sclerosis of the opposing areas.  MRI may be necessary to eliminate other diagnoses as the etiology of low back pain.  MR investigation in Baastrup’s reveals edema and inflammation in and around the spinous processes.  This may be best visualized on fat-supressed T2 or post contrast T1 sequences.

As relief with local anesthesia is a defining characteristic of the syndrome, it is logically an acceptable treatment.  Fluroscopically-guided direct injection of an anesthetic and steroid mixture between the affected spinous processes can be therapeutic and diagnostic.  Surgical excision of the involved spinous processes may be required if sufficient pain relief is not obtained with anesthesia, and is the definitive treatment.
