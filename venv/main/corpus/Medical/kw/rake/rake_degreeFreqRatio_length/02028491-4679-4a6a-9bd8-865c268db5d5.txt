Pertinent Lab Results:
Cocaine Screen, DOA (Urine) Negative         
Opiate Screen, DOA (Urine) Positive    
THC Screen, DOA (Urine) Positive    
BNP  17 pg/ml
The patient's condition deteriorated and he was transferred to a University hospital.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. There are bilateral patchy diffuse airspace opacities predominantly in the mid to upper lung fields compatible with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
Noncardiogenic Pulmonary Edema
• Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema
• Cardiogenic pulmonary edema
• Allergic reaction
• Lymphangitic spread
A 17 year-old male was brought to the emergency department after a heroin overdose, by the EMS.
Pulmonary edema is one of the most frequent life threatening medical emergencies. 

Pulmonary edema is defined as an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the extravascular compartments of the lung. 

Three mechanisms lead to pulmonary edema. 
1. Increased hydrostatic gradient 
2. Diminished oncotic pressure 
3. Increased capillary permeability due to endothelial damage 

Pulmonary edema is due to the movement of excess fluid into the alveoli as a result of a shift in one or more of these mechanisms. 

The causes of pulmonary edema are generally categorized as cardiac versus non-cardiac. Reduced cardiac function will cause increased hydrostatic pressures in the pulmonary capillary bed resulting in cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema can result from volume overload due to renal failure, over hydration, or from diminished oncotic pressure in a liver failure patient, or from endothelial injury as in a patient suffering from a heroin overdose.

The chest film may play a role in distinguishing cardiac versus non-cardiac forms of pulmonary edema. 

Cardiac edema is usually characterized by cardiac enlargment, pleural effusions, pulmonary vascular redistribution to the upper lobes, Kerley's lines, peribronchial cuffing, no significant loss of lung volume, and basal edema.

In noncardiogenic pulmonary edema there is no cardiomegaly, but otherwise the pattern of interstitial and alveolar edema may be difficult to differentiate. Redistribution of blood flow and peribronchial cuffing may be missing. 

Causes of noncardiac pulmonary edema can be memorized through the mnemonic NOT CARDIAC: 
• Near drowing 
• Oxygen therapy 
• Transfusion or Trauma (fat embolism)
 
• Central nervous system disorder 
• Allergic alveolitis 
• Renal failure 
• Drugs 
• Inhaled toxins 
• Aspiration or ARDS or Altitude sickness 
• Contusion

Heroin induced pulmonary edema is seen in about 15% of cases of heroin overdose with an overall mortality rate of 10%. Heroin overdose can cause depression of the medullary respiratory center and lead to hypoxia and acidosis, both of which cause permeability edema without diffuse alveolar disease.

The absence of diffuse alveolar disease can be directly inferred from the swift declaration of the disorder observed in all cases that are not complicated by aspiration of gastric contents or by infection. 

Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema seconday to heroin overdose as seen in the case of our unlucky 17 year-old, manifests as extensive, patchy, bilateral airspace consolidations, indistinct vessels, and peribronchial cuffing.  

When heroin-induced pulmonary edema is not coupled with renal insufficiency or other complications such as aspiration of gastric contents, rapid resolution observed within 1 or 2 days with no parenchymal sequelae.
