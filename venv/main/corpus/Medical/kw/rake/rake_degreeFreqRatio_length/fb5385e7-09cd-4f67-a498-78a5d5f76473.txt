53 year old woman with Marfan Syndrome.  She presents now with sudden onset of chest pain.
There is a history of debate as to whether Marfan's syndrome is associated with intracranial aneurysms.  Marfan's results from a defect in fibrillin, which is a glycoprotein that is a major component of microfibrils.  The microfibrils are distributed in the elastic tissues (including arterial walls) throughout the body suggesting their defect could result in aneurysm development. 

Several case reports have described intracranial aneurysms in Marfan's patients, and this lead to a variety of studies.  A neuropathologic study by Schievink et al of 7 Marfan's patients found intracranial aneurysms in 2.  However, this study was limited by small population size.  Another study by van den Berg et al of 135 patients in a Marfan's clinic did not find an increase in symptomatic intracranial aneurysms based on absence of subarachnoid hemorrhage; however, no neuroimaging was performed. In 1999, a study by Conway et al, reviewed autopsy results in 25 confirmed Marfan's patients.  Only one of these patients had an intracranial aneurysm, which they report is not statistically different from the general autopsy population. Their conclusion was that there is no increased prevalence of intracranial aneurysms in Marfan's patients, and these patients do not require routine screening of the intracranial vasculature.

In addition,  Murdoch et al evaluated of the cause of death of 56 Marfan's patients, none of which was from intracranial aneurysm.    These patients typically have a shorter life expectancy (mean 39 years, median 38 years in one autopsy series).  Aortic dissection, aortic rupture or cardiac failure due to mitral and aortic valve regurgitation are reported as the main causes of patient death.
