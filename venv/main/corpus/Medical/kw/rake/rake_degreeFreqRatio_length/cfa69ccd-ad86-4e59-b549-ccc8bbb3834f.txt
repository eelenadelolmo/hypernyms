Texto: 
Physical exam unremarkable except for decreased sensation of right hand and forearm to fine touch with intact pinpoint and 2 point discrimination and decreased right upper extremity strength (3/5) compared to left upper extremity.
Patient was evaluated and observed in the ER.  Approximately four hours after presentation, patient noted improvement of symptoms despite lack of significant medical intervention.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Findings consistent with Chiari I malformation including displacement of the cerebellar tonsils approximately 1 cm below the foramen magnum and syrinx of the spinal cord.
2.  No evidence of significant foraminal narrowing, disc herniations or compression of the visualized neuraxis.
3.  Visualization of previously described anterior inferior T9 vertebral body fracture with no evidence of edema.  Age undetermined.
Syrinx associated with Chiari I Malformation
• Spinal cord lesion
• Nerve root compression
• Entrapment neuropathy
• Multiple sclerosis
• Thoracic outlet syndrome
• Brachial plexus neuropathy
• Transient ischemic attack
19 year old female who presented to the ER S/P motor vehicular accident 4 days prior to presentation with known T9 fracture after post accident evaluation, now complains of new acute onset of right upper extremity paresthesia and paralysis.
While a patient's history and physical examination often guide the clinician towards specific radiological testing and focus on certain differential diagnoses, it is important to remember to keep an open-mind when evaluating radiological tests since incidental findings are often found during imaging.

Chiari I malformation, as defined by tonsillar ectopia located below the foramen magnum, is being increasingly identified as a result of advances in MR imaging. Chiari I is by far the most common of the Chiari malformations. The Chiari type I malformation was first identified in 1891 by pathologist Hans Chiari. It is an uncommon and complex neuromuscular deformity that is present at birth.

Chiari type 1 malformations (CM1) occur in the region where the brain and the spinal cord join. In this disorder, the portions of the brain called the cerebellum and/or brainstem lie lower than usual. Often, the cerebellar tonsils protrudes out of the base of the skull into the spinal canal. This protrusion causes pressure in the brain, contributing to the symptoms people experience. The exact cause of CM1 is not known. Etiologic theories include embyologic anomaly of craniocervical junction, intrauterine tonsillar herniation due to hydrocephalus, or acquired deformity from platybasia/basilar invagination. Associations include hydromyelia (25-60%), basilar invagination (25-50%), C2-3 fusion (18%), AO fusion (10%), cervical occulta (5%), Klippel-Feil (5%).  Some CM1 cases are believed to be present at birth.  There are many symptoms associated with CM1. These symptoms may include headaches, especially at the base of the skull, dizziness, double vision, weakness in the arms, and/or difficulty walking. When symptoms are present, they are often vague or nonspecific. As a result, the diagnosis of CM1 is often delayed until more severe symptoms present themselves or after current symptoms persist for some time.

Many people with the Chiari I malformation experience no symptoms. When symptoms are present, they usually do not appear until adolescence or early adulthood, but can occasionally be seen in young children. The majority of patients complain of severe head and neck pain. Headaches are often accentuated by coughing, sneezing or straining. Patients may complain of dizziness, vertigo, disequilibrium, muscle weakness or balance problems. Often fine motor skills and hand coordination will be affected.

Vision problems can also occur. Some patients experience blurred or double vision, difficulty in tracking objects or a hypersensitivity to bright lights. Physical examination may reveal nystagmus (involuntary eye movements). Other symptoms include tinnitus (buzzing or ringing in the ear), hearing loss or vocal cord paralysis. Patients may have difficulty swallowing, frequent gagging and choking and, in some cases, sleep apnea may be present.

Some people with Chiari I malformation also have a syrinx or syringomyelia. This is a long cavity containing CFS within the spinal cord. This condition is not always associated with Chiari I malformation and may also be associated with spinal cord trauma, meningitis, arachnoiditis, tethered spinal cord, or tumors. The cause of a syrinx is unknown. There is some evidence that the normal flow of CSF is blocked because the cerebellar tonsils have descended into the posterior fossa. This blockage causes the CFS to flow abnormally, creating an abnormal pathway in the spinal cord.

Treatment is aimed at correcting the condition that allowed the syrinx to form, if possible. In cases involving a Chiari Malformation, the main goal of surgery is to provide more space for the cerebellum at the base of the skull and upper cervical spine. This often results in a flattening or disappearance of the syrinx as the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid is restored. In some cases it may be necessary to insert a shunt into the cavity, rerouting the cerebrospinal fluid from the spinal cord. A successful surgery will stabilize the condition and perhaps gain a modest improvement in symptoms, but over time surgery is not always successful and multiple surgeries may be necessary.
