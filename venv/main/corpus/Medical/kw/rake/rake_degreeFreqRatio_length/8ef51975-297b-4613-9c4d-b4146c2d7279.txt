MRI was recommended anticipating subsequent surgical resection.
A large hyperdense extraaxial mass with hypodense cystic regions fills the right middle cranial fossa in the area of the sphenoid ridge.  The mass involves the skull base and indents the right frontotemporal parenchyma with local mass-effect and edema with protrusion into the right lateral ventricle and compression of the upper aspect of the right midbrain.  Basal cisterns and lateral ventricles remain open.  There has been bony remodeling and scalloping of the skull base.  Calcification and hyperostosis are also present.  There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Suspected meningioma
Meningioma, malignant meningioma, metastasis.
Middle aged white male status post motor vehicle accident after passing out at the wheel in stable and lucid condition.  Patient is a civilian trauma who is ineligible for care follow-up and definitive care at our military institution.
Unfortunately, this patient was not eligible for care at a military institution and a non-contrast enhanced axial CT scan of the head was the only study performed.  It is thought that this slow growing tumor (suspected meningioma) was responsible for this patient's loss of consciousness and subsequent motor vehicle accident.
