No abnormal physical exam findings were noted on exam.  The exam was limited secondary to poor cooperation and comprehension.
This chronic pericardial effusion proved unresponsive to anti-inflammatory medications.  Pt’s first echo was performed in shortly after this CT scan, noting moderate undifferentiated circumferential pericardial effusion.  Four additional echos over the next year showed similar findings.  Pt will continue to be followed by endocrinology for hypothyroidism.  Pt will continue to be followed by cardiology with repeat echocardiography and assessment for signs and symptoms of enlarging pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade, although the literature supports that he will likely remain stable and asymptomatic.
CXR showed borderline cardiomegaly.  Chest CT showed large pericardial effusion.  The pericardium is not thickened.
Pericardial Effusion
Pediatric ericardial effusion:

Hypothyroidism
Down’s syndrome 
Viral infection 
Autoimmune disease
Idiopathic
Cough.
The most likely explanation for this patient's chronic pericardial effusion is hypothyroidism and Down's syndrome (trisomy 21).  The presence of hypothyroidism in Down's syndrome has been well documented.  However, a high incidence of isolated pericardial effusion, without hypothyroidism, has also been documented among Down's syndrome patients, in Concolino et al.  It has been shown that large pericardial effusion with children who are hypothyroid and Down’s syndrome often resolves on its own without treatment in Werder et al.  Additionally, tamponade is extremely rare in these patients.  If the patient remains asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable, he is unlikely to require invasive treatment for his effusion.
