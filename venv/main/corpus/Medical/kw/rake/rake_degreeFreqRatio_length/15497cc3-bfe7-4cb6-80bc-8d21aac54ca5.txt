Texto: 
Multilobulated lesion at right distal femoral metaphysis.  Increased radiotracer uptake on scintigram at site of lesion, along with increased uptake in the left knee in a pattern suggestive of arthropathic change.
Nonossifying Fibroma
Radiographic appearance is characteristic of nonossifying fibroma.
Pt with prolonged pain in left knee for 6 months, worse with exercise.
This patient is outside of the typical age range for NOF, but the plain radiographic appearance is characteristic.
