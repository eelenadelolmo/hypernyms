CSF EBV titers - positive
CD4 count - 67
Steroids and Radiotherapy.  Follow-up images obtained one week later demonstrated no change.
FLAIR images demonstrate massive edema in the left cerebral cortex with a mixed signal lesion.  Mass effect again is noted in the sagittal T1 weighted image, impressing upon the cingulate gyrus.  Post-gadolinium enhanced T1 weighted axial images demonstrate a ring enhancing lesion with hypointense central region with maximal dimensions of 2.6 x 3.1 cm.
