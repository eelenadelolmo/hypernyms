1,2) CC, MLO views left breast 0600 position posterior one/third demonstrates linear pleomorphic calcifications.
3.4) MAG CC, MLO images better demonstrate the abnormal calcifications.
Benign breast calcifications
Indeterminate cluster of calcifications:
1) DCIS
2) Atypical ductal hyperplasia
3) Degenerating fibroadenoma
4) Infarcted papilloma
5) Fat necrosis
6) Benign cluster of calcifications
67 year old female with calcifications in the left breast 0600 position on screening mammography.
Mammographically these calcifications do not have typically benign features (see attached 'Factoid').A linear array distribution and pleomorphic in configuration, these calcifications instead fall into a category of "suspicious calcifications, indeterminate cluster". A stereotactic biopsy of these calcifications was performed. The area was well-sampled. 

In conclusion, this is a path-proven benign calcifications. Importantly, benign calcifications are still in the differential though the mammographic features are inconsistent. Tissue sampling is the only way to make the diagnosis in this case.
