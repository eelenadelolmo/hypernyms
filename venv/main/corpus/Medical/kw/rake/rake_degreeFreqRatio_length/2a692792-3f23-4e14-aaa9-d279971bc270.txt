None - incidental finding, if less than 4 cm unlikely to hemorrhage. Large or symptomatic lesions are resected or embolized.
Axial CT image through the kidneys without and with IV contrast demonstrates a large heterogeneous exophytic mass in the mid pole of the left kidney with focal regions of hypodensity corresponding to macroscopic fat.  The lesion enhances heterogeneously and displaces the renal parenchyma.  There is stranding of the perirenal fat.

54 Female with questionable renal lesion on outside ultrasound.
Angiomyolipoma (AML) is a benign, well marginated, nonencapsulated hamartomatous renal neoplasm composed of fat, vascular, and smooth muscle elements. Most extend beyond the renal capsule. Usually solitary, isolated AML is more common in women of childbearing age.

Fat is hypodense on CT (HU < - 50), hyperechoic on Ultrasound, and hyperintense on MR T1, confirmed with fat suppression. Demonstration of fatty attenuation in a renal tumor on CT is virtually diagnostic of an AML.  Case reports exist of renal cell carcinomas or oncocytomas with engulfed fat that appear to have foci of fat density on CT.  Nonfatty AMLs are rare.  If calcification present consider RCC. 

Associations:  
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis
40% with AML have Tuberous sclerosis
80% with Tuberous sclerosis have AML, multiple and bilateral

Complications: Spontaneously hemorrhage or hemorrhage with trauma, may be massive.  Absence of elastic tissue in the tumor vessels predisposes the patient to aneurysm formation and spontaneous hemorrhage, if less than 4 cm unlikely to hemorrhage. Large or symptomatic lesions are resected or embolized
