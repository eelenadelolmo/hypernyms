Vitals: Temp 38.6, BP 90/57, HR 102, RR 14
There was frank pus within the oral cavity, few mandibular teeth remained anteriorly.  Significant erythema and induration were noted overlying his neck and upper chest bilaterally.

ESR: 30 mm/hr
The patient was taken to the operating room for incision and drainage of neck abscesses and mediastinal exploration.  He remained in critical condition, intubated and sedated, and was spiking regular fevers.  The patient was again taken to the operating room for drainage and continued postoperative care in the SICU.  The patient’s condition improved and he was transferred to the floor.  No wound, blood, or urine cultures yielded growth of any organisms.  He underwent 2 further weeks of IV antibiotics and continued wound packing twice daily.  The patient was afebrile upon discharge.
CT of the neck demonstrates multiple abscesses (some gas-containing) in the retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, submandibular, and anterior visceral spaces, as well as the anterior mediastinum.

A 25 year-old male with a past medical history significant only for psychiatric problems presents to an outside hospital with neck swelling, trismus, dysphagia, and difficulty breathing.  Two months prior to presentation, he had multiple teeth extracted for dental caries.  He was started on meropenem, vancomycin, and metronidazole and transferred to our institution for further management.
