Protected weight bearing with crutches, analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and physical therapy focusing on strengthening the quadriceps and hamstrings.
Radiographs
- Subchondral sclerosis
- Subtle articular surface collapse
- Effusion

MRI
-T1: 
Area of subchondral decreased signal intensity indicating necrosis
-T2:
Diffuse increased signal intensity indicating edema.

May have linear serpiginous low signal indicating fracture.
May show flattening of the articular surface indicating collapse.


MRI
Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee
-Subchondral Fracture
-Osteoarthritis
-Osteochondritis Dissecans (OCD)
-Stress Response/Fracture 
-Spontaneous Osteonecrosis of the Knee (SONK)
The patient presented with right knee pain and swelling of two week duration.  No history of trauma.
Radiographic images originally read in the Emergency Department may have been suggestive of SONK due to articular surface flattening. (early collapse)
