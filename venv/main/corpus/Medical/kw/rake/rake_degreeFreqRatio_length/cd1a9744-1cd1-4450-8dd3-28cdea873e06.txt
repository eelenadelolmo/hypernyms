Known history of severe RA.
Medical therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications.
Severe erosion of  the base of the dens with some erosion in the superior portions as well.  There is asymmetry in the lateral atlanto-dens relations consistent with a mild subluxation.  The lateral cervical spine view demonstrates discogenic degenerative changes and loss of the normal cervical lordosis.  The atlanto-dens interval is 3mm.  Flexion and extension views were not obtained but should be performed prior to completing a pre-operative assessment.   A single radiograph of the hands demonstrates many of the stigmata of rheumatoid arthritis:  severe erosive changes at the radio-ulnar joints, throughout the carpal bones and at the metacarpal heads and subluxations
Rheumatoid Arthritis, atlanto-axial subluxation with erosive changes at the dens
Rheumatoid arthritis
55 y.o. woman with rheumatoid arthritis, preoperative evaluation.
In rheumatoid arthritis the cervical spine is commonly involved, particularly and most significantly at C1-2.  The most frequently noted complication is atlanto-occipital subluxation.  The normal atlanto-dens interval is 2.5 mm.  Patients with subluxation exceed this measure but are often without symptoms until the interval is closer to 9mm.  Flexion increases this distance while it is reduced with extension.  Other complications include atlantoaxial impaction due to bilateral C1-2 facet erosion, torticollis due to unilateral facet erosion and odontoid erosion.  This case is a good illustration of odontoid erosion.
