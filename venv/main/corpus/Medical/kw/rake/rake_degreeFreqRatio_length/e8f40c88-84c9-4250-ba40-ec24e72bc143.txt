Cardio, Pulm, Abdominal exam were all unremarkable.
L fifth digit swollen. Non tender to palpation, but range of motion limited secondary to swollen size. Non erythematous. No overlying skin changes. Sensation intact. Radial pulse palpable.
Enchondromas are treated expectantly, and may be followed serially to rule out aggressive transformation (2,3,7). Pathologic fractures are often treated non-operatively, with immobilization (2,3). Surgical management may be explored if there is concern for future fractures, symptomatic findings, and/or fear of malignancy. Curettage with or without bone grafting, followed by immobilization, physical therapy, and serial radiographs (at the 3,5, and 12 month mark in both operative and non-operative patients) may be done in these settings (2,3,7). Therapies like high speed burring or alcohol instillation are not recommended (7).
Fracture through the 5th proximal phalanx.  Underlying lytic lesion with bone expansion and endosteal scalloping
Enchondroma
Enchondroma
Bone Infarct (but no pain/ known mechanism or risk factor)

Infection (no systemic symptoms or mechanism for infection)
HPI: 
A 26yo Active Duty man presents to his Battalion Medical Officer following an injury during combatives training. He states that his finger was caught between his opponent?s helmet and the ground. It was initially painful and swollen, but the pain has since subsided. He has no previous injuries to his finger and other symptoms.  
To rule out a fracture, a hand X-Ray was obtained. The following image was noted.
He presents to your clinic for work up of hand finding.

PMH: Unremarkable
PSH: R inguinal hernia repair
Meds: Multi-vitamins; Pre-workout
Fam History: Breast cancer in mother; Prostate cancer in grand father
These benign, osteolytic tumors appear as "well defined areas of central lucency in the metaphyseal or diaphyseal portion of the bone (1)." Other findings associated with enchondromas include endosteal scalloping, thinning, stippling, and punctate calcifications (2,3). Of note, larger lesions-specifically those in the hand- tend to occur further away from the growth plate possibly due to ?earlier development and migration(2).?

Enchondromas are benign intramedullary bone tumors that are believed to arise from cartilaginous fragments near the central physis (3). Other theories with respect to their development include Jaffe?s hypothesis which postulates that embryonic cartilaginous cells from the epiphyseal plate are displaced during normal growth, continue to develop, and become enchondromas in the area in which they settle (1). Molecular studies have shown that there is some association with the genes IDH1 and IDH2 (1, 4). 

Epidemiologically, enchondromas are the second most common benign bone tumor found in children/adolescents (with osteochondromas leading the way), accounting for up to 24% of such tumors (1). They occur equally in men and women; and account for 12%-14% of benign bone tumors and 3%-10% of all bone tumors in the general population (3). Studies have shown that 35% of enchondromas arise in the hand, with 50% of these arising in the proximal phalanx (as in our patient). Enchondromas typically arise in the hands and feet, but have also been reported in the femur, tibiam, calcaneus, and atlas (1,4,5).

Clinical Presentation and malignant transformation:
These benign tumors are usually asymptomatic and found incidentally on radiographic examination (1,2,3,5). On occasion, the bone loss can lead to pathologic fractures (2). Pain and aggressive progression are atypical and warrants close monitoring/ further work up. Though malignant transformation of solitary enchondromas is exceedingly rare (1), two syndromes should that should be kept in mind are Ollier Disease (multiple enchondromas in several bones) and Maffucci Syndrome (multiple enchondromas and hemangiomas) (6). These two diseases/syndromes have been associated with higher malignant transformation rates to chondrosarcoma, and in Maffucci Syndrome, non-skeletal tumors like astrocytomas and granulosa-cell ovarian tumor (6).

Histologic Findings:
Enchondromas can be confirmed via histology. They are associated with lobulated cartilaginous tissue with ?banal-appearing chondrocytes arranged in clustered lacunae with a background of abundant hyaline cartilage matrix (1).? Chondrocytes nuclei are of different sizes and may be binucleate. These may be hypo- or hypercellular, but are not associated with mitoses.
