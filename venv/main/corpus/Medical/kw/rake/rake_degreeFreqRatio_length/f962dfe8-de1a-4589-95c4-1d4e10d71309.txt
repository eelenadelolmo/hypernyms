Surgical debridement, subsequent antibiotic therapy, and wound care.
The patient has a large right scalp fluid collection with surrounding edema and contrast enhancement highly suspicious for infection. Underlying scalp fluid collection. There is significant bone marrow edema and enhancement of the right frontal bone - consistent with osteomyelitis. Also, there is enhancement of the right frontal high convexity, which is suspicious for meningeal involvement of the infection. 

Intracranially, there is no abnormality seen and no  intracranial abscess identified. No evidence of hemorrhage. The ventricles, cisternal spaces and sulci are all within normal limits. No mass or mass effect identified. No midline shift.
Acute skull osteomyelitis following peri-orbital cellulitis
• osteomyelitis
• subgaleal empyema
• trauma
• tumor
This 12-year-old girl was sent to the Emergency Department for right frontal scalp swelling. Parents relate a prolonged illness over the last month starting with right periorbital cellulitis. This was treated for four days with IM Rocephin and oral antibiotics and subsequently resolved.
Parents relate a prolonged illness over the last month starting with right periorbital cellulitis. This was treated for four days with IM Rocephin and p.o. antibiotics and subsequently resolved.

Approximately two weeks after initial treatment, the parents noticed some swelling over the patient's right forehead and frontal skull with some minimal right periorbital swelling again. The patient was again started on Rocephin and p.o. antibiotics but the swelling gradually increased.  The patient has had pain that has been controlled by frequent Tylenol with codeine and Motrin. There has been no recent noted fever, vomiting, eye pain, visual difficulties, or headache.
