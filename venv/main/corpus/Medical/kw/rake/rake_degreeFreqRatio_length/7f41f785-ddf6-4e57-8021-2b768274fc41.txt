There is mild diffuse swelling about the left ankle and point tenderness to palpation over the base of the left fifth metatarsal bone.
Placement of a short-leg weight-bearing cast for 6 weeks.
AP, oblique and lateral views of the left foot demonstrate a subtle transverse fracture lucency through the base of the fifth metatarsal at a distance of approximately 5 mm from the tip of the tuberosity.  Note that the transverse fracture line is extra-articular and just proximal to the level of the metatarsocuboid joint.  There is mild adjacent soft tissue swelling.
Articular avulsion fracture,  fifth metatarsal base
Lesion at the base of the 5th metatarsal
<li>Jones fracture
<li>Normal apophysis
<li>Avulsion of peroneus brevis tendon
<li>Sesamoid bone
A 22-year-old man sustained an inversion injury to his left foot one day prior to presentation.
OK, this is a Radiologic diagnosis and there really is not much of a differential diagnosis.  Please refer to the accompanying topic.
