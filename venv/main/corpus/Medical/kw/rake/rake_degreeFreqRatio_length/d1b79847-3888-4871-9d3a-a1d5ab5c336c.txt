ACE 55; normal 9-67.  Per report, patient had a positive ENA from outside facility.
Patient was treated with a tapering dose of prednisone and is being followed by pulmonary clinic.
Plain chest films demonstrate bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy with right paratracheal lymphadenpathy suggestive of sarcoid.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion
seen.  Pulmonary vasculature demonstrates normal caliber and distribution.  Surrounding soft tissues and osseous structures are unremarkable.  Cardiac silhouette is normal.
Sarcoid
Sarcoid
Lymphoma
Tuberculosis or other oppurtunistic/fungal disease
Sjogrenâ€™s Syndrome with coexistent adenopathy
Patient is a 42-year african american active duty First Sergeant.  Patient presented with bilateral parotitis, conjunctivitis, xerostomia and shortness of breath.
Sarcoid is a systemic disorder of unkown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomatous inflammation, particularly of the lungs.  Onset of the disease is most common during the third and fourth decades.  It is more common in African Americans and women.  The chest radiograph will be abnormal in a majority of patients at some point in their disease.  The chest radiographs of this patient demonstrated the classic radiographic appearance of sarcoid, which is right paratracheal and symmetric bilateral hilar lymph node enlargement.
