Abdomen is rigid and distended.
Patient was taken emergently to the operating room for bowel repair but unfortunately did not survive.
Portable Abdomen from 11/29/03
NG tube in stomach, UVC tip at the level of the right atrium.  Multiple air filled loops of bowel without evidence for pneumatosis intestinalis, free intraperitoneal air or portal venous gas.
Portable Abdomen from 12/04/03 @ 12:15 AM after abdomen becoming rigid and worsening clinical course.
Worsening bowel loop distension with branching tubular lucencies seen in the liver.  Additionally there is a suggestion of abnormal lucency seen in the wall of a few bowel loops which may be early pneumatosis intestinalis.  No evidence for free peritoneal air.  
Portable Abdomen from 12/04.03 @ 1:30 pm
Serial follow up exams every 4 hours showed slight progression of pneumatosis.  No free air was seen until this exam.  Again identified is air within the wall of the bowel.  Portal venous gas not as easily visualized. Additionally there is air seen outlining the falciform ligament (“Footbal sign”) and air seen on two sides of multiple bowel loops (“Rigler’s Sign”) indicating free intra-peritoneal air from a perforated bowel loop.
Cross Table Lateral from 12/04/03 @1:30 pm
Confirms free air from perforated bowel.
Necrotizing Enterocolitis
1. Necrotizing enterocolitis
2. Hypoxic enterocolitis (from shock)
3. Infectious enterocolilitis
Premature NICU baby with progressive abdominal distension/rigidity and worsening clinical course.
