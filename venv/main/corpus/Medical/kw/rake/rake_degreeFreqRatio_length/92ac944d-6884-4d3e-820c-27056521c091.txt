Erythematous, edematous, painful L 5th digit.  Pt able to fully extend/flex digit actively with/without resistance.
Left 5th digit splinted
Transverse fracture of base of distal phalanx of L 5th digit.
Transverse fracture of base of distal phalanx of L 5th digit.
Transverse fracture of base of distal phalanx of L 5th digit.
Pt was exercising with medicine ball.  Pt's finger was caught under medicine ball when it hit the ground.
This patient, with a simple, nondisplaced transverse phalangeal fracture,  received an alumafoam splint for stabilization.  The fracture is not immediately apparent on the PA view, but is clear on the lateral view.  When reviewing the PA after viewing the lateral, a very subtle nonlinear transverse lucency can be viewed at the base of the distal phalanx.
