Laboratory examination was remarkable for elevated alkaline phosphatase.
The medical management and possibility of malignant degeneration requires periodic clinical followup often with radiographs.
Radiograph over the pelvis demonstrates cortical thickening and osseous expansion of the left proximal femur.  Delayed scintigraphic images after injection with Tc99m MDP demonstrates intensely increased radiotracer uptake in the left femur.
