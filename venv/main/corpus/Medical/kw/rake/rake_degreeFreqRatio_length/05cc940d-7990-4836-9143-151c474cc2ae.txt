Exophthalmos on PE.  Low TSH and High T4.
Non Contrast Face CT in axial and coronal planes show diffuse enlargement of the bodies of the extraocular muscles, with sparing of the tendinous insertions.

Pseudotumor and lymphoma are classically given as differential considerations.  Sparing of tendinous insertions suggests thyroid etiology, as do the TSH/FT4 levels obviously.
Presents to ED with headaches and nervousness.
