Texto: 
Fussy, coughing child.  Upper airway noise on exam, otherwise unremarkable exam.  Pulse oximetry within normal limits.
Supportive therapy including parental education and instructions for return to ER if respiratory problems arose.  No antibiotics were given.
The lungs are clear without consolidation or pleural effusion. There
is no pneumothorax. The cardiothymic silhouette is within normal limits.

There is narrowing of the upper airway on the frontal projection, the 'steeple sign' with loss of normal shouldering, consistent with Croup.  Some air-trapping or 'balloooning' within the hypopharynx is present on the lateral projection, also consistent with Croup.
 
Lateral soft tissue neck study demonstrates no significant swelling of the epiglottis. The visualized osseous and soft tissue structures are
unremarkable.
Croup
• Croup
• Epiglottitis
• Foreign Body Aspiration
• Retropharyngeal Abscess
• Laryngomalacia
19 month-old girl with cough.  Parents note fever.
There may be some association of Croup with later onset of asthma.
