Texto: 
Tenderness to palpation in the region of the right hip and decreased range of motion of the hip.
Abnormally increased radiotracer uptake in the right proximal femur, calvarium, left foot and spine consistent with metastatic disease.  (Possible metastatic disease is present in the right superior pubic ramus and the right acetabulum). The pattern of uptake in the right proximal femur is concerning for a pathologic fracture.

Lytic lesions in the right proximal femur and left foot on plain films.
Metastatic bone disease
-Metastatic disease
-Trauma
-Paget disease
-Osteomyelitis
-Fibrous dysplasia
A 55 year-old male with stage IV lung cancer presenting with two weeks of right groin pain.
-Pathologic fracture of the right hip secondary to metastatic disease.
-Unusual metastatic spread to appendicular skeleton.
