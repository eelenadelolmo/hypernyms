Physical Exam and Laboratory: 
Abnormal gait (No other information available)
Treatment and Follow-up: 
Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms only.   Longitudinal arch supports may relieve mild symptoms. More intense symptoms can be treated with a below-the-knee cast, which may also decrease the duration of symptoms.  The disease is self-limited with no sequelae.  Treatment has no effect on disease outcome except perhaps to decrease the duration of  symptoms.  Patients should be followed with serial radiographs.
Image Findings: 
A-P, mortise, and lateral radiographs showed flattened navicular with heterogeneous sclerotic appearance. Adjacent joint spaces are normal. Incidental finding of mild pes planus is noted. No other abnormalities are present.
Diagnosis: 
Kohler disease
Differential Diagnosis for these findings in this case: 
Kohler disease

Normal pattern of ossification in the navicular bone resulting in fragmented and sclerotic appearnce of navicular bone.
History (can include gestational age, or age in days, weeks, months):
5 year old female with abnormal gait
Discussion (include references): 
Kohler disease is osteochondrosis of the tarsal navicular bone occurring most commonly in children aged 2-9 years old and four times more frequently in boys.  Presenting symptoms generally include antalgic limp with weight bearing on the lateral border of the affected foot, pain and tenderness over the dorsomedial aspect of the midfoot, and sometimes swelling, redness, and warmth at the affected area.  Radiographic findings include anterior to posterior flattening of the navicular bone,  sclerosis, and fragmentation. The disease is self-limited; the navicular can reconstitute itself in four months to four years and is completely normal at skeletal maturity. Patients generally experience no residual disability or deformity.
The etiology of osteochondrosis is unknown, but it is hypothesized that the changes are due to avascular necrosis resulting from repetitive trauma at the developing center of ossification.  In the case of Kohler disease, the navicular is located at the apex of the arch of the foot and is therefore subjected to mechanical forces during weight bearing that may be sufficient to disrupt blood supply.
