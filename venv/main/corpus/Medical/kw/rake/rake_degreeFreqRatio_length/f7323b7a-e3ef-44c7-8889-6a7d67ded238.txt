No obvious deformity of the left arm.  Left elbow tenderness with minimal edema around the elbow.  No tenderness above or below left elbow joint.  Neurovascularly intact distally.
Closed reduction and splinting with a cast.

Follow-up images at 4 weeks demonstrated remodeling of the left humeral supracondyle with progression towards a more anterior position.
The lateral radiograph of the left elbow demonstrates mild posterior angulation of the capitellum as well as anterior displacement of the anterior fat pad and visualization of the posterior fat pad. 

The AP radiograph of the left elbow shows no medial or lateral displacement of the fractured supracondyle. 

Lateral radiograph of the uninjured right elbow is provided for comparison.
Supracondylar Fracture of the Humerus, type II
Supracondylar fracture of the humerus, type II
12 y-o old male presenting to the Emergency Department approximately 2 hours after a fall on his outstretched left hand.
The management of patients with a supracondylar fracture of the humerus has been a subject of controversy.  Cubitus varus (a decreased carrying angle of the extended elbow) and cubitus valgus (an increased carrying angle of the extended elbow) are deformities that can result from malreduction of the fractured elbow and failure to restore normal anatomy.  Type I fractures are non-displaced and require no reduction, and they are typically treated with casting alone.  Type III fractures nearly all require some form of internal fixation or percutaneous pinning in order to maintain reduction.  Type II fractures, however, pose a management quandary.  Reduction of the fracture is often difficult to maintain with external fixation (i.e. casting), which may require repeated manipulation in attempt to restore normal anatomy if there is a loss of reduction.  As a result, many physicians have recommended percutaneous pinning in type II fractures in order to maintain reduction.  A recent study of 25 patients found that 72% of type II supracondylar fractures that required initial reduction in the Emergency Department maintained reduction when treated with casting alone.  Of the 28% that lost reduction (7 patients), 5 underwent secondary percutaneous pinning.  The results showed that 23 of the 25 patients achieved a satisfactory outcome, leading the authors to suggest that closed reduction and casting can be performed in select patients with type II supracondylar fractures provided that there is close clinical and radiographic follow-up.
