Coordination: finger-nose-finger, finger tapping within normal limits with mild end-point tremor. Heel-shin normal.

Gait: deferred due to weakness

Labs unremarkable
Infliximab induction therapy and maintenance
MRI of the lumbar spine with and without contrast: 
Comparison: MRI lumbar spine dated 5/14/2015
 
Findings: There are 5 non-rib bearing lumbar type vertebral bodies.  The 
vertebral body heights and alignment are maintained. Disc desiccation is noted 
from L2 to S1, with partial disc height loss at L5-S1. Fatty degenerative 
endplate changes are again seen at L5-S1. The bone marrow signal is otherwise 
normal. No significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.
 
The conus medullaris terminates in a normal location at the level of L2. There 
is increased enhancement and thickening of the nerve roots of the cauda equina with increased meningeal enhancement about the conus medullaris.
 
Partially visualized sacroiliac joints are unremarkable.  Paraspinal soft 
tissues are unremarkable.
 
IMPRESSION:  
Interval worsening of diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement around the conus 
medullaris and cauda equina (thickened), compatible with progression of 
neurosarcoidosis.
Spinal leptomeningeal neurosarcoidosis of the conus medullaris
1. Neurosarcoidosis
2. Tuberculous meningitis
3. Leptomenigeal carcinomatosis
4. Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy
5. Lymphoma
54 yo LHD woman presents with progressively increasing weakness of her bilateral lower extremities L>R. Her neurologic symptoms began in 2009. She noticed that she was tripping and falling frequently, and it felt as if she was not lifting her legs up high enough. In March 2009, she had an MRI due to chronic lower back pain, at that time an intramedullary lesion at L1 and and extramedullary lesion at the conus medullaris were noted. 

Other symptoms included cough and shortness of breath. She was subsequently diagnosed with sarcoidosis by mediastinal lymph node biopsy in 2009. She was placed on oral prednisone for 7 months with minimal relief of symptoms. In 2011, she had a steroid infusion followed by methotrexate maintenance which she says helped her symptoms for several months. Her most recent infusion was in 2014, but she only had a 4 week improvement of symptoms.  

Over the past 2 months, the patient notes progressive weakness. Her left leg is more affected than her right leg. Pt began falling frequently and is no longer able to ambulate without assistance, she now uses a wheelchair. The patient also notes decreased sensation in both feet as well as decreased sensation in both lateral legs. The patient also has neuropathic pain in the legs for which she takes Neurontin. She reports occasional urge sensations in her bladder, but denies incontinence of bladder or bowel. At times she does experience urinary retention. Pt also endorses difficulty with writing, with her hands "more shaky" than usual over these past 2 months. She also has once weekly headaches, but denies any associated neurologic symptoms.
Neurologic complications of sarcoidosis occur in 5 to 10 percent of patients with sarcoidosis. It was helpful in this case that the patient previously carried this diagnosis. Any portion of the peripheral or central nervous system can be affected by sarcoidosis. It is important in patients who present with this to have a full evaluation to rule-out infectious or malignant causes. The gold standard for diagnosis of sarcoidosis is biopsy. Extraneural tissue biopsy is preferred if other organ systems are involved. Corticosteroids are the first line treatment in these patients, however other immunomodulating therapies may be considered as in this case.
