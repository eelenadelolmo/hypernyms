There is obvious deformity of the left elbow.  The patient is unable to flex or extend at the elbow, but is neurovascularly intact distally.
The elbow was relocated and the patient was placed in a long arm cast.  The patient was followed by Orthopedics.
The initial AP and lateral images of the left elbow demonstrate posterior dislocation at the elbow joint.  The post-reduction image although limited, demonstrates mild displacement of the medial epicondylar epiphysis consistent with an avulsion fracture.
