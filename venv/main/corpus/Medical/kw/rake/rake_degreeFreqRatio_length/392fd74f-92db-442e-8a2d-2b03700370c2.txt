Afebrile, VSS.

(+) left cheek/neck swelling.

Exam otherwise benign.
Observation and routine follow-up in pediatric and ENT clinics. Hemangioma is a clinical diagnosis given the appropriate age group and presentation.  Imaging is used primarily to rule out other rare causes (e.g. other types of tumors, vascular malformations).
Multiplanar, bilateral gray scale and limited Doppler ultrasound of the neck reveals a 3.1 x 2.3 cm heterogeneous, hypervascular, predominantly isoechoic mass in the left parotid gland.  Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging with and without contrast demonstrates a lobular mass centered in left parotid gland, with extension into the left infratemporal fossa and parapharyngeal space along the lateral border of the left internal jugular vein. There is additional insinuation of the mass between the left sternocleidomastoid muscle and levator scapularis muscle.  Contrast enhancement is intense and homogeneous, and there are numerous prominent flow voids within this mass.
Infantile hemangioma, Parotid
(1) Infantile hemangioma is the most common infant tumor and most common pediatric tumor of the parotid gland. 
(2) Malignant tumors (rhabdomyosarcoma, metastatic tumors, teratoma, primary parotid cancer, and lymphoproliferative disease), which account for 20% of parotid neoplasms, should be ruled out if necessary, especially in older children. (3) Benign tumors (Warthin tumor, adenomas, cystic hygroma/lymphangioma, Lipoblastoma, etc.) account for 80% of parotid neoplasms. 
(4) Inflammatory or infectious causes (cervical adenitis, abscess, tuberculosis, and sarcoidosis) are unlikely in a healthy two month old infant. 
(5) Miscellaneous rare causes (developmental cysts or fistulas, congenital fibromatosis of sternocleidomastoid, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva) are at the bottom of the differential.
The patient is a healthy 2 month old baby girl with a rapidly enlarging neck mass.  The mass was not noted on initial newborn exam at birth.  She was an appropriate for gestational age baby delivered via cesarean section at 37 weeks after failure to progress with induction, in a mother with preeclampsia.
