Lipase - 379
Multidisciplinary approach to method, necessity and timing of surgical drainage.  Indications include associated complications, concern for malignancy, or symptomatic pseudocyst.  

Drainage can be done either surgically, endoscopically, or percutaneously.
A large pseudocyst with thin walls and no enhancement is seen anterior to the left kidney.  Also noted is a smaller pseudocyst in the region of the pancreatic head. Incidentally noted inflammatory changes and ill-definition of the pancreatic head consistent with acute pancreatitis.
Pancreatic Pseudocyst
• Pancreatic Abscess
• Pancreatic Pseudoaneurysm
• Pancreatic Cancer
44yo male with known chronic pancreatitis presents with acute abdominal pain.
This patient's pancreas was atrophic (not pictured) due to chronic pancreatitis.  This scan was ordered after an acute episode of pancreatitis.
