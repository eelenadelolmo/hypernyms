Enlarged prostate.
Subsequent urinalyses with microhematuria.
Cystoscopic surgery with removal of lesions.
Unenhanced axial CT image of the bladder as part of a hematuria protocol shows a barely perceptible density extending intraluminally from the bladder base near the right ureteral orifice.
Delayed enhanced image of the bladder shows a 1.7cm X 1.8cm filling defect at the same location.  The prostate is symmetrically enlarged and indenting the bladder base.
There was no evidence of hydronephrosis (not shown).
Transitional Cell Carcinoma, confirmed by cytology.
Malignant bladder tumor (Transitional cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma)
Benign bladder tumor (leiomyoma, rhabdomyoma, hemangioma)
Infection, including TB
Ureterocele
Single episode of painless gross hematuria.
