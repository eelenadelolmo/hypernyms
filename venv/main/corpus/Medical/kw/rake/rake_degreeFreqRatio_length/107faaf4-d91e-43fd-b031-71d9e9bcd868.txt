Layngeal exam suggests possible impaired mobility of right true vocal cord and inability to see into right pyriform sinus due to edema. CT of the neck with contrast revealed bilateral diffuse thickening of the false and true vocal cords as well as aryepiglottic folds suspicious for inflammatory changes without neck adenopathy. CT of the chest was recommended for bilateral upper lobe lung masses suspicious for secondary lesions
The patient was referred to pulmonary medicine service. Her case was discussed in chest conference where there was agreement that her cancer was too advanced for surgical intervention.
CT of the chest with contrast revealed bilateral spiculated masses. The mass in the right upper lobe measures 1.8 cm X 1.7 cm and the left upper lobe mass measures 6.5 mm. There was diffuse emphysematous changes and parenchymal scaring in the posterior lower lobes. The liver and spleen were normal, and there were no lytic lesions.
Metastatic Squamous-Cell Lung Carcinoma
Bilateral spiculated lung masses suspicious for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma
HPI: 62-year old Caucasian, female G3P3 who presented with sore throat, otalgia, and odynophagia in 1999. Biopsy of her left tonsil revealed squamous cell carcinoma and MRI revealed a 4-cm tumor with level II lymph node, stage T3, N1, M0. She received radiation therapy and chemotherapy from April 1999 to June 1999.

In February 2005, she presented with 3 week history of worsening odynophagia and dyspagia for solids.
  
PMH: COPD, Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Cancer, pernicous anemia, alcohol dependence, nicotine dependence

PSH: Cholecystectomy in 1971, Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy in 1953. 

SH: 80 pack/year smoker.
This patient with a history of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma presents with new bilateral lung masses suspcious for stage 4 metastatic, squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Her lung cancer is nonresectable. Treatment options include comfort care and chemotherapy with platinum-based regimens to prolong survival.
