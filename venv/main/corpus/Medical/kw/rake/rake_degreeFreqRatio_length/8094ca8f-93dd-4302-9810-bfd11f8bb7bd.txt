Pt then underwent pre&#8208; operative tumor embolization with particle and coil embolization via the left ascending pharyngeal artery.

Thereafter, pt underwent a successful transcervical surgical resection of the vagal paraganglioma.

Pt had uneventful post-op course and was discharged home on post-op day 3. 

Pt has mild residual voice hoarseness due to vagal nerve encased within resected mass. Otherwise, pt is without complications from surgery. 

Pt is undergoing vocal therapy to maximize vocal cord recovery.
Angiogram: Pre&#8208;surgical Digital Subtraction Angiogram (DSA) reveals tumor splaying the internal and external carotids at the bifurcation. The tumor demonstrates a vascular “blush”.

CT: (Axial T2 weighted image with fat&#8208;saturation) Well defined enhancing mass at the level of the left carotid bifurcation. Splays the ICA and ECA with partial encasement.
Vagal Paraganglioma
Congenital: Branchial Cleft Cyst
Inflammatory: Reactive lymphadenopathy, Abscess
Neoplastic: Lymphoma, Salivary Gland Tumors, Neurogenic tumors, Paraganglioma
Vascular: Aneurysms of the carotid artery, Hematoma, Pseudoaneurysm
