Texto: 
BP 123/69, BMI 26
Abdomen: No organomegaly, masses, tenderness.  Non-distended, positive bowel sounds.
Back & Spine:  No costovertebral angle tenderness.  No point tenderness.
Extremities: no edema
Neuro:  A&O x3, no focal neurological deficits.  
The rest of her exam was non-contributory, including a normal UA.
There is no specific treatment to delay or prevent the progression of the disease.  Symptomatic treatment of pain is warranted but nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are discouraged due to risk of exacerbation of renal failure  Also, tight blood pressure control is needed and should be monitored to track renal failure progression.  Many deaths from ADPKD are the result of ASCVD.  In addition, lots of fluids are encouraged, while caffeine should be avoided, to suppress antidiuretic hormone secretion and prevent stone formation (5).

Follow up: 
•Genetic counseling with possibility of testing of family members
•Symptomatic treatment and watching renal function
•Ultrasound of kidneys for baseline and anatomy
MRI showed multiple renal cysts.  The largest measures 4.7 cm in maximal dimension and is in the upper pole of the right kidney.  Additional smaller cysts are present in both kidneys, with approximately 4 moderate sized ones in the right kidney and 4 moderate sized ones in the left kidneys.
Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)
ADPKD (autosomal dominant)
Tuberous Sclerosis (may also have renal angiomyolipoma)
von Hippel-Lindau (may have CNS hemangioblastoma)
Other cystic disease of the kidney:
Acquired renal cystic disease, ARPKD (autosomal recessive), medullary cystic disease, simple renal cysts.  ARPKD can be differentiated from ADPKD by the hepatic fibrosis that is always present in patients with ARPKD.
Patient had chronic lower back/hip pain for four years that got worse 2 weeks prior to admission.  The pain is reproducible with lifting, walking, standing over half an hour and sitting too long.
She was seen by orthopedics who think the back pain is musculoskeletal, however, she still needs interval renal function tests and monitoring.  The fact that she has this many cysts at such a young age is a bad prognostic sign.  Also, she will need counseling on the genetics of her disease.
