Vital Signs: HR 80    BP 128/62   RR 12
General: The patient is an alert male in no acute distress, with some discomfort
Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 present, no murmur
Pulmonary: All lung fields clear to auscultation and breath sounds equal bilaterally
Musculoskeletal: Left wrist casted, no gross deformity or swelling seen on fingers. Grip strength 70lb with right hand, unable to test on left due to cast. Pinch strength 9lb with right hand, 1lb with left hand. ROM normal in right wrist , unable to test on left due to cast. Left shoulder exam revealed positive Neer’s test for impingement and positive Hawkins test. Cervical compression produced left sided neck pain.
Neuro: Sensation intact and equal in all five fingers bilaterally, Bicep and tricep DTR’s 2+ bilaterally
As noted above, the patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation with bone graft and screw placement in the displaced fracture, as well as debridement of the avascular necrosis and scapholunate ligament and removal of the intra-articular loose body. 

The patient was placed in a short arm thumb spica cast with follow up in two weeks to evaluate the healing progress of the repaired fracture.
Figure1. AP view X-ray of left wrist. A displaced scaphoid waist fracture with 2.6mm fracture gap is present. Sclerotic changes at the proximal pole of the scaphoid may represent avascular necrosis.

Figure2. Oblique view X-ray of left wrist. A minimally displaced scaphoid fracture is noted. There are scelortic changes of the proximal pole of the scaphoid that may represent avascular necrosis. The radius and ulna are relatively normally aligned. The carpal bones demonstrate reactive bone at the scapholunate joint which may represent ligamentous injury or post-traumatic arthrosis.

Figure3. Lateral view X-ray of left wrist. A minimally displaced scaphoid fracture is noted. The alignment of the radius and ulna appear normal. There may be sclerotic changes of the proximal pole of the scaphoid but this is difficult to discern in this view.

Figure4. PA view X-ray with ulnar deviation. A displaced scaphoid fracture is noted. There is increased displacement in the fracture due to ulnar stress compared to neutral X-rays. The alignment of the radius and ulna appear normal.

Figure5. Axial cut CT of left wrist. A displaced scaphoid fracture is seen with notable sclerotic changes in the proximal pole of the scaphoid most likely demonstrating avascular necrosis.

Figure6. Axial cut CT of left wrist. A displaced scaphoid fracture is seen with notable sclerotic changes in the proximal pole most likely demonstrating avascular necrosis.

Figure7. Coronal cut CT of left wrist. A scaphoid waist fracture with about 2.5mm displacement is seen with sclerotic changes of the proximal pole of the scaphoid. No appreciable increase in distance is noted between the scaphoid and lunate. This suggests that the scapholunate ligament is intact but does not rule out a tear.

The differential for the history and physical exam findings noted are a scaphoid fracture, a wrist sprain, a fracture of a different carpal bone, or a ligamentous injury.

When these are combined with the imaging findings, the differential in addition to a displaced scaphoid fracture includes a fracture with or without avascular necrosis and a fracture with or without a scapholunate ligamentous disruption.
The patient is a 19 y.o. man who was a pedestrian involved in a motor vehicle accident in July 201X. The patient was riding a bicycle when a car struck him on his left side, hitting his ankle and knee, and throwing him onto the ground. He fell onto his outstretched left hand and had no loss of consciousness. He was taken by ambulance to ECMC. At the time immediately following the accident, the patient complained of left sided pain including his shoulder, wrist, and ankle. He also reported pain in his neck. He had radiographs taken at ECMC and after evaluation was discharged home with a prescription for ibuprofen. In the days following the injury the patient continued to have pain with the primary site being the radial side of his left wrist. He reported pain with gripping, extending the wrist, and lifting objects. He denied any numbness or tingling. The patient began treatment for his back and neck pain and was referred to an orthopedic specialist where radiographs were performed. The patient was diagnosed with a scaphoid fracture according to radiographic findings and a short arm cast was placed on 8/26/16.

Following evaluation with imaging, the patient was referred to an orthopedic surgeon and underwent wrist surgery on 10/3/1X. He was found to have nonunion of the scaphoid fracture at this time with avascular necrosis of the proximal pole of the scaphoid. Additionally, a scapholunate ligament tear was noted and an intra-articular loose body was found and removed in the area as well. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation with an autologous bone graft from the distal radius. A screw was placed to fixate the proximal to distal pole of the scaphoid. In the weeks following the procedure, the patient states that his wrist pain has been improving but is still present. He reports a constant aching and stiffness in the wrist and pain with extension of the fingers and thumb. 

The patient is a full time student and is not currently employed. He denies alcohol, tobacco or illicit drug use. He has seasonal allergies and no known drug allergies. He currently takes no other medication than ibuprofen for pain.

Past medical Hx: asthma as a child, left ankle fracture with surgical repair 2 years ago.

This patient had a rather typical presentation of a scaphoid fracture. Scaphoid fractures often occur from falling on an outstretched hand. This happens by hyperextension of the wrist with compression of the radial side of the hand. Additionally, scaphoid fractures are most common in young adult men. This patient fits all of these criteria. He reported that he fell on an outstretched hand when he was struck by a vehicle while riding his bike. He also fits the description of a young adult male in whom these fractures are common. What is interesting about this patient is that because of the mechanism of his injury, he had pain in multiple parts of his body following the accident which were all being evaluated and treated. After initial examination radiographs of the left wrist were immediately ordered.  The scaphoid fracture was identified and images were reviewed with the patient as well as possible sequelae.  The importance of such was impressed upon the patient that it was necessary that he be referred to the orthopedic surgeon for attention immediately due to the possibility of avascular necrosis.  
In many cases, scaphoid fractures remain undiagnosed shortly after an injury which can be detrimental to the healing process of the patient’s wrist. This patient is a classic example of this. His injury occurred in July and he did not present to the chiropractor for evaluation until August afterwhich imaging was recommended.   By this time, the fracture was very obvious on radiographic films because of the displacement of the fracture and the beginning signs of avascular necrosis of the scaphoid. As stated above, the treatment for displaced fractures is always surgery to prevent nonunion of the bone. In this case though, the question arises if this patient would have needed surgery to begin with if his fracture had been diagnosed sooner following his injury. If the fracture had not been displaced originally, the use of a short arm thumb spica cast to the affected wrist immediately after the injury may have prevented movement of the bone. This could have not only prevented the need for surgical intervention, it also could have prevented the increased risk of chronic wrist pain following avascular necrosis and delayed union of the fracture. 
However, despite all of this, it is interesting to note that this patient additionally had a grade two tear of the scapholunate ligament discovered during surgery. On radiographs, no increased space was visualized between the scaphoid and lunate, which is the diagnostic criteria on imaging studies for a scapholunate ligamentous tear. Had this patient never undergone surgical intervention, the scapholunate tear may have never been diagnosed. Undiagnosed and unrepaired disruptions in the scapholunate ligament can lead to disruption of the entire proximal carpal row which can ultimately lead to a condition termed SLAC (scapholunate advanced collapse). SLAC is a pattern of degenerative change in the wrist which is caused by poor articulation and alignment between the scaphoid, lunate, and radius. This in itself can also be a cause of chronic wrist pain in poorly treated scaphoid injuries. 
It is clear that this was a rather complicated case considering the size of the bone fractured. Ultimately, the patient did require surgical treatment and this treatment may prevent him from getting some of the late sequelae often seen in inadequately healed or inadequately treated scaphoid fractures. This case highlights the importance of correctly identifying and treating a scaphoid fracture following an injury. Although the scaphoid seems like a small and insignificant bone, poor healing can lead to much larger consequences than may be immediately obvious.
