Unremarkable abdominal exam.

Incidentally found on CT are two well-defined cysts with thin calcified rim in the posterior right hepatic lobe.  Serpentine calcifications are noted within the matrix of one of the cysts.
Echinococcal cyst (hydatid disease) of the liver
Metastatic Carcinoma
Hepatic cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma
Primary Hepatic Tumor
Echinococcal Cyst
Liver Abscess
Injured in motor vehicle accident with comminuted tibial plateau fracture.  Abdomen/pelvis CT imaging included in trauma work-up.
The patient's CT findings were consistent with Type V cysts due to the presence of calcifications.  In turn, no treatment was indicated because these cysts are considered inactive.
