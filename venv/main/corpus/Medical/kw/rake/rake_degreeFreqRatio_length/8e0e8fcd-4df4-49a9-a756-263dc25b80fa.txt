General:  appears older than stated age and chronically ill.
Abdomen: normal bowel sounds with a lobulated mass in the left upper quadrant.
Neurologic: CN II- XII intact.  Alert and oriented x 3.
Prognosis  and  Treatment: Multimodality treatment of peritoneal mesothelioma has become more common in recent years, since surgery alone and/or intraperitoneal chemotherapy alone have proven to be similarly ineffective. Debulking surgery involves the removal of all or nearly all visible tumor, andmay be combined with intraperitoneal chemotherapy and/or radiation.
On CT imaging the mass was encasing the spleen circumstantially. The mass also encased the perisplenic vessels and splenic hilar vessels. IR was consulted and a CT guided biopsy yielded atypical mesothelioma cells.  PET examination showed hypermetabolic activity in the perisplenic mass as well as within portal nodes and internal mammary nodes.
