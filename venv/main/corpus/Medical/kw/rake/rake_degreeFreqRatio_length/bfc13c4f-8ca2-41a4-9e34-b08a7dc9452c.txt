Labs and visual field testing: Pending
Surgical resection.
Radiological Findings: 
-Large sellar mass with suprasellar extension.
-Isointense on T1, hyperintense T2, enhances intensely and heterogeneously
-Intrasellar expansion (ballooning of sella)
-Cavernous sinus involvement, no ICA involvement
Pituitary Macroadenoma
1.  Pituitary Macroadenoma
2.  Craniopharyngioma (Ca2+, mural nodule, fluid/fluid level, cystic regions)
3.  Rathke's cleft cyst (no enhancement)
4.  Meningioma (should be able to define pituitary)
50 y/o male with decreased libido.
No discrete pituitary gland is identified making a pituitary based lesion very likely.  The size being >1cm makes this a macroadenoma.  Mass effect usually make these lesions symptomatic.  These include hypopituitarism, visual symptoms from optic chiasm displacement (bitemporal hemianopsia is classic), other cranial nerve palsy (cavernous location of CNs III, IV, V-1, VI).  Macroadenomas can secrete hormonal subunits but are uncommonly functional (unlike microadenomas).

*Calcification in macroadenomas is uncommon (common in craniopharyngioma). Cystic regions, +/- fluid/fluid levels, mural nodule also seen in craniopharyngioma.
*Should be able to define pituitary gland in intrasellar extension of meningioma.
*Rathke's cleft cyst-doesn't enhance.
