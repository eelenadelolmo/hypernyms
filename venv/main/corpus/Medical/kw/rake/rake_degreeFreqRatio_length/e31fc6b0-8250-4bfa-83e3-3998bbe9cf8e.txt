Texto: 
approximately 1.5 cm mobile breast mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast
Ultrasound image from a focused examination shows a well-defined oval lesion with a relatively hypoechoic margin, but predominantly isoechoic within - relative to the surrounding normal breast parenchyma, with a focus of eccentric calcification.  Its long axis is parallel to the chest wall, a benign characteristic.
