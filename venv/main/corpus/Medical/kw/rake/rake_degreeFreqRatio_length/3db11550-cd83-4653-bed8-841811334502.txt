Texto: 
The patient at the time of physical examination had a regular rate and rythym and a normal auscultation examination. 

Tests:
Prior stress test: negative 
Initial ECG: 
sinus rhythm 
incomplete right bundle branch block
borderline low voltage
T-wave inversion in the inferior and anterolateral leads
CXR: mild enlargement cardiac silhouette
Troponin: negative
Echo: 
Mild left ventricular hypertrophy 
Mild apical hypokinesis EF 40%
Cardiac SPECT: 
Apical-lateral scar with associated hypokinesis
No reversible perfusion defect
PCI
Normal coronary arteries.
Apical aneurysm.
Ejection fraction of 40%
Medical management
Abnormally thin myocardium of  the inferior and lateral walls of the left ventricle associated with and enlarged network of trabeculae carne and deep endothelial recesses
Isolated Left Ventricular Noncompaction
• Idiopathic cardiomyopathy
• Ventricular aneurysm
• Noncompaction
67-year-old woman presents with hypertension and recurrent idiopathic ventricular tachycardia.

Her past medical history is significant for cardiac arrest and subsequent implanted pacer-cardioverter-defibrillator
In this case the diagnosis of isolated left ventricular non-compaction was made by CT despite being missed by invasive angiography, echocardiography, and SPECT imaging.
