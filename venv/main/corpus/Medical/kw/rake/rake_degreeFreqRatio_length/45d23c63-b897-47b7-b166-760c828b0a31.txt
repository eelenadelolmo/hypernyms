Heart murmur on exam.  normal development.  Clear lungs bilaterally,
Large aberrant right pulmonary vessel whose insertion is uncertain.  In addition to this, cardiomegaly is present with a small right lung and bilaterally enlarged pulmonary arteries.
Scimitar Syndrome
Hypoplasia of right lung with aplasia of right pulmonary artery with increased systemic arterial supply

Horseshoe lung
10-year-old girl presenting for follow-up for a “heart murmur” noted at birth.  Patient has no complaints and has developed normally without physical limitations.
See factoid

The large pulmonary arteries and cardiomegaly are not typically seen with is syndrome and raised the question of a cardiac defect, as the chest film demonstrated shunt vascularity.  At pulmonary angiography, it was demonstrated the entire right lung drained in to the scimitar vein and emptied at the junction of the IVC and right atrium.  In addition, an ASD was present.  So, for all practical purposes, our patient had two left-to-right shunts.
