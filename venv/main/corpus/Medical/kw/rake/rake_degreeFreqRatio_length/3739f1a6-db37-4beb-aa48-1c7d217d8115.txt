Prior wrist x-ray report of possible chondrocalcinosis.
None required.
Interval resolution of fluffy calcifications distal to the radial styloid.
Hydroxyapatite Crystal Deposition Disease - Wrist
Surgical removal of ossification
Resolved avulsion fracture
Chondrocalcinosis
47 year-old woman with chronic wrist pain.
While HADD is a commonly abnormality, the location in this case (distal to the radial styloid) is unusual. Just as in the shoulder, the interval resolution of fluffy ossification after an interval of weeks or months is characteristic of HADD.
