	Barter syndrome
Drugs:	Furosemide in infants
	Prolonged ACTH therapy
	Excess vitamin E, D or calcium
	Nephrotoxic drugs such as amphotericin B
Miscellaneous
	Sarcoidosis
	Idiopathic hypercalciuria or hypercalcemia
35 year old white male with flank pain. Patient has history of frequent stone passage, sometimes as frequently as every other day
