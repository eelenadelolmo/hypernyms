Vascular surgery was immediately contacted and the patient underwent an immediate successful endovascular AAA repair. No postprocedural complications. Patient is currently stable and followed on the wards.
The right lateral wall of the infrarenal abdominal aortic aneursym is ruptured with extravasation of blood, (density of the material is isodense to the contents of the aortic lumen) from the aorta into the right retroperitoneum, predominantly in the right anterior pararenal space.

AAA with acute rupture
AAA with chronic rupture
Retroperitoneal fibrosis
