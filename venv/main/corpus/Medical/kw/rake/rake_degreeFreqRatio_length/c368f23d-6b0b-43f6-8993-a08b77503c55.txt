Right flank tenderness
Vascular surgery was immediately contacted and the patient underwent an immediate successful endovascular AAA repair. No postprocedural complications. Patient is currently stable and followed on the wards.
The right lateral wall of the infrarenal abdominal aortic aneursym is ruptured with extravasation of blood, (density of the material is isodense to the contents of the aortic lumen) from the aorta into the right retroperitoneum, predominantly in the right anterior pararenal space.
Ruptured Infrarenal Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm
AAA with acute rupture
AAA with chronic rupture
Retroperitoneal fibrosis
Retroperioneal infiltrating neoplasm
Seventy-five year-old man with right sided flank pain radiating into his right groin that started suddenly about 1 hr ago.
The study was performed without IV or enteric contrast, since the clinical concern was to exclude renal stones.
