Multiple lumps near the articulations involving the knees, wrists, and shoulders.
Routine follow up unless they become symptomatic or continue to grow past skeletal maturity, or start to grow again after a period of quiescence, which may indicate malignant transformation and warrant additional evaluation leading to surgical intervention.
Multiple bony outgrowths with sessile or partially pedunculated morphology. On MRI these lesions follow normal marrow signal, indicating they have a fatty content similar to bone marrow.
Multiple Hereditary Exostoses
Enchondroma
Multiple Osteochondromas
Ollier's disease
Maffucci syndrome
Fibrous Dysplasia
Eosinophilic Granuloma
8 year old with multiple joint lumps.
Diaphyseal aclasis (hereditary exostoses or osteochondromatosis). Autosomal dominant transmission. Presents as multiple palpable masses near joint articulations on physical exam. Multiple osteochondromas that enlarge and  grow until skeletal maturity. These lesions virtually always involve the knees. 20% of these lesions may undergo malignant transformation and  likely involve the axial portions of the skeleton.
