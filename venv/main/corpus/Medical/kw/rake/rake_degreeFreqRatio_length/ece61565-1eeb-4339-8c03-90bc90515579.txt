Leukoaraiosis is by definition a characteristic radiologic finding that is sometimes synonymous with cerebral small vessel disease, and is a diagnosis of exclusion. As the symptoms did not fully recover in 24 hours, a TIA is ruled out. As there are no other findings of pathology, Leukoaraiosis is the most likely diagnosis.The patient's care was transferred to a Medicare-approved Physical Rehabilitation Unit where she is scheduled to continue PT, OT, and Speech Therapy for at least 3 hours a day during the week for the next 6 weeks. While she is trated at this facility, her PCM becomes the physician working there. Care will be transferred back once she completes her rehabillitation and is discharged home. The patient will schedule a follow-up appointment upon discharge.
• MRI Brain:
"There is mild, age-appropriate volume loss. There is periventricular and deep white matter symmetric signal abnormality. There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass, or mass effect. The brain parenchyma, CSF-containing spaces, posterior fossa, limited views of the internal auditory canals and orbits, overlying skull, and soft tissues are unremarkable."

• MRA Head w/o contrast:
"The circle of Willis is intact. There is no evidence of aneurysm. There is no evidence of vessel occlusion."

• Transient Ischemic Attack

69 y/o woman with hypertension presents to inpatient service with "left-sided weakness." Yesterday morning she noted that she began dragging her left side. A few hours later the weakness was more obvious and involved her left hand. She had a CT scan that was nonspecifically abnormal because of "cerebral atrophy", but no stroke was seen. She was admitted with a provisional diagnosis of stroke vs. transient ischemic attack. 

Her right side was not involved. There was no visual loss. There was no facial weakness. She noted that left sided sensations were diminished as compared to the right. She denied a history of strokes.

Since that time, she has regained strength in her left leg, however today she noticed a slight slurring of her speech and was unable to lift her arm off the bed.

In this case, physical rehabilitation plays an important role in the care of the patient. Under the 75/25 rule, 75% of patient's discharged from a Medicare-approved physical rehabilitation unit must meet a certain diagnosis, and 'stroke' is one of them. She does not qualify for a skilled nursing facility, although she is not ready to resume her ADLs and IADLs at this time, which makes a rehabilitation unit an attractive choice. What is important to realize is that her PCM will change to the physicians at the rehabilitation unit while she is there, and thus her Tricare-appointed physician will need to keep in touch with that person in order to stay updated about her health. The physician should also realize that vascular dementia is much more likely in patient's with Leukoaraiosis.
