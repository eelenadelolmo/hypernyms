Dermoid cysts rarely undergo malignant degeneration (0.17-2%), however complete surgical removal via laparotomy or laparoscopy is the treatment of choice secondary to the risk of torsion and/or rupture.  Histopathologic evaluation of the specimen should follow removal; if immature elements are found in the specimen, then standard staging should be performed.
Pelvic ultrasound – 2.6 x 2.3 x 2.3 cm hyperechoic right ovarian lesion.
CT, abdomen/pelvis w/ IV contrast – 2.1 x 2.5 cm mass in right ovary containing fat attenuation, most consistent with a dermoid cyst.

40 yo AD female with an asymptomatic right ovarian mass identified during a pelvic ultrasound for uterine fibroids.
Dermoid cysts, also called benign cystic teratomas, are the most common benign ovarian tumors.  These cysts are neoplastic tumors derived from germ cells and contain differentiated tissue from the three germ cell layers: ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm.  Most commonly found are endodermal elements such as skin, sweat and sebaceous glands, hair, and sebum.  Teeth, bone, fat, and endocrine tissue may also be found in these cysts.

Dermoid cysts are oftentimes identified incidentally on routine pelvic exam.  Cysts are usually asymptomatic, unilateral, nontender, and mobile.  Pelvic ultrasound is the initial modality used to evaluate the mass.  Imaging most commonly reveals a complex, predominantly solid mass with echogenic internal components (i.e. bone, fat), but may also vary from completely cystic to completely solid depending on the contents of the cyst.  Cysts containing large amounts of fat are associated with hypoechoic distal shadowing as was seen in this patient.  Pelvic computed tomography is a helpful adjunct to assist in identifying the cyst contents.
