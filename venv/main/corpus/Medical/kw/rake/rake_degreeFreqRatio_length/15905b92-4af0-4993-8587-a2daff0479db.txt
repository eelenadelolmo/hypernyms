Findings include a fluid density on CT within the right upper quadrant adjacent to the liver.  Loculations and septations may be present as well. An adjacent hepatic parenchymal defect is often present. As they mature, bilomas usually appear round with a thin surrounding capsule.  Free intra-peritoneal fluid collections can indicate biloma rupture. 

Only biliary scintigraphy, can definitively demonstrate a communication between the biliary tree and the biloma contents.
Hepatic laceration with biloma.
Biloma, hematoma, seroma, abscess
