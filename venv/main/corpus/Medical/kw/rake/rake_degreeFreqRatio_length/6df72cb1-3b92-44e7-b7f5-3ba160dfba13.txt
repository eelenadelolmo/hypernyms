• CT demonstrates a large heterogeneous mass in the superior anterior mediastinum causing deviation of the trachea to the right.  The proximal portion of the major branches from the aortic arch are slightly narrowed due to this mass, especially at the left common carotid artery.  An enlarged lymph node is seen in the right hilum as well as two pulmonary nodules in the right upper lobe.
