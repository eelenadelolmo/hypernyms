5.0 mm contiguous axial CT images of the chest demonstrated normal parenchyma without nodule, effusion or infiltrate.  Mild interstitial disease, left basilar fibronodular scarring and mild hyperinflation.  No mediastinal, hilar or axillary adenopathy.  Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.  Coronary artery calcifications.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
	Incidental finding of aberrant vessel seen lateral to the aortic arch on the left.  Following the vessel through many cuts demonstrated that the vessel was a left upper lobe pulmonary vein which drained into the left brachiocephalic.  There was no other venous abnormalities seen.
