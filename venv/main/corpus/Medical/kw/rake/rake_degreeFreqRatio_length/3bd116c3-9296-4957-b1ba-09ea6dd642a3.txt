Decreased level of consciousness without focal neurologic deficit.
Patient was treated with IV fluids and heparin to no avail.  Patient died within 24 ours of the MRI and MRV.
CT and Flair images reveal clot in the superior saggital sinus.

Superior Saggital Sinus Thrombosis and right transverse sinus thrombosis secondary dehydration
saggital sinus thrombosis
Severe increase in intracranial pressure
Brain death
Long history of inflammatory bowel disease.  Patient presents with dehydration, N/V and severe headache and stupor.
Saggital sinus thrombosis has been associated with over 100 different conditions including pregnancy, dehydration, trauma, and birth control pills.  

MRV is the most accurate non-invasive diagnositic tool although the diagnosis can be suspected based on unenhanced CT and MRI.  Cathater studies are not indicated unless thrombolysis is a theraputic consideration
