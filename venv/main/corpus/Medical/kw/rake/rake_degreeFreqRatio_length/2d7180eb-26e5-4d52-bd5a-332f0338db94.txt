36.4, HR 101, BP 102/77, RR 18, 96% sat[R.A.]

Abdomen soft, mildly distended and non-tender, no guarding or rebound.  The remainder of the examination was normal.  

CBC normal(WBC 8.3), BUN 91, creatinine 2.78, LFTs normal.  Remainder of electrolytes normal.
Postoperative course was significant for marked improvement in abdominal pain with return of appetite.  Patient was discharged on post-operative day 5.
Markedly distended loops of small bowel with two transition points, highly suggestive of closed-loop bowel obstruction.  Air within jejunal wall(pneumatosis intestinalis), as well as air within mesenteric vasculature and several small foci of air within liver especially concerning for intestinal ischemia.  No findings of pneumoperitoneum.

Incidentally discovered large, fluid attenuating renal cysts, the largest measuring 10.0 x 7.4 cm.  However, no evidence of rupture or acute process.
Pneumatosis intestinalis secondary to closed-loop bowel obstruction
• Small bowel obstruction (adhesions, hernia, neoplasm)
• Midgut volvulus
69 y.o. man with a 4 day history of progressive abdominal pain and bloating, with associated nausea/vomiting and decreased appetite.  Patient denies bowel movement during previous 4 days, but continues to pass flatus.  The patient has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, GERD and has no history of GI complaints.  No surgical history.  Last colonoscopy was 5 years ago, at which time was normal.
