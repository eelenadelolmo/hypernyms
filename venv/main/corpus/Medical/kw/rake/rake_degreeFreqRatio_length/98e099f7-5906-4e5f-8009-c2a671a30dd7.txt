75 year old male with right lower quadrant pain.  On further discussion with the referring provider, the pain is located most intensely in the right inguinal canal.  The patient has had similar pain, on and off, over the past year.
Please note that in the literature, an Amyand's hernia may refer to the original case, i.e.  perforated appendix within the inguinal canal, unperforated appendicitis within the inguinal canal, or simply the appendix within the inguinal canal (as in this case).
