Patient is status post left mastectomy.   Laboratory values were remarkable for a fibrinogen of 611 (nl 182-410), ferritin 220 (nl 15-150), and CA 27-29 728 (nl 0-37).
There is an abnormal reticulonodular interstitial pattern.  There is asymmetry of the left breast shadow and axillary surgical clips indicative of prior surgical teatment of left breast cancer.  The right pleural drain and extra-thoracic air are from a recent diagnostic open lung biopsy.
