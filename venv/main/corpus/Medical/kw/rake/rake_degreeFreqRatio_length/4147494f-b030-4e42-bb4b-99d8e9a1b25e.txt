Texto: 
Expansile lytic lesion is seen involving the distal half of the
shaft of the left third metacarpal bone.  Similar process is almost involving the entire shaft of the proximal phalanx of the left third finger, middle phalanx of the left third finger, and distal half of the middle phalanx of the left fourth finger.  Findings are consistent with multiple enchondroma.
