PHYSICAL EXAM:On physical exam she was a well developed, well nourished woman with an 8mm erythematous-to-violaceous round plaque on her inferior left ear lobe. Remainder of the physical was unremarkable and she had no lymphadenopathy. No other similar lesions were noted on full skin exam. The plaque was biopsied for evaluation.
HISTOPATHOLOGY: Sections revealed a nodular lymphocytic growth pattern with positivity for BCL-2 and CD20. A mixture of small cleaved cells with some large cells were present.
A repeat biopsy for fresh tissue was performed on the same site and sent for flow cytometry which showed elevated HLA-DR, and a small population of cells that were CD19 and CD20 positive and which co-expressed CD10.
She was referred to Hematology/Oncology for further evaluation. They performed a bone marrow biopsy and ordered CT scans, ESR, CBC, and electrolyte panels. All of these tests were negative or normal. They referred her to radiation oncology.
