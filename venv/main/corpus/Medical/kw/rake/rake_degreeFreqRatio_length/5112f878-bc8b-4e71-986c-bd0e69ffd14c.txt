Physical exam stable from previous visits. No tenderness to palpation within the examined musculoskeletal system.

Laboratory - 

PSA from May 7 - 603.

PSA from June 13 - 4622.
While giving results of the study to physician, he relays that the patient will undergo chemotherapy for his disease.  The patient reports no bone pain presently, but it is likely that at some point during his chemotherapy he will experience some pain.  Accordingly, Samarium-153 therapy is indicated in the treatment of this patient if bony pain were to occur, given the bone scan activity of the metastatic lesions.  Disease progression/remission can be monitored with further bone scans.  Plain films are recommended for evaluation of the large joints and spine if to evaluate for pathologic fractures, and weight bearing joints should be evaluated for possible XRT.
Rapid interval progression of the patient's metastatic prostate cancer.
Metastatic Prostate Cancer
Metastatic prostate cancer (given known history)
Other metastatic neoplasm (Renal, lung, breast, etc.)
Patient with known prostate cancer with rise in PSA from 600 to 4600 in one month's time.  Patient non-symptomatic.
See treatment and followup.
