24 YO Hispanic woman G2 P1001 present for OB ultrasound to review anatomy and to verify dates.
This was a typical case and expected outcome.  The diagnosis of a nuchal cord puts all radiologists on at an ethical dilemna -- to report and potentially impose an unnecessay burden on both the OB/GYN physician and the patient or not to report and risk a potentially preventable death or lawsuit.
