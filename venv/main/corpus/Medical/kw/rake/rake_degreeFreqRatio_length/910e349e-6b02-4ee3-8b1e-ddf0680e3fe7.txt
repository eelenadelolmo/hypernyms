Texto: 
Patient is acutely tender to palpation along the mid to distal Achilles tendon.  Ability to plantar and dorsiflex is noted.
Conservative therapy including rest and icing.
There is no fracture, subluxation or dislocation.  An os peroneum is noted, which is a normal accessory ossicle.  Visualized soft tissues are remarkable for thickening of the mid to distal Achilles tendon, most
prominent approximately 3.5 cm from the calcaneus with abnormal soft tissue density within adjacent fat suggestive of hematoma.
Achilles Tendon Tear (Partial)
Achilles Tendon Tear (Partial)
Achilles Tendon Tear (Complete)
28 year-old male, reports sudden pain while twisting during basketball.  Noncontact injury.  Felt pop.
Exam is generally sufficient for diagnosis, but plain films were revealing in this case.  MRI and US were offered but declined by the Ortho service prior to decision for conservative management.
