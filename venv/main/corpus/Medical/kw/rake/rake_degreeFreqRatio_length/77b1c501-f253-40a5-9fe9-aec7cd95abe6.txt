Biliary diversion and stenting.
Ultrasound

Trace perihepatic fluid and fluid in the gallbladder fossa not unexpected for postoperative patient.
No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Normal portal and hepatic flow. 

CT

Ascites and free pelvic fluid with mild stranding within the mesentery.

Scintigraphic

No gallbladder was visualized consistent with the patient's prior cholecystectomy.
 
10 minutes following radiotracer injection, an abnormal blush of radiotracer was demonstrated in the region of the gallbladder fossa and along the left paracolic gutter.
Coalescence of additional abnormal radiotracer activity within the pelvis persisted on delayed upright images of the abdomen and pelvis.
Biliary leak, status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy
Post laparoscopic cholecystectomy biliary leak.
5 days post op from laparoscopic cholecystectomy now with complaint of  general abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.  Has not passed stool or gas.
Laparascopic Cholecystecomy.
 
Major complications (2.6%)
   Bleeding, infection, bile leak, duct injury, bowel injury

Common asymptomatic postoperative (24hrs) perihepatic fluid collections on US. (50%)
  Major leaks usually 2-10 days postop.
  Fever, abdominal pain, bilious ascites
  Elevated WBC, AP, GGT, T bili
