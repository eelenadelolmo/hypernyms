Embolization was attempted,
but the lesion could not be completely embolized without sacrifice of the main arterial supply to the kidney.  Pt proceeded to nephrectomy
large cirsoid AVM located within the right kidney.
Vessels demonstrate classic corckscrew apperance.  
The draining vein is aneurymally dialated with mass effect on surrounding kidney.
Anatomic anomally of an accessory renal artery.  Both the superior and inferior renal arteries feed the AVM.  
Selective angiography of the inferior artery branches shows that there is arterial supply to the AVM from both.
RENAL ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATION
Cirsoid AVM (Imaging diagnostic)
Incidental finding of renal mass on virtual colonoscopy
Embolization was attempted using Onyx material.  Flow dynamics in this lesion  were much less favorable than in neural avms where Onyx is typically used.  Difficulties were encountered in trying to 'flow' the embolization material into the AVM.  Eventually, the microcateter tip became embeded in the embolization material and the microcatheter broke off leaving an ~ 15 cm length attached within the kidney. The detatched portion of the catheter was recovered during the nephrectomy.
