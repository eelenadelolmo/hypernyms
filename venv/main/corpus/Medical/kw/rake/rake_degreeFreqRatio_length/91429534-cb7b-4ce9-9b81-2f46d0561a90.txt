Treatment
 -Chemotherapy
 -Radiation therapy
Survival rate 50% at 5 yrs.
Complications
 -Intracranial extension.
CT

-Asymmetric fullness of left lateral soft tissues of the nasopharynx at the level of the ptyergoid plates.
-Mass lesion along course of the eustachian tube and into left TMJ with central hypoattenuation and rim enhancement post contrast.
-Soft tissue density in left middle ear and mastoid air cells.
-Osseous erosion of left mastoid air cells.

MR
-High T2 signal abnormality in the left postero-lateral nasopharynx with a well-circumscribed focus measuring approximately 1.8cm. 
-Extension along the approximate course of eustachian tube both laterally and superiorly with divergence at approximately the epitympanum superiorly into the temporal bone and laterally through the mastoid air cells.  
-High T2 signal abnormality within the posterior auricular subcutaneous soft tissues.  
-Invasion of the signal abnormalities through the temporal bones and into the posterolateral, middle cranial fossa with left temporal lobe involvement.
EMBRYONAL RHABDOMYOSARCOMA
 -Botryoid type.
Differential-Aggressive pediatric nasopharyngeal mass
Infection
Neoplasm
 -Rhabdomyosarcoma
Concern for possible abscess of middle ear.
The patient was originally thought to have a middle ear infection and treated repeatedly with b-lactam and fluuroquinolone antibiotics.  On the day of admission the CT scan was thought to demonstrate and aggressive infection of the middle ear but neoplastic mass was not ruled out.  A biopsy was performed demonstrating botryoid type rhabdomyosarcoma and MR was subsequently performed in order to determine extent.  

The presence of intracranial extension resulted in expeditious initiation and radiation and chemotherapy.
