The majority of cases of round pneumonia that are treated with antibiotics have normal chest radiographs 10-14 days later. A small percentage of cases may progress to lobar pneumonia. Cases of round pneumonia usually resolve as quickly as patchy infiltrates with the appropriate antimicrobial therapy. If rapid resolution is not seen, further diagnostic studies are indicated to rule out other causes in the differential.
Consolidation present in right upper lobe region. Patchy areas of atelectasis in bilateral bases with focal atelectasis in the right middle lobe. There are increased interstitial markings.
Round Pneumonia, right upper lobe
Primary malignancy-most lung masses in children are benign;  most likely sarcoma or pulmonary blastoma; suspect if mass has speculated margins; rare in children
Metastases- most commonly come from Wilms’ tumor (nephroblastoma); may also be from osteosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma; usually present as multiple round pulmonary nodules at the lung periphery due to hematogenous spread; usually at the bases; less likely than infection or congenital lesions; more likely than primary lung malignancies
Hamartoma- usually asymptomatic and are rare; usually present in the connective tissue on the outside of the lungs, although about 10% may be on the linings of the bronchi 
Plasma cell granuloma- can present as a mass with calcifications in up to 25% of cases; usually asymptomatic  mildly symptomatic; cannot exclude based on imaging findings, but relatively rare 
Bronchopulmonary sequestration- a congenital mass of nonfunctional lung tissue that is not connected to the bronchial tree; rarely become infected unless it is connected to the gastrointestinal tract; usually occur at the lung bases; more common on the left side; seen as a opaque or partially aerated retrocardiac lesion; must be considered here
Fungal / mycobacterium infection- especially in older patients or immunocompromised hosts
Bronchogenic cyst- may become life threatening if presence of compression, infection, hemorrhage, or rupture
Round atelectasis-from chronic scarring/ thickening of the pleura; are usually basilar, but are rare in children
Cough x 1 week, worsening, has developed fever, congestion, and labored breathing

6 year old boy born term via SVD with subsequent Erb’s palsy (resolved). Past medical history includes congenital hypothyroidism for which he is followed by endocrine. Also a history of minor upper respiratory infections and past surgery for dacryostenosis.
In this particular patient, the history suggest an acute infectious process which was further evaluated by chest radiography. Although most cases of round pneumonia are found in the lower lobes, it can also be found in the upper or middle lobes. This patient was found to have a round pneumonia in the right upper lobe.  With the mean age of diagnosis being age 5, this patient’s age places him in the ideal age range.

Given the clinical scenario and radiographic findings, this is the most likely diagnosis.  If the clinical information is unclear, the patient can be followed closely with a repeat chest radiograph in 24-48 hours. If it is round pneumonia, it will become closer in appearance to lobar pneumonia over a short period of time.
