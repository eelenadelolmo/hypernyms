Total Protein in 24 hours 4598 (42-225mg/24h)

Serum Sodium 131 (137-148)
ESR 82
Pt was given Dilantin and Magnesium until after delivery of child. Follow up MRI was performed 2 months later.
On the first set of images there is subcortical white matter T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity in the occipital and parietal lobes in the distribution of the posterior circulation. There is also abnormal fluid signal in the anterior cerebral/middle cerebral artery watershed area without abnormal gray matter signal. There is mild increased signal on Diffusion Weighted imaging in the areas of high T2 signal intensity, but no associated ADC abnormality to suggest infarct.
Posterior Reversible Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)
Edema from Posterior Reversible Leukoencephalopathy
Ischemia related changes secondary to seizure
Demyelinating process
Posterior circulation ischemia or infarction
20 y.o. pregnant woman (g1p0) with 36WGA intra uterine pregnancy and eclampsia with severe headaches, seizure activity and visual disturbance.
Delivery of child caused remission of clinical symptoms and the follow up MRI had interval resolution of all abnormalities.
