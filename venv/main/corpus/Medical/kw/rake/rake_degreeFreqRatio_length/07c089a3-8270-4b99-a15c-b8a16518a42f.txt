Limited active and passive ranges of motion.
Conservative treatment and followup as needed.
Anterolateral paravertebral flowing ossification of >5 cervical vertebrae.  Preservation of intervertebral disk heights.  Soft-tissue ossification is seen in the posterior neck.
Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis (DISH)
Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), neuropathic arthropathy (Charcot joint), primary osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis.
Neck pain and stiffness.  No history of neck trauma or surgery.
There are case reports in the literature for diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis in the cervical spine, and this is a clear example of DISH according to the diagnostic criteria.  There is flowing ossification of several cervical vertebrae and soft tissue ossification in the posterior neck, and the intervertebral disk heights are spared.
