Texto: 
Severe dyspnea and inspiratory stridor.
The patient needed a percutaneus tracheostomy at ER and subsequently underwent to open repair.
MRI shows severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with fluid level and scarring, sagital images demonstrate the tract created by an emergency tracheostomy. Esophagogram permormed later revealed a traction diverticulum.
Postintubation tracheal stenosis.
Subglottic neoplasm.
Wegener granulomatosis.
Polychondritis.
Sarcoidosis.
28 y.o. man with history of prior head trauma which required prolonged treatment in ICU. He was just discharged 15 days before and now presents with severe inspiratory  stridor.
In this patient tracheal stenosis presented 15 days after he was discharged because of head trauma that required endotracheal intubation for one week. He did not show other previous symptoms than mild dyspnea, not referred to his treating physician.Presenting later with progresive dyspnea and acute inspiratory wheezing.
