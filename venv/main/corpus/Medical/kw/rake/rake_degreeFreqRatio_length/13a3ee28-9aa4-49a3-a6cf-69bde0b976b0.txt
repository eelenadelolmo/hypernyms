Unremarkable except for an enterocutaneous fistula intermittently draining yellow fluid in the vicinity of a surgical scar.
Evidence suggests transient adult enteroenteric intussusception may be more common than originally thought.  Many of these intussusceptions are more readily identified now with the increased use of multidetector CT.  In patients that are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, many of these may be managed conservatively.  Proximal small bowel intussusceptions with a target appearance and without a lead point or obstruction that measure less than 3.5 cm in length, will likely be self-limiting.  Intussusceptions measuring greater than 3.5 cm without lead point or obstruction should probably be further evaluated with additional imaging (eg. small bowel series, enteroclysis, CT enteroclysis, CT or MR enterography).  However, cases demonstrating ischemia, obstruction, or a lead point, require surgical exploration.

Adult intussusception has traditionally been regarded as rare and usually associated with an identifiable cause such as a tumor functioning as a lead point.  However, with recent advancements and increased use of CT technology, transient enteroenteric intussusceptions are being identified; many of which are in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients.
     An intussusception is a medical condition in which a part of the intestine invaginates into another section of intestine, similar to a collapsible telescope.  The part that prolapses into the other is called the intussusceptum, and the part that receives it is called the intussuscipiens.  Usually the intussusception occurs in an antegrade fashion following the direction of peristalsis.   The peristaltic tightening of smooth muscle in the intussuscipiens around the intussusceptum can lead to obstruction, ischemia and necrosis.    
     Presenting symptoms can vary depending on the underlying condition.  Although, ultrasound is generally considered the imaging modality of choice in a young child, CT is more frequently the imaging study by which adult intussusceptions are identified.
     The three CT patterns of intussusception are the target appearance, reniform pattern, and sausage-shaped pattern.  The target appearance is felt to correspond to an early intussusception without ischemia.  
     Proximal transient enteroenteric intussusceptions without an identifiable lead point that measure less than 3.5 cm in length are likely to be self limiting not requiring surgical intervention.  Intussusceptions measuring greater than 3.5 cm without lead point or obstruction should probably be further evaluated with additional imaging (eg. small bowel series, enteroclysis, CT enteroclysis, CT or MR enterography).  However, cases demonstrating ischemia, obstruction, or a lead point, require surgical exploration.
