HIV and Epstien-Barr virus serologies should be performed.  Primary lymphoma of the esophagus is incredibly rare.

Presumably, treatment would have been based on the histopathology of the lymphoma.  Chemotherapy responses to cases of has been primary lymphoma of the esophagus is reported to be poor. 

Obstruction of the esophagus or complication of treatment by tracheo-esophageal fistula can be treated by covered stenting. Obstruction can also be treated with Nd-YAG laser therapy.
A huge sub-mucosal mass arises almost circumferentially from the wall of the esophagus and involves the entire length of the organ as well as the hypopharynx.  This lesion compresses the lumen of the esophagus and displaces the trachea, carina, and azygous vein. 
Editor’s note: the author reports that multiple ill-defined pulmonary nodules were seen although lung window images were not provided.
