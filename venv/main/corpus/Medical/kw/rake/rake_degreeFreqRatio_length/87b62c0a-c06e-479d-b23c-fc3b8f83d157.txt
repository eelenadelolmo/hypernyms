Mild obstructive respiratory symptoms - Prior diagnosis of asthma

Physical exam unremarkable
Patient was returned to clinical care.  Further decisions must be based on patient symptoms as well as the risks of intervention.  Bronchoscopy can be used for confirmation of dynamic obstruction.
Chest Radiographs
-PA: Right sided aortic arch
-Lateral: Convex density projecting along the posterior trachea

MRI
-Right aortic arch
-Aberrant left subclavian artery originating from a Diverticulum of Kommerell

• Right Aortic Arch - Isolated Left Subclavian Artery
15 year-old boy with diagnosis and symptoms of 'asthma.'
Only 5% of patients with a right aortic arch and aberrant left subclavian artery are symptomatic.  Symptoms may vary from respiratory difficulty to dysphagia.  Often patients with symptoms have a prominent Diverticulum of Kommerell as this patient does.

The challenge for this patient's clinicians is whether or not his mild obstructive symptoms are due to the right aortic arch and aberrant left subclavian artery or are merely associated with his underlying asthma.

Treatment options range from conservative options such as medications to surgical intervention such as ligation of the ligamentum arteriosum and reimplantation of the left subclavian artery with or without resection of the diverticulum.
