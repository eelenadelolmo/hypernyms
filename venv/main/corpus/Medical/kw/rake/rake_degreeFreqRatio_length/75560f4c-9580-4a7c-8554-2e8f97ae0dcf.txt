• Radiographic
4.3 x 3 cm area of geographic lytic lesion in the left proximal femoral head.

• CT

• Scintigraphic
Rim of intense increased radiotracer uptake in the left femoral head with central photopenia (doughnut sign)
Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head
• Avascular necrosis
• Metastatic or primary neoplastic disease
• Infection
• Trauma
52 y.o. man presents with trouble urinating.
