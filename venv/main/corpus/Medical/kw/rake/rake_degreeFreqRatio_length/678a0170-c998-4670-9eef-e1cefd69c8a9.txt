Spigelian hernia is a rare type of hernia characterized by herniation of intraabdominal fat or bowel along the lateral border of the rectus sheath at the semilunar line.  The contents of the hernia are characteristically contained by the external oblique aponeurosis.  In a patient with previous laparascopic surgery, a hernia extending through the external oblique aponeurosis in this location may be referred to as a trochar hernia.
