• Smooth, well-corticated, opposing margins.
• No sharp fracture fragments or intra-articular loose bodies.
• No evidence of suprapatellar effusion.

18 y/o man fell down the stairs.  Now with right knee pain, localized to the patella.  Pain is reported as constant and throbbing, increasing to 8-9/10 pain with weight bearing.
Bipartite patella  (BP) is typically an incidental finding, with only 2% being symptomatic.  Symptomatic BP is usually associated with chronic stress injury, although there are reported cases of symptomatic BP following injury.  If the patient continues to have clinical tenderness over his superolateral pole for >3 months, surgery should be considered.
