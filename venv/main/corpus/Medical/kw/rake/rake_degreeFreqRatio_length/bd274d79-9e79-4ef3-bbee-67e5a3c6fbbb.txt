Febrile, Tachycardic
Heparin IV 1,000 U/mL soln @ 1mL/hr while starting PO anticoagulation
Warfarin 10 mg PO qday initial dosing
Study is adequate for the interpretation of pulmonary embolism.  At the first branch point of the left pulmonary artery there is a soft tissue density
 intraluminal filling defect consistent with pulmonary embolism, which
 extends alongside the vessel into subsegmental branches.
Pulmonary Embolism
Pulmonary Embolism - Bland
Pulmonary Embolism - Septic
