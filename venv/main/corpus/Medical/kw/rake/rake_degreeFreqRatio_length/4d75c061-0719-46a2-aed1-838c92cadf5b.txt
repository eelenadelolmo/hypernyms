Vascular surgical repair
Outside CT demonstrates an aneurysm adjacent to the pancreatic head; SMA angiogram demonstrates filling of the SMA branches and presumed aneurysm of a pancreaticoduodenal arcade arterial vessel; of interest, the celiac vessels also fill from an SMA injection, implying retrograde flow through the aneurysm to the hepatic and splenic arteries.  Lateral aortogram demonstrates narrowing of the origin of the celiac axis.
Median arcuate ligament syndrome
Celiac stenosis from atherosclerosis
Celiac narrowing from median arcuate ligament syndrome
Referred from outside institution for angiogram to assess abdominal aneurysm identified on prior CT scan for abdominal pain.
Aneurysms of aortic branch vessels are infrequent; note that there are mural atherosclerotic calcifications in the aneurysm suggesting its presence for a long duration.  The kinked appearance of the origin of the celiac axis is related to median arcuate ligament syndrome.
