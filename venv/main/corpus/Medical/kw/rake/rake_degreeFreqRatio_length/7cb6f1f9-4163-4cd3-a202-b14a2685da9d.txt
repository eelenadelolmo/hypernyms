Texto: 
Marked tenderness to palpation over the distal metaphysis of the left radius, as well as diffuse soft tissue swelling about the left wrist.
The patient's left wrist was casted for three weeks.
Three views of the left wrist show subtle buckling of the cortex at the radial and volar aspects of the distal radius. Normally (i.e., in the absence of such a fracture), the cortex of the distal radial metaphysis is completely smooth.

On the lateral view, volar displacement of and partial obliteration of the pronator quadratus fat pad are noted, findings frquently observed in association with fractures of the distal radius and/or ulna.

Torus fracture/cortical buckle fracture of the distal radius.
An 11 year old Asian female presenting with severe left wrist pain immediately following a fall on her outstretched left hand.
