Unremarkable thyroid gland by physical exam.
Serum calcium:  11.5 mg/dL (8.7-10.4 mg/dL)
Ionized calcium: 6.2 pg/mL (4.8-5.6 pg/mL) 
Parathormone, intact:  226.3 pg/mL (13-75 pg/mL)
The patient is scheduled for parathyroidectomy.  Although specimen pathology is required for the final diagnosis, more than 85% of primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by a parathyroid adenoma and less than 1% is caused by parathyroid carcinoma.
Images reveal normal diffuse radiotracer uptake by the thyroid gland 15 minutes after injection.  Delayed images reveal a focal uptake abnormality, intensifying during the imaging interval relative to the thyroid gland, best localized to the posterior aspect of the inferior third of the left lobe of the thyroid gland. No additional uptake abnormality is detected in the neck and mediastinum.
Parathyroid Adenoma
Parathyroid Adenoma
Parathyroid Carcinoma
50 year-old woman with hypercalcemia and an elevated serum parathyroid hormone concentration.  Ultrasound performed in the clinic revealed a 1 cm mass consistent with a parathyroid adenoma.
