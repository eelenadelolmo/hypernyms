Mid-abdomen pulsatile mass with deep palpitation.
Treatment of abdominal aneurysm includes vascular surgical options such as vascular repair and/or stent placement.  If aneurysms remain stable overtime close observation may also be an effective management strategy.  

Altering risk factors that can aggravate aneurysms such as cessation of smoking, maintaining adequately managing hyperlipidemia & hypertension to help control atherosclerosis.
The axial CT image demonstrates a 2.4-cm fusiform aneurysm of the celiac artery.  The origin of this aneurysm is patent.  Also seen within the celiac aneurysm is an extensive mural thrombosis in the distal half of the aneurysm.  The splenic and
gastroduodenal arteries are patent.  

There also is a fusiform infrarenal aortic aneurysm identified measuring 4 cm.  There is also an intimal flap along the abdominal aortic vasculature.  The aorta returns to normal diameter of 2 cm just prior to the bifurcation of the common iliac arteries.  
 
In addition there is also a distal left common iliac artery dilation with a diameter of 1.5 cm.
Celiac, Abdominal Aorta, & Common Iliac Aneurysms
• Celiac, Abdominal Aortic, Common Iliac Aneurysms:
- Atherosclerotic 
- Inflammatory 
- Mycotic / Infectious
- Arteriovenous Malformation
- Traumatic

An aneurysm is a focal dilation of a arterial vasculature with regard to the primary or adjacent artery. In the abdomen the most typical aneurysm is an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) which is defined as an aortic diameter that should have a normal value at the level of the renal arteries of ranging from 1.4 to 3.0 cm with the average typically being 2.0cm. (1,2).  Iliac aneurysms may be associated with AAA about 16% of the time (3) and most of the time it involves the common iliac artery.  However, celiac artery aneurysms are one of the more uncommon forms of splanchnic artery aneurysm.  The celiac trunk gives rise to the left gastric, common hepatic, and splenic arteries.

As in this case, AAA most often occur in the segment of aorta between the renal and inferior mesenteric arteries. Typically, unlike dissecting thoracic "aneurysms," abdominal aortic aneurysms involve all layers of the aorta and do not usually create an intimal flap or false lumen as in this case.  Mural thrombus may also develop due to poor blood flow/movement through the aneurysm as seen in the celiac artery aneurysm in this case.

The most common risk factors for developing abdominal aneurysms include age (>60), smoking, sex (>males), race (2x more common in whites as opposed to blacks), atherosclerosis, hypertension, and family history.  The USPSTF recommends that men ages 65 – 75 who smoke should get a one time screen for AAA via the preferred modality of real-time ultrasonography (4).  CT and MRI are alternative imaging modalities that may also be used.
