Right sided shoulder weakness
OTC analgesics can be used to control any associated pain in the acute setting.  Otherwise, no directed therapy is indicated.
â€¢ On T1 weighted imaging, moderate muscular body atrophy and fatty replacement within a single or multiple rotator cuff or shoulder muscles.  â€¢ Abnormal increased increased T2 or STIR signal will also be seen in these affected muscles.

33 y.o. man with right shoulder pain and decreased range of motion.  No history of trauma or overuse.
Parsonage-Turner syndrome (PTS), also known as acute brachial neuritis and neuralgic amyotrophy, defines a set of symptoms resulting from inflammation of the brachial plexus. 

PTS is idiopathic in etiology, but thought to be post viral and may follow illness, surgery, or immunization.  Up to 50% report viral illness or vaccination that occurred days to weeks prior to onset of symptoms.

Parsonage Turner syndrome presents as the acute onset of severe shoulder pain followed shortly thereafter by weakness of at least one shoulder muscle.  Bilateral involvement has been reported for as many as one third of patients.  It can be confused clinically with cervical spondylosis, rotator cuff tear, shoulder impingement syndrome, and acute calcific tendonitis.  Failure to identify PTS may result in inappropriate treatment or potnentially unnecessary surgery.

PTS may involve single or multiple nerves originating from the brachial plexus.  The suprascapular is the most commonly affected (97% of cases), followed by the axillary (50% of cases) and far less commonly the subscapular and long thoracic.  In cases involving the suprascapular nerve, the supraspinatous and infraspinatous muscles are affected.  Inflammation of the subscapular nerve affects the subscapularis muscle.  The serratous anterior muscle is affected when the long thoracic nerve is involved, and the teres minor and deltoid muscles are affected in cases involving an axillary nerve distribution.

The MR finding most typical of PTS is that of diffuse high T2 signal involving one or more muscles innervated by the brachial plexus.  T1-weighted images may also show atrophy of the affected muscle(s). The pattern of muscular involvement should match the distribution(s) of one or more peripheral nerves originating from the brachial plexus

No test can be used to diagnose PTS specifically. Both electromyograms and MR images must be interpreted with consideration of the clinical history.  The disorder is self-limited, but can take up to a year to resolve.  Residual denervation can be seen in 10-20% of cases after 2 years.
