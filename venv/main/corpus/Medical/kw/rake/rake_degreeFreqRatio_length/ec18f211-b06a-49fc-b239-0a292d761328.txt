Very good clinical condition, no weight loss, no abnormal physical signs except for loss of pulmonary sounds anteriorly in the right hemithorax.
Laboratory data: normal.
EKG and Echocardiogram: normal.
Patient is on adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide.
Chest X-Rays with marked abnormality in the right hemithorax, projected anteriorly.
CT scan - inhomogenous mass in th anterior mediastinum with calcification.
PET/CT: the lesion is avid to the F18-FDG tracer and 2 small lymph nodes were seen in the superior and superior and medial aspects of the mass.
Surgical specimen: a huge mass including the pericardium and the right phrenic nerve.

A 54 year old asymptomatic physician
The patient had a chest X-ray that showed a huge anterior right chest mass (Figures 1,2). He underwent a CT scan and an inhomogeneous mass with small areas of calcification was seen in the anterior mediastinum (Figures 3,4). A core needle biopsy (5 specimens) was obtained and the diagnosis was thymic neuroendocrine carcinoma (carcinoid). A PET/CT was done  and showed marked captation of the F18-FDG in the lesion along with 2 small mediastinal nodes (Figures 5,6). No other lesions were seen.

The patient was operated on by median sternotomy plus right anterior thoracotomy. The mass was invading the pericardium including the rigth phrenic nerve. The lesion was completely resected along with the pericardium and the phrenic nerve (Figure 7) and the small amount of pericardial fluid found at thoracotomy was positive for malignancy.

The postoperative time was uneventful and the patient was discharged in the 5th PO.

This patient was asymptomatic with a huge malignant mediastinal mass. This is very unusual in clinical practice. The lesion had a pre-operative diagnosis of thymic neuroendocrine carcinoma (carcinoid) by core needle biopsy and was completely (macroscopically) resected. Chemotherapy was ellected as the adjuvant treatment. Radiotherapy was not indicated because of the extension of the lesion and consequently extension of radiotherapy fields. Also the presence of pericardial invasion and malignant pericardial effusion turned the planning of radiotherapy a very difficult task. The treatment for this kind of lesion is multidisciplinar: radical surgical resection (if possible), chemotherapy and radiotherapy (if possible). The relapses are better treated with reoperation.
