Texto: 
calcium 10.5 (8.8-10.4)
phosphorous 2.6 (2.5-4.5)
alk phos 844 (70-250)
calcidiol 11 (13-67)
1,25 OH Vit D 126
FT4 and Thyroid stimulating hormone were normal
Metaphyseal cupping, fraying and irregularity at sites of rapid growth, including anterior ribs, long bones of the lower extremities and the wrists
Rickets
Renal disease: 
-renal osteodystrophy (most common cause) 
-renal tubular disorders: vitamin D-resistant rickets 
cystinosis and X-linked hypophosphatemia. 
Vitamin D deficiency: dietary lack (rare in U.S.), malabsorption. 
Hepatocellular and biliary disease. 
Anticonvulsant drug therapy: Dilantin, Phenobarbitol. 
Tumor-associated rickets: associated neoplasms are in bone or 
soft tissue. Most frequently hemangiopericytoma. Other lesions include nonossifying fibroma, giant cell tumor, osteoblastoma.
1 YEAR OLD FEMALE WHO PRESENTED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WITH COMPLAINT OF COUGH AND FEVER.  INCIDENTAL FINDING OF DIFFUSE BILATERAL COSTOCHONDRAL CUPPING ON CHEST FILM LEAD TO FURTHER WORK UP.
