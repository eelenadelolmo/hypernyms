IGF-1: 21 ng/mL (normal 74-202 ng/mL)
The sagittal T1W image show the absence of the normal posterior pituitary bright spot within the sella turcica.  The sella and the anterior pituitary are small.  An area of high signal is seen within a truncated pituitary stalk representing an ectopic posterior pituitary gland.   The abnormal location of the posterior pituitary is also seen on the T1W coronal image.

Following the administration of intravenous gadolinium, there is normal enhancement of the gland and stalk.
Posterior pituitary ectopia (PPE)
• Ectopic posterior pituitary
• Lipoma
• Tuber cinereum harmartoma
• Dermoid/Epidermoid
• Craniopharyngioma
• Rathke Cleft Cyst
Patient is a 3 year old girl who presents with growth failure and short stature.  She has always been small but is now falling off the growth curve.  There are no other complaints at this time except for constipation which has been long standing.
