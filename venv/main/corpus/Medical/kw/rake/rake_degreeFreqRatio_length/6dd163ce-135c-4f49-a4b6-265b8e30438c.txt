BP 158/65, P 91, intubation O2sats 100%
GCS 3
Bilateral chest tubes and bilateral breath sounds on lung exam.
Patient maintained in ICU with supportive care.
Plan is to eventually transfer pt to WRAMC.
Pneumomediastinum with air in the anterior aspect tracking  up to the thoracic inlet.
Subcutaneous air noted adjacent to the chest tubes and running up into the axilla bilaterally.
Pneumothoraces bilaterally.
Left subclavian line, endotracheal tube, enteric tube, and bilateral chest tubes appropriately placed.
Pneumomediastinum from Blast Trauma
Barotrauma
Penetrating injury to neck or chest
positive pressure ventilation
esophageal rupture
postoperative mediastinitis
24 yo man with IED blast injury from OIF with penetrating brain injury.  He underwent a decompressive right hemicraniectomy at the 10th CSH.  CT chest showed bilateral pneumothoraces and pneumomediastinum, therefore  bilateral chest tubes were placed.  Patient was then transported to LRAMC, and finally NNMC for definitive care.
A retrospective study of blast lung injury in Israel found that BLI is not commonly lethal if sufficiently treated, but a large majority (76%) require intubation and mechanical ventilation.  Out of 29 patients who met the BLI inclusion criteria of hypoxia and pulmonary infiltrates on CXR, 3 patients had pneumomediastinum and 12 patients sustained pneumothorax.  None of those patients had penetration injuries to the neck or chest.  Blast lung injury is the second most common primary blast injury (ruptured tympanic membrane is first).  The pressure wave from explosive devices causes a transient increase in intrathoracic pressure, leading to alveolar rupture and air dissecting into surrounding tissues.
On CXR, the pulmonary infiltrates found in those with BLI occur centrally (bat wing appearance), which can help differentiate from the pleural infiltrates of blunt trauma.
