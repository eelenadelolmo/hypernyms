A pulse, rather than a thrill, is felt in the region of the left arm fistula.  The patients left arm is edematous.  The left hand is warm and the radial pulse can be palpated.
AV fistulas for dialysis should be monitored for:

1. Venous pressure >140 mm Hg at a dialyzer flow of 200 ml/min
2. Dialyzer blood flow of >200 to ml/min
3. Difficulties in fistula access

A fistulagram should be performed if any of these criteria are met.

Chronic left brachiocephalic vein stenosis
Sub-acute complete occlusion
Angioplasty and stenting of the occlusion
Stent Placement for Recurrent Central Venous Occlusion
Central venous stenosis or central venous occlusion can be due to a number of disparate primary pathologies:

Chronic local venous hypertension in the arm of a dialysis patient, Paget Schroder syndrome in an athlete using anabolic steroids, fibrosis due to indwelling pacemaker leads, and superior vena cava syndrome due to cancer are some of the more common of these processes.

Lymphedema (subsequent to axiallary node dissection or other etiology)
73 year old man with ESRD presents with severe left arm swelling following regular dialysis.  

When questioned he reports that the size of his arm has increased significantly over the preceding 2 weeks.
Venous stent patency rate are lower than arterial stent patency rates.  Stents are not commonly placed for central venous stenosis or occlusion.

In this case, recurrent severe symptoms were present that were refractory to multiple venoplasty procedures, necessitating stent placement as a last resort to preserve patency of the fistula
