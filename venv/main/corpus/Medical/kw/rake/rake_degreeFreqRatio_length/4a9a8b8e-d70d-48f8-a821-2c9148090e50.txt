Texto: 
abnormal physical exam finding on the left side discovered at her routine annual gynecology appointment
On multiple US images a complex adnexal mass is seen with both solid and cystic components.  No signifcant blood flow (lack of color) present.

On CT, the lesion is seen to extent from the left ovary with multiple areas of calcification that likely represent teeth. Fat attenuation tissue and cystic components are noted.
Cystic Teratoma
Based on the US the DDX includes:
Cystadenoma
Hemorrhagic cyst
Endometrioma
Ectopic pregnancy
Teratoma (dermoid)
Abscess
Hematoma

When taken with the CT findings the DDX becomes:
Teratoma (dermoid)
asymptomatic
