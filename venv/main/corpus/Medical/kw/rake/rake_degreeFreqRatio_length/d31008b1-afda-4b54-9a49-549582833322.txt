CN III-XII - intact
Motor - 5/5 in all areas measured both UE/LE
Reflexes - 3+ diffusely, positive Babinski’s bilat
Sensory - Decreased vibratory sense b/l LE.  Intact LT, PP, cold, and proprioception in b/l UE/LE. Negative Romberg

Gait: Broad-based
The patient was treated with 3 mL of local intra-arterial fibrinolysis, microballoon angioplasty, followed by stenting of the basilar artery.
The patient's imaging and angiography shows an acute occlusion of the basilar artery successfully treated with localized intra-arterial fibrinolysis, angioplasty, and stenting of the basilar artery.
Acute Basilar Occlusion
1. Acute Basilar Occlusion
2. Vertebrobasilar Insufficiency
3. Basilar aneurysm
The patient is a 63-year-old white male with a history significant for HTN, HLD presenting with a one week history of vertigo, dysarthria, and  left lower quadrant visual field deficits associated with nausea and vomiting. He experienced a transient 5-minute episode of vertigo upon standing provoking trip to ER.

On his second hospital day, the patient reported worsening of vertigo in conjunction with tinnitus.  Over the next two hours, he was noted to to have a progressive decline in mental status resulting in a code being called.
