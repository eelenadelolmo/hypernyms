Facial fracture.
Calcification of the stylohyoid ligament and pseudoarthrosis with the hyoid bone as seen on both axial CT and 3D reformatted images.

An additional reformatted CT image demonstrates depressed left frontal bone fracture which was the reason for seeking medical attention.
Eagle Syndrome
None.
Adult male approximately 50 years old who was attacked with a hammer.
This case demonstrates Eagle syndrome as previously described but with the additional finding of pseudoarthrosis of the stylohyoid ligament.  This incidental finding is incompletely imaged.  Since the patient's primary medical problem was related to facial fracture, no further imaging at the level of the hyoid bone was indicated.
