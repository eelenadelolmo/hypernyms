Unremarkable, except for high level of Hepatitis C particles
Medical therapy
Liver and spleen demonstrate homogeneously physiologic uptake On the posterior projection, the intensity of activity in the spleen is equal to that in the liver. Marrow uptake is, however, apparent (most likely as result of formatting or "gray-scaling").

Hepatitis C
This case is presented to point out that some marrow uptake may be seen on normal liver spleen scan images. This is a result of formatting or "gray-scaling" of the images and should not necessarily be considered evidence of pathology. Intense marrow uptake would be suggestive of a "colloid shift", although corroboration in the form of an increased spleen to liver uptake ratio should also be present. Lung uptake may also be seen in the setting of significant liver dysfunction and a significant "colloid shift". It is important to remember that improperly prepared radiotracer (i.e. predominance of particles less than 0.5 microns, e.g. from occult filtering) can artifactually result in findings suggesting a "colloid shift".
