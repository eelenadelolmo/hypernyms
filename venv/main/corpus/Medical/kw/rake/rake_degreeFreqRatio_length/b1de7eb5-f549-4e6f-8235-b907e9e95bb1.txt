Possible limb legnth discrepency with minor tenderness to both hips upon exam.
Fixation of femoral epiphysis with orthopedic pins
There are bilateral right worse then left femoral epiphyseal plate fractures with widened growth plates.  Varus deformity is present.
SCFE - Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis
Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE.)
Legg Calve Perthes Disease (LCP.)
  > AVN of the femoral heads in white males 5-8 yrs old. 
  > WIdened joint.
  > Subcondral Fissure fracture.
Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip.
A 12 year old overweight african american male presents with bilateral hip pain for greater then 6 months after running track at his school.
SCFE is similar to a Salter Harris type 1 fracture of the proximal femur.  This commonly occurs in overweight african american teenagers.  The history may include pain and possible trauma. 

As discribed above, the treatment includes fixation with orthopedic pins or bone pegs. Complications that can be encountered are osteonecrosis, chondrolysis, varus deformity (as seen in this patient), and osteoarthritis.
