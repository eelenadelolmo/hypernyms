Edema and enhancment at L4 and L5 vertebral bodies on MRI with small epidural collection.

57 year old male currently being treated for rheumatoid arthritis with steroids and Humira.  Patient developed back pain not relieved by rest or analgesics.
This was not thought to be MRSA based on the cultures obtained in May, 2012.  Lack of treatment response is attributed to patient non-compliance or immune suppresion.
