•Lymphomas are divided into Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s.
•Hodgkin’s lymphoma is characterized by Reed-Sternberg cells, with 4 subtypes.
•In the thorax, nodular sclerosing is the most common subtype with a predilection for the mediastinum.
•Nodular sclerosing accounts for >50% of Hodgkin’s lymphomas.
•Frequency - In the US, 7400 estimated new cases in 2001
•Bimodal distribution - 15-40 years old, >55 years old
•Treatment consists of radiation and/or chemotherapy
•Survival rates, 1yr-93%, 5yr-82%, 10yr-72%, 15yr-63%
