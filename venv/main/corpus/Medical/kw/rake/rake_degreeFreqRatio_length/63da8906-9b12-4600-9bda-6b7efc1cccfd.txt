Sacral dimple. No drainage or hair tufts seen. No neurologic findings.
None.
The normal neonatal spinal cord is displayed on ultrasound as a tubular hypoechoic structure with hyperechoic walls. The central canal is hyperechoic, the so-called central echo complex. The subarachnoid space surrounding the cord is hypoechoic. The caudal end of the spinal cord corresponds with the conus medullaris, which continues into the filum terminale. The cauda equina is seen as echogenic linear structures surrounding a hyperechoic filum terminale. The vertebral bodies are seen as echogenic structures ventral to the spinal cord. Viewed axially, the spinal cord is hypoechoic and round or oval-shaped, lying within the anechoic subarachnoid space. The spinal cord is fixed by dentate ligaments that pass laterally from the spinal cord. Echogenic nerve roots are seen below the level of L2. 



Particular features to note are: 
-The position of the cord in a dorsal/ventral or anterior/posterior orientation. In normal infants the cord lies a third to half way between the anterior and posterior walls of the spinal canal. If the cord lies more posteriorly, tethering should be suspected. 
-The presence of normal pulsatile movement of the cord and nerve roots (tethering leads to an absence of pulsatility).  Evaluated on real time examination. 
-The thickness of the filum terminale (normal 2 mm or less). 
-The level of the conus medullaris. In term infants the tip of the conus medullaris normally lies above the mid level of the L2 vertebral body although there is a large range of normality (from T10/11 to L2/3). In pre-term infants the tip of the conus lies between L2 and L4, i.e. the level of the conus moves proximally with age . A low-lying cord may imply tethering.
Normal Ultrasound of the Spine

One week old male who on physical exam was found to have a midline sacral dimple, the base of which could not be adequately evaluated.
