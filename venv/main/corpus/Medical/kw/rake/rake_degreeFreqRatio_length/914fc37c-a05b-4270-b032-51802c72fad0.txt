Physical examination reveals tenderness and swelling at the proximal carpal row and crepitus with movement of the wrist.
Dorsal capsulodesis is the preferred method with high non-union rates with scapho-lunate fusion (90%).
There is an abnormal separation between the scaphoid and the lunate in the right wrist which measures greater than 4 mm.  Note the left wrist comparison view which demonstrates a normal scapho-lunate separation (averages about 2 mm in most patients).
Scapholunate dissociation (rotary scaphoid subluxation)
Differential Diagnosis:
Scapho-lunate dissociation
Anatomic variant
Sequelae of old trauma
32 y/o female complaining of right wrist pain after falling on her outstretched hand.
A scapho-lunate dislocation is the most common and significant ligamentous injury to the wrist.  Risk factors include negative ulnar variance and luno-triquetral coalition.  The injury mechanism is axial compression, usually with the wrist deviated in an ulnar direction.  Three ligaments bind the scaphoid to the lunate, and two out of three must be injured for dissociation to occur.  Normal separation averages 2 mm, and there may be up to 8 mm separation with dissociation.
