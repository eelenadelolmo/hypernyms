Texto: 
Physical exam is unremarkable and consistent with early pregnancy.  Quantitative beta-hCG = 94,000 mIU/ml.
Patient underwent a D&C shortly after diagnosis.  Surgical pathology specimens confirmed complete molar pregnancy.  Chest films were negative for evidence of metastatic choriocarcinoma at the time of D&C.
Classic “snowstorm” appearance on ultrasound examination - contents of uterus appear of heterogeneous echogenicity displaying both cystic and solid areas.  Color flow doppler reveals mildly increased vascularity.
Molar Pregnancy (Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia)
- Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (hydatidiform mole)
- Retained products of conception (missed or incomplete abortion)
- Hydropic degeneration of placenta
- Previous exposure to tamoxifen (a selective estrogen receptor modulator) may result in endometrial cysts (no history of tamoxifen exposure in this patient)
19-year-old G1 female presents for a routine dating ultrasound.  She is 12 weeks 1 day by last menstrual period.
