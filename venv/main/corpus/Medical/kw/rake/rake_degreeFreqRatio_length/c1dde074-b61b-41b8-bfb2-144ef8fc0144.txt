Texto: 
Phyisical exam was noncontributory.  Laboratory values were remarkable for an elevated ESR.
Sagittal T1w, proton density, and T2w images demonstrate loss of disk space height at L3/4 with adjacent marrow edema.  A small abnormal fluid collection is seen anterior to the L3 vertebral body suggests an abscess.   
Bone scan and Gallium studies demonstrate abnormal accumulation of radiotrace at the L3/4 diskspace that is consistent with osteomyelitis.
Diskitis
Pyogenic infectious spondylodiskitis
Chronic osteomyelitis
Chronic degenerative disk disease
19 year old male with low back pain and fever.
