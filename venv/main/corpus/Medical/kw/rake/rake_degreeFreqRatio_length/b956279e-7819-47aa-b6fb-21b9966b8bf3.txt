Texto: 
Normal gravid physical examination and laboratory values without active vaginal bleeding.
Bed rest or restriction from normal activity levels may help to ensure that bleeding does not recur. A spontaneous abortion becomes more likely if the bleeding continues and should prompt a return for further medical attention.
There is a hypoechoic fluid collection external to the amniotic sac at the lower uterine segment just above the internal os of the cervix.  This collection is about 5 cm long and 1 cm in thickness in a crescent around the periphery of the gestation. The doppler flow image demonstrates no flow within the fluid collection.
Subchorionic hemorrhage
This appearance is typical for a subchorionic hemorrhage although a reabsorbing gestational sac in a multiple gestation pregnancy or normal chorioamniotic separation with fluid before 10 weeks might present a similar sonographic appearance.
19 year old pregnant woman with vaginal bleeding at home.
The combination of hypoechoic fluid collection, absence of flow by doppler and the patient's history of vaginal bleeding make the diagnosis of subchorionic hemorrhage likely.
