The patient was resuscitated using IVF and PRBCs, and given TPN for nutrition throughout his hospital stay. He was continued on mechanical ventilation. He was initially treated with Dopamine and Norepinephrine to maintain BP, then switched to continuous Labetalol and a Colonidine patch after he developed hypertension. These were then switched again to Epinephrine and continuous Norepinephrine when he developed hypotension on hospital day 6. He remained NPO with NG tube on low intermittent suction throughout his stay. His grade 2 liver laceration was non-operative. Wounds were treated with topical Bacitracin and he was given the typical ICU and perioperative antibiotics. A Lt frontal ventriculostomy was placed for ICP and CPP monitoring. For his traumatic cerebral edema, he was treated with 3% saline, Mannitol, and Decadron. He developed elevated ICP and was taken to the OR for bifrontal craniectomy with dural flaps. While he continued to have spontaneous agonal respirations, he remained unresponsive throughout his stay, with no pupillary responses, and absent cough/gag/corneal reflexes. He developed bilaterally dilated non-reactive pupils on hospital day 6, at which point MRI showed increased cerebral edema, 4th ventricular effacement, and downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils. Given these findings his mother expressed her wishes to withdraw care and make the patient an organ donor.
CXR AP Portable:
  - Moderate sized pulmonary contusion in RLL with a smaller pulmonary contusion in the LLL
  - Fracture of distal Rt humerus noted

CT Abdomen + Pelvis w/contrast:
  - Grade 2 liver laceration involving posterior Rt lobe
  - Dense enhancement of bowel wall consistent with hypotension
  - Moderate sized pulmonary contusion RLL without plural fluid or pneumothorax
  - Distended urinary bladder with catheter in position
  - Soft tissue edema in the inguinal region bilaterally with a small vascular catheter on the Lt not extending into the femoral vein

CT Head + C-spine  w/o contrast:
  - Severe traumatic brain injury with Lt temporal/parietal skull fracture and generalized brain swelling. Basilar cisterns and ventricles almost completely obliterated.
  - Cervical-occipital dissociation and atlanto-axial dissociation
Atlanto-occipital Disassociation
1. Given the patients history, and initial presentation with skull deformities and a GCS of 3, some form of severe traumatic brain injury is very likely. Possible causes include intracranial hemorrhage and/or subdural or epidural hematoma.
2. Another possibility is diffuse ischemic organ damage given that the patient was in cardiac arrest for an estimated 25-40 minutes. 
3. The patients vitals and PE also suggest hypovolemic shock as a possible factor.
The patient is a previously healthy child who was admitted after being stuck by a car (MVC vs. pedestrian) under unknown circumstances. EMS arrived at the scene and found the patient lying in the street unconscious, in full arrest with Pulseless Electrical Activity. He arrived still in PEA at an outlying facility where he was successfully resuscitated (using Epi x 2, Atropine x 1) approximately 25-40 minutes after being struck. He was then transferred to the pediatric subspeciality institution for definitive care.
While atlanto-occipital disassociation typically occurs as the result of traumatic injury, it is most commonly associated with someone who is a passenger in a MVA. Airbag deployment typically causes forced hyperextension of the neck. This patient was struck by a motor vehicle as a pedestrian. As a result of this, he suffered multiple severe injuries including traumatic brain injury associated with a parietal/temporal fracture, grade 2 liver laceration, pulmonary contusions, and fracture of the distal humerus. These concomitant injuries, specifically the TBI, made this patients survival much less likely than if he had presented only with A-O disassociation. This patient never reached the point where occipitocervical fusion was pursued for treatment.
