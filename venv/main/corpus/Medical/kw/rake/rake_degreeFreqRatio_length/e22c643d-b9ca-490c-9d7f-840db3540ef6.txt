Zenker's Diverticulum
There is no differential for this appearance.  It is a Zenker's diverticulum.
S/P Zenker's Diverticulum Repair one year ago with progressive return and worsening of symptoms - dysphagia, regurgitation. 

Per patient's report, surgery involved widening of the Zenker's opening, allegedly so that any ingested material would not become trapped within.
