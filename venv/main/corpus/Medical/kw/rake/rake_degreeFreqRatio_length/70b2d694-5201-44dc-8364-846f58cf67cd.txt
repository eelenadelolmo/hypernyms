Acute onset of abdominal pain today with no fever, emesis, diarrhea or trauma.  No significant past medical history.
In addition to the comments made in the factoid, one should note that surgery is not a treatment for segmental omental infarct.  Histologic diagnosis is therefore very rare.  Most patients have no follow-up imaging.
