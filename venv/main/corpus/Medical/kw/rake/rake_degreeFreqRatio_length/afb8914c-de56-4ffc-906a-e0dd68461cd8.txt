She is 5 foot 1 inches tall and weighs 203 pounds. Ranges of motion were measured by Dual Inclinometry.  Findings were compared to “normal” from The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment 5th Edition.  Active range of motion of the cervical spine revealed flexion to be accomplished to 25°/50°, left rotation to 20°/80°, right rotation to 20°/80°, left lateral bending to 5°/45°, right lateral bending to 23°/45° and extension to 27°/60°.  She reports neck pain during flexion, left lateral bending, right lateral bending and extension.  
Reflexes of the bicep and tricep were graded 2/4 bilaterally.  Cervical distraction was unremarkable.  Cervical compression testing produced reported neck pain that radiated to the right shoulder.  Active range of motion of the shoulders revealed that the right shoulder could only be elevated to 120° due to right shoulder pain.  Muscle strengths of the upper extremities revealed a generalized weakness of the right shoulder muscles due to pain and discomfort.  Neer’s testing revealed the right shoulder could be elevated to 100° with reported right shoulder pain.  The Hawkins-Kennedy and supraspinatus procedures were positive on the right side.  Such shoulder testing was negative on the left.
Pt is awaiting total right shoulder arthoplasty
MRI of shoulder- There is avascular necrosis of the medial superior humeral head. There is mild supraspinatus tendinosis 

CT of shoulder- Initial CT evaluation: Advanced Osteoarthritis of the right shoulder,  with an area of mild cortical impaction.  Later and on addendum: MRI examination of the right shoulder performed at has been made available for correlation.  There is marked progression of cystic changes associated with area of avascular necrosis in the posterosuperior articular surface of the humerus head at site of now noted mild impaction injury.  Findings are consistent with progressive posttraumatic changes and posttraumatic injury to the humerus head.  In addition, there has been acceleration of the degenerative subchondral cystic changes of the articular surface of the glenoid compared to the prior examination.

This 63 y.o. woman who was involved in a motor vehicle accident in August.  At the time of the accident she was in front passenger seat when her vehicle was T-boned. During the accident she states that her right shoulder impacted the side door.  She denied any lost of consciences. She was taken by ambulance to the hospital. At the hospital xrays were taken of her hip and she was discharged on 600mg of ibuprofen. The following day after her accident she states she starting having 10/10 pain in her right shoulder that would radiate down her arm to the level of the elbow.  She reports that the pain limited her mobility in her right arm. 

Pt has past medical history which is significant for bilateral knee replacements and gout.  Medications include:  Bystolic, allopurinol, Singulair, Ventolin, indomethacin, lisinopril, and furosemide.    She began using a nebulizer 2 months prior to the MVA with budesonide and performist for shortness of breath. 

The patient continued to have chronic right shoulder pain, so a MRI of the shoulder was obtained two months following the accident.

The differential diagnosis of cervical and shoulder problems on examination is of importance as the symptoms of each can produce pain and discomfort in the other associated region.  In this case cervical compression testing produced pain that radiated to the right shoulder.  Shoulder testing as noted in the exam region was positive for impingement/rotator cuff tendon involvement.  Subsequently then MRI of the cervical and shoulder regions were performed.  On imaging of the cervical spine were findings of discopathy and foraminal compromise, the latter most prominently noted at the C4/C5 level.  The C5 nerve root exits from that level and services the area of the deltoid region.   Such in combination with other findings on exam suggested radiculopathy.  EMG evaluation did not confirm radiculopathy, though she may still have such, as EMG is only 50-71% sensitive. (AAEM) 

Avascular necrosis can occur from a number of etilogies (Gaillard et al) including: trauma (fracture or dislocation), Caisson disease, haemoglobinopathies, e.g. Sickle cell disease, pregnancy related AVN, radiotherapy, connective tissue disorders, renal transplantation, corticosteroid excess (both endogenous and exogenous), pancreatitis, gout, Gaucher"s disease, alcohol.  When such is present in the humeral head such is referred to as Hass disease.  The closest imaging to the time of injury was performed two months post-trauma.  That initial MRI confirmed a diagnosis of AVN with Crescent sign and by definition - Cruess classification III indicating subchondral fracture.  AVN  can typically occur after trauma severe enough to result in multiple-part fractures or dislocations that compromise bone blood supply (Lee & Hensen, 1981).  Therefore, the trauma endured may not have been the cause of the patient’s AVN.  However, the trauma can be the cause of the impaction fracture as noted on CT, 5 months post MVA as per conversation/addendum with the radiologist who performed an overall assessment of the MRI, plain film radiography and CT scan (contributor GG).  While it is possible that the impaction fracture was present from the initial trauma, such a small fracture is unlikely to disrupt the blood supply to the extent needed to cause AVN (Allard, Porter, & Ryerson, 1992).  In conversation with the attending Orthopedist on the case (contributor GG), and per report he states, "Therefore, based upon the information that I have available to me at this time, it is my opinion that the trauma of the above documented motor vehicle accident has produced significant injury(ies) rendering (the patient) to be symptomatic and require the medical treatment documented above including the potential need for surgical intervention."   The patient does have multiple risk factors for AVN, favoring a pre-existent etiology of AVN.  Such include hypertension, gout and corticosteroid use.  

With no imaging of the shoulder prior to the injury, it remains unclear why this patient developed AVN.  While the trauma was not as severe as to normally lead to AVN, possibly the patient was predisposed because of her underlying risk factors.  As the literature suggests, most etiologies of AVN are multifactorial, commonly without a clear cause.  As such the literature and evaluation in this case would favor the presence of AVN to be pre-existing to the MVA.  

What is clear is that the patient was asymptomatic prior to the MVA with reported full range of motion of the shoulder without pain.  She now has an impaction fracture.  In conversation with the orthopedist on the case (contributor GG) and also per report he concludes:  "... trauma of the motor vehicle accident has produced significant injury thereby activating and/or aggravating a pre-existing previously asymptomatic condition --with the trauma of the motor vehicle accident thereby rendering this condition to become symptomatic and therefore requiring medical treatment."  In conclusion then the AVN may likely be pre-existing to the MVA but it is the MVA that has now caused the need for surgical intervention.
