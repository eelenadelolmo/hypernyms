Palpable mass left breast 0800.
Pt had a left breast mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy.Sentinel node negative; touch prep diagnosis of post mastectomy: no metastatic carcinoma identified.
: Routine 2-view mammography with palpable mass tagged on left breast—Breast tissue dense, poorly defined 2.2cm mass at 0800 position in posterior third of left breast. No other films for comparison. Transverse/longitudinal US—lobulated mass with irregular borders measuring approximately 2 x 1cm in size.
Infiltrating ductal carcinoma
Malignancy (invasive carcinoma (ductal/lobular), fibroadenoma, phyllodes tumor
39 y/o female presented with a palpable mass on left breast at 0800 position
According to the American Cancer Society , almost 217,000 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed by the end of 2004. The most common form of breast cancer, accounting for more than 75 percent of diagnoses, is infiltrating (invasive) ductal carcinoma. This cancer originates within the mammary ducts and penetrates through the ductal walls invading into the surrounding fatty tissue of the breast. This 39-year-old woman found a palpable mass that turned out to be a breast cancer. Because this patient had fibrocystic changes of her breast, the mammogram was not very definitive, but the ultrasound was very important in distinguishing the malignancy potential of the mass. As an adjunct to mammography, ultrasound has become an important tool in evaluating the breast .Only about 25% of breast carcinomas will metastasize to a distant site with, unfortunately, 95% of those patients dying from their metastatic disease. Metastasis of the breast to varying distant sites is by way of the angiolymphatic system, making it very important to monitor lymph nodes and lymphatic ductal invasion on gross specimen. Axillary lymph nodes are the first nodes seeding with breast carcinoma metastasis. For this patient, her sentinel lymph node was negative. Current success rates for the predictive value of sentinel node biopsy are variable with the surgeon performing the procedure and the characteristics of the patient involved .
