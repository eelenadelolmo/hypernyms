Patient was asymptomatic therefore required no treatment for Syrinx or Chiari I.
Is pending Neuro Surgery Evaluation for sponduloarthropathy/nerve root compromise.
Cervical Spine MR: The most concerning finding is a syrinx within the substance of the cervical spinal cord, extending from the base of the dens to the C5-6 level.  The syrinx measures approximately  7.8 cm superior to inferior with a maximum diameter of 6 mm.  The caliber of the spinal cord is not significantly expanded.  There is also significantly low-lying cerebellar tonsils descending through the foramen magnum by approximately 14 mm.  The cerebellar tonsils appear pegged and the structures at the level of the foramen magnum are significantly congested.  There is no pathologic enhancement following gadolinium-DTPA.  The remainder of the exam demonstrated multilevel cervical spondyloarthropathy compounded by developmentally narrowed central bony canal (secondary to short pedicles) with potential compromise of the left C7 nerve root
Syrinx associated with Chiari I Malformation
