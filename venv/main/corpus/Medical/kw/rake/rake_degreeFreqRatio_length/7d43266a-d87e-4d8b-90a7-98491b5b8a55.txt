Texto: 
Right lower quadrant tenderness with moderate increase in WBC count. +nausea and little emesis.
Excision of involved bowel with re-anastomosis. Later development of ileus with non-surgical management pursued.
Well-circumscribed 5.1 x 3.9 cm cystic mass with dependent peripherally calcified densities within that are faceted and almost appear to have a cortex. Presence of peri-lesional free fluid but no clear connection of lesion with bowel.
Meckel's Diverticulum with what are listed as Fecoliths
ectopic appendix with fecalith
enteric duplication cyst
RLQ pain presenting to ER to r/o appendicitis.
2 large fecaliths within larger than average-sized Meckel's diverticulum in a patient outside of the usual presenting age.  We wanted genetic testing on those "fecoliths"....they look a lot like pigs knuckles.  A case of Southern-Fried abdominal pain!
