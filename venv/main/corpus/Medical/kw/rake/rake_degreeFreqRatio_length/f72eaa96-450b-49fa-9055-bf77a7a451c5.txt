Texto: 
Thin hirsuite hispanic female in no apparent distress.  Pelvic exam demonstrates vulvar irregularities and questionable clitoralmegaly.  Bi-manual exam is normal.

Labs show increased levels of 17 hydroxy progesterone in blood and elevated 17-ketosteroids in urine.
Patient was put on hormone therapy and instructed to follow up with endocrinology after genetic counseling.
Contrast enhanced CT image through the adrenals shows marked symmetric enlargement of the adrenals and no other significant abnormality.
Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia
Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia
Cushing's Syndrome
Conn's Syndrome
Primary bilateral Adrenocortial Neoplasms
Diffuse lymphoma or metastatic disease
Patient presents to her primary care provider with non-specific abdominal and pelvic complaints for the last several months.  No fever.
This case represents an uncommon diagnosis in an adult with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia.  In most circumstances, Cushings would be far more likely.  In this case, the imaging, physical exam and labs corroborate perfectly with the diagnosis.
