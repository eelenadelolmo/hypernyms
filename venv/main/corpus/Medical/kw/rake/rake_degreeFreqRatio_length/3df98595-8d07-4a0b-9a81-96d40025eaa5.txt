Eyes: there was papilloedema
Neurologic: bilateral sixth nerve palsy, bilateral cerebellar signs, and quadriparesis
patient undergone total excision of the posterior fossa mass.
biopsy of spinal lesion was taken and subsequent radiothereapy was given.
• Central posterior fossa mass
• Diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement of the spinal cord
Medulloblastoma with continuous spinal drop metastasis
Ependymoma
Pinealoma
Glioblastoma
A 20 year-old woman presents with a history of insidious onset of progressive headache, blurring of vision, and vomiting for 3 months duration.  She also reports progressive weakness of all four limbs for 2 months duration.
Drop metastasis are a well known phenomenon in medulloblastoma and screening of the spine with Gd-enhanced MR is essential.  Most often, spinal CSF seeding produces scattered nodular "drop mets".  It is very rare to see continuous sheeting of spinal drop metastasis on imaging - the so-called "zuckerguss" or "sugar-icing" appearance.  Because of this rarity this image is presented here.
