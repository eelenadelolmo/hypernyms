Physical exam demonstrates an enlarged right testicle.  Laboratory values were normal, including AFP and B-HCG.
The patient underwent an uneventful orchiectomy.  Pathology indicated a classic seminoma.  The patient did not display abnormal lab values (AFP and B-HCG) prior to surgery, and his values were normal at the one month post-op exam.  There was no indication of metastatic disease.
Transverse and longitudinal ultrasound images of the right testis demonstrate a diffuse enlargement with  heterogeneous echogenicity.  Color doppler images demonstrate an increase in vascularity when compared to the contralateral testis (contralateral side not shown).
Seminoma - Diagnosis confirmed by pathology following orchiectomy.
Seminoma
Mixed tumor
Embryonal carcinoma
Teratoma
26 year-old male presents with right testicular mass.
Seminomas are among the most common testicular tumors.  This case is somewhat atypical, as most seminomas display a relatively homogeneous, hypoechoic echogenicity.  This patient displays a heterogeneous echogenicity in the diseased testis.  Fortunately, seminomas are very radiosensitive and enjoy a favorable prognosis when compared to most other testicular neoplasms.
