Physical therapy and chiropractic therapy indefinitely as long as patient is getting symptomatic relief. Follow up with primary care physician in 3-4 months after initiation of therapy; sooner if symptoms significantly worsen. NSAIDS or Acetominophen should be taken for symptomatic relief. If symptoms persist without improvement beyond 3-4 months, or if they worsen, consider prescribing more aggressive medication such as opiates for pain relief and antispasmodics if patient experiences muscle spasms. Surgery is not indicated at this time.
XRAY LUMBOSACRAL SPINE 

CLINICAL INDICATION:  Low back pain due to injury during MVA.

AP and lateral radiographs of the lumbosacral spine show no fractures or dislocations.  Minimal anterior spurring at the L5-S1 disc level is seen.  Disc spaces are relatively preserved.  Minimal anterior spurring at the L2-3 disc level is also noted.  Mild straightening of upper lumbar lordosis is seen.  The vertebral heights are maintained.  The pedicles are intact.  No spondylolysis is seen.  The sacrum and sacroiliac joints are within normal limits.  Changes of abdominal wall hernia repair are noted.

IMPRESSION:
1.	NO EVIDENCE FOR FRACTURE OR ACUTE BONE ABNORMALITIES.
2.	MINIMAL DEGENERATIVE ANTERIOR SPURRING AT THE L2-3 AND L5-S1 DISC LEVELS.  


MRI LUMBAR SPINE 

CLINICAL INDICATIONS: Low back pain due to injury during MVA.  Lower extremity pain, numbness and weakness.  Evaluate for disc herniation. 

IMAGING SEQUENCES:  Sagittal T1 weighted, T2 weighted and STIR MRI of the lumbosacral spine was performed. Stacked angled axial T2 weighted images were obtained at the disc space levels from T12-L1 to L5-S1.  

FINDINGS: No fractures or dislocations are seen.  No destructive bony changes are seen.  The vertebral bodies are maintained in height.  The pedicles are intact.  No spondylolysis is seen.  The conus medullaris is unremarkable.  There is mild straightening of lumbar lordosis likely due to muscle spasm. 

At the T11-12, T12-L1, L1-2, L2-3 and L3-4 disc levels, no disc herniation, central or foraminal stenoses are seen.  

L4-5:  Small central posterior annular tear with minimal subligamentous protrusion minimally effacing the anterior epidural fat with associated mild disc desiccation.  No central or foraminal stenosis are seen.  

L5-S1:  5.5 mm far left posterior herniation of the extrusion type effaces the traversing left S1 nerve root with associated minimal left posterior ridging.  There is associated left foraminal herniation encroaching on and narrowing the left neural foramen effacing the exiting left L5 nerve root.  The right neural foramen is patent. 

IMPRESSION: 

1.	MILD STRAIGHTENING OF LUMBAR LORDOSIS LIKELY DUE TO MUSCLE SPASM. 
2.	5 MM LEFT POSTERIOR HERNIATION AT THE L5-S1 DISC LEVEL EFFACING THE TRAVERSING LEFT S1 NERVE ROOT AND EXTENDING INTO THE LEFT NEURAL FORAMEN RESULTING IN LEFT FORAMINAL STENOSIS AND EFFACEMENT OF THE EXITING LEFT L5 NERVE ROOT.

6.	IF FURTHER EVALUATION OF RADICULAR SYMPTOMS OR FORAMINAL PATHOLOGY IS REQUIRED CORRELATION WITH EMG AND/OR NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES WOULD BE HELPFUL.
Bilateral clinical lumbosacral radiculopathy secondary to disc herniation at L4/L5  and at L5/S.  EMG supported L5 and S1 radiculopathy left side.  Mechanical Back pain.
Given that the patient was involved in an MVA we must consider traumatic injury to the spine and lower back musculature. This can include vertebral body fracture, contusion, spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, and muscle sprains. 

Given the patients age there my be underlying elements of spondylosis, spondylolisthesis, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, and/or lumbosacral disc herniation.
The patient was the belted driver of a moving vehicle that was impacted on the passenger side in a T-bone fashion by another vehicle. She reports that on impact she was slammed forward and into the driver side door. She reports getting out of the vehicle after the impact and, feeling somewhat dazed, she “walked aimlessly” around the car for a brief period of time before returning to her car. Immediately following the accident, she reports having tremors on the right side of her body, pain and a burning sensation in the neck and right shoulder as well as pain in the right and left lower back and hips. In addition, she reports nausea and headache immediately following. She denies any loss of blood, loss of consciousness, or vomiting at the time of the accident. She was taken by EMS to a nearby ED where CT scan of the head and plain film radiographs of neck, shoulders, and chest were performed and concluded to be negative for acute bleeds, fractures, or other pathology. Ibuprofen and Lortab were prescribed and the patient was discharged to the care of her PCP with a diagnosis of “sprained neck”. 
Presently, the patient complains of pain in her neck, shoulders bilaterally, left lower back pain that wraps around to right and radiates down the back of the right leg distally to the right knee. Lower back and leg pain is worsened by prolonged standing/walking and minimally improved with sitting/lying down. The patient takes Flexeril, Lortab, and Tylenol irregularly for symptom relief, with minimal improvement with her pain and function.

This patient was diagnosed with lumbosacral radiculopathy secondary to disc herniations at L4/5 and L5/S1. Diagnosis was made with the combination of history, physical exam, MRI and EMG. Although her symptoms were classic for disc herniation, they can often times be seen in other spine pathologies such as degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine, or more generally referred to as lumbar spondylosis. As such, lumbosacral disc herniation and lumbar spondylosis can often mimic each other in their presentation and warrant the following discussion.

Definitions
Spondylosis is a broad term meaning degeneration of the spinal column from any cause. However, more specifically, it refers to disc degeneration with anterior spur formation of the spine. Spinal osteoarthritis, the most common cause of spondylosis, is defined as the age-related degradation of the cartilage of the joints in the spine- commonly the facet joints and intervertebral discs.  This process of cartilaginous degeneration produces secondary effects, chiefly in the vertebral bodies, the neural foramina, and the facet joints. This process occurs over a period of many years and, as the degeneration worsens, so does the degree of abnormal loading and biomechanics of the spine. These abnormalities in function are responsible for many of the common features seen in spondylosis. For example, osteophytes on the vertebral body may form. Osteophytes are bony overgrowths that form due to the stripping of the periosteum from the vertebral body in response to years of abnormal loading and biomechanics of the spine. Symptoms are produced when the neural foramen becomes stenosed by the encroaching osteophytes. Another feature commonly seen in spondylosis is facet joint dysfunction and hypertrophy. These features are described in more detail below [1,2].
Lumbosacral disc herniation occurs when the structural integrity of the annulus fibrosis is weakened causing the nucleus pulposus to bulge outward. This bulging usually occurs posteriorly as opposed to anteriorly, resulting in compression of the spinal cord, or narrowing of the neural foramen causing impingement of the exiting nerve root associated with that foramen. This process is the most common cause of lumbosacral radiculopathy [3]. 
The most common anatomical location of disc herniations are as follows [4]:
•	Posterolateral herniation: Most common location of herniation and usually compresses next lower nerve (e.g. L5/S1 herniation compresses S1 nerve root)
•	Posteromedial
•	Central (posterior) herniation: Less common. If at L1/L2, may compress spinal cord itself, potentially resulting in cauda equina syndrome. If at lower lumbar segments, commonly affects S1 nerve root
•	Lateral (foraminal) herniation
Classification of disc herniation types in sequential order of severity [4]:
•	Protrusion (“disc bulge”): bulge in disc, but not complete tear of annulus. Nucleus remains within the outermost fibers of annulus
•	Prolapse: nucleus material has penetrated the annulus, but is contain in front of the posterior longitudinal ligament
•	Extrusion: a small hole in the annulus and n. pulposus material moves into epidural space
•	Sequestration: disc fragments form outside of disc

Clinical Manifestations
•	Lumbar spondylosis:  Patients may have pain within the axial spine.  They may have neurologic claudication, which includes: lower back pain, leg pain, numbness when standing and walking. These symptoms improve in sitting and supine positioning. These symptoms may vary temporally in intensity and tend to intensify in the presence of other pathologies such as: spinal stenosis, disk herniation, bulging of the ligamentum flavum, spondylolisthesis. Additionally, patients frequently have joint stiffness and limited range of motion in the lumbar spine. These symptoms are typically worse in the morning and with activity.  [5,6]
•	Lumbosacral Disc Herniation: Patients may complain of numbness, tingling, pain, muscle weakness, paralysis, decreased reflexes within the dermatomal distribution of the affected nerve root. The pain is usually continuous, or at least continuous while in a specific body position vs muscle pain/spasm which may be pulsatile and may wax and wane over time. A large, central rupture may cause compression of cauda equina or spinal cord if at or above L1/L2. In the setting of acute herniation, the typical patient is an adult age 20-45. Acute herniation may occur at any age, but uncommon in the very old and young. Typically, lower back pain occurs when patient is lifting or standing up from a stooped position, or lifting while twisting (e.g. shoveling snow).  Either then, or 1-2 days later, pain migrates to buttock and lower limb. Later, paresthesia or numbness in leg or foot, sometimes accompanied by muscle weakness. The patient usually stands with a lateral list to one side and may intentionally maintain flexion in the knee on the affected side in an effort to reduce radicular pain [7].

Pathophysiology
•	Lumbar Spondylosis: In response to degenerative changes in the spinal column over many years, the spine progressively experiences abnormal loading pressures and mechanical forces. This process causes the bones within the vertebral column to respond in order to compensate. Typically, bone responds to these abnormal forces with hypertrophy. However, the hypertrophic response is also abnormal, and pathologic in nature. This ultimately results in changes in the vertebral column that are collectively referred to as spondylosis. Spondylosis not only involves excessive growth of bone, but also reactive osteoarthritis. Excessive growth of the bones results in narrowing of the intervertebral spaces, producing symptoms by compressing nerves that emerge from the spinal cord.  These symptoms are then amplified when arthritic bone growth further narrows the spinal canal. If severe enough, the intervertebral joints may actually fuse together as a result of the replacement of ligaments that connect the vertebrae with bone.  Similarly, fusion can also occur if osteophytes become large enough that they fuse adjacent vertebra together [8,9].
•	Disc Herniation: The intervertebral disc is a dynamic biologic structure. Just like any other tissue in the body, it undergoes changes as the body ages such as changes in the cellular/molecular structure and in its vascularity. These changes ultimately result in degeneration in the integrity of the intervertebral disc, reducing its ability to withstand physiologic loading. These degenerative changes can lead to a weakening, or tearing of the annulus fibrosis, leading to disc herniation. It has been demonstrated that disc degeneration commonly begins in early adulthood and that this may directly predispose the disc to herniation [10]. 

Risk Factors
•	Lumbar Spondylosis: The degenerative process that leads to lumbar spondylosis can begin as young as the age of 20 and since it progresses as we age, the prevalence increases with age. Most studies report little to no relation to physical activity level, height, weight, BMI, cigarette and alcohol use. The effects of heavy physical activity such as in athletes or repetitive and strenuous work environment for example are controversial [11].
•	Lumbosacral Disc Herniation:  Sedentary lifestyle is a major risk factor because the paraspinal (“stabilizing/support”) muscles become weakened, placing more strain on the spinal column thus increasing and altering loading biomechanics on the discs. Other risk factors include repetitive mechanical activities such as frequent bending/twisting/lifting, traumatic injury to the lumbar spine, obesity, poor posture. Tobacco use has been shown to contribute to disc degeneration because chemicals in tobacco lead to disc desiccation and this can predispose a person to herniation. Lastly, genetics has been demonstrated to play a role as mutations in proteins that regulate extracellular matrix (e.g. MMP2, THBS2) have been demonstrated to contribute to disc herniation.

Radiology
•	Lumbar Spondylosis: Both Xray and MRI can be helpful in the diagnosis of spondylosis. Common features include decreased intervertebral height, endplate sclerosis, osteophyte formation, and facet joint arthropathy findings. The classic radiographic hallmarks of facet joint arthropathy involve both degenerative and proliferative features, including narrowing of the facet joint space, subarticular bone erosions, subchondral cysts, osteophyte formation, and hypertrophy of the articular process [12].
•	Lumbosacral Disc Herniation:  History and physical exam are usually adequate to establish the diagnosis of disc herniation. However, imaging can be helpful if other etiologies for the patients presentation are suspected, or if there are significant neural deficits. Of all the imaging modalities, MRI is the gold standard to diagnosis and characterize disc herniation. MRI is more informative than CT and Xray because it can also identify other intraspinal pathologies, including inflammatory, malignant, and vascular disorders. In addition, MRI is not associated with ionizing radiation. Although rarely indicated, CT myelography can visualize spinal nerve roots and their trajectory through the neural foramina. It is useful for patients with intolerance of or contraindications to MRI, or when standard CT fails to define the anatomic correlates of the clinical presentation. In addition, CT myelography is preferred for patients who have surgically placed spinal hardware that produces magnetic artifacts [13,14,15,16].

Treatment
The treatment for both lumbar spondylosis and lumbosacral disc herniation are very similar. Treatment can generally be broken up into two categories. 1st line treatment is conservative. When conservative treatment fails to provide symptomatic relief and functional improvement, more aggressive treatment modalities can be explored. Treatment options are as follows: [17,18,19]
•	1st line: conservative
o	Short-term treatment with either an NSAID or acetaminophen
o	Consider NSAIDS first for their anti-inflammatory properties
o	Physical therapy and chiropractic care are an extremely important treatment modality for these patients both in the subacute and chronic setting. It should be noted that they are not recommended in the initial 1-2 weeks of acute disc herniation. This is because it is important to allow the inflammation associated with acute herniation to subside, and people with mild symptoms are likely to improve on their own while patients with very severe symptoms cannot participate in exercise therapy.  It is important to utilize chiropractic technique to traction/decompress the area of radiculopathy utilizing cumulative information from the radiographs, radiographic stress studies, MRI evaluation, EMG results and clinical findings to develop the best chiropractic approach to this patient.  
•	2nd line: consider more aggressive treatment if conservative treatment fails, or if neurological deficits and/or pain are severe
o	Opiates- a matter of clinical judgment. Reserve for patients with severe pain that is inadequately controlled with nonnarcotic analgesics. Opiates are to be used on a fixed schedule and only for a limited period of time. 
o	Antispasmotic agents- efficacy is debatable. These are unlikely to improve symptoms. However, may be useful for muscle spasms secondary to herniation and/or spondylosis. It is important to use these agents with caution if they are combined with opiates due to additive sedating effects.
o	Systemic glucocorticoids- studies have shown to be beneficial during the acute period of herniation, but only minimally so. Since spondylosis is a long-term chronic condition, systemic glucocorticoids are not recommended. However, in the acute setting, for an acute disc herniation for example, they are generally safe. The physician must be mindful to consider patient contraindications (HTN, diabetes, mood d/o, GI ulcers, osteoporosis, infections, etc..)  and the weigh risks vs benefits.
o	Epidural glucocorticoids- studies show modest, transient benefit, but are of no benefit beyond 3 months in disc herniation. For treatment of spondylosis, there is poor evidence for their effectiveness (improvement in short-term and long-term benefits).
o	Surgery- reserved for pts with severe and disabling symptoms that are refractory to other treatment options. It is important that a patient try more conservative treatment modalities first. One exception is cauda equina syndrome which necessitates surgery within 24 hours, ideally within 12 hours of symptom onset.
