Confirmation of a benign gastric ulcer in the body of the stomach by direct endoscopic visualization and biopsy
Under fluoroscopic guidance an air contrast upper GI series was performed.  A small ulcer is detected in the body of the stomach with smooth radial folds.  This ulcer is highly suspicious of a benign gastric ulcer. The pylorus, duodenal bulb and sweep (not shown) all appear unremarkable

50 y.o. woman with no past medical history complains of burning epigastric pain for the last month - usually one to two hours after eating a meal. 
Occasional nausea and vomiting with the pain; and, symptoms have increased in frequency over the last two weeks. She has had some relief with over the counter antacids - but felt it was time to see a doctor who prescribed Prilosec and told her to schedule an air-contrast upper GI study.
Patient denies any alcohol but has smoked a pack a day for the last 30 years
