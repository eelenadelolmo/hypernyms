Multiple sub-centimeter enhancing nodular lesions of the thoracic spinal cord and conus medullaris.  Lesions are isointense on T2WI.
Spinal metastases
Cerebral glioblastoma, ependymoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and posterior fossa medulloblastoma are the most common CNS primary tumors that metastasize to the spinal subarachnoid space.  Non-CNS tumors that commonly seed the subarachnoid space include carcinoma of the lung or breast, melanoma, lymphoma, and leukemia.
63 yo asymptomatic man presents for annual spine screening.  Patient reports a history of a spinal cord tumor removed “4 or 5 years ago,” though he doesn’t recall the type of tumor and was treated only with surgery.
These findings are most likely secondary to the original, unknown tumor.  Given the focal nature of the original tumor, along with the patient's prolonged course (a 2002 spinal MRI was negative for mets) and radiographic findings, ependymoma is considered most likely.
