No complaints and no laboratory abnormalities.
No specific treatment was undertaken, as the patient was asymptomatic and this was considered an incidental finding.
Small focal area of thickening in the non-dependent portion of the gallbladder wall with a bright echogenic focus and a distal comet-tail artifact.
Adenomyomatosis
FOCAL GALLBLADDER WALL THICKENING:

•Benign conditions
»Adenomyomatosis
»Polyps
»Other benign tumors (adenoma, cystadenoma)

•Malignancy
»Gallbladder adenocarcinoma
»cholangiocarcinoma
»hepatocellular carcinoma
»metastatic cancer
61 yo African American male presenting for follow-up evaluation of portal hypertension.
Comet tail artifact is caused by reverberation of the ultrasound beam off cholesterol crystals trapped within Rokitansky-Aschoff sinused in the gallbladder wall.  It is highly specfic for adenomyomatosis and confirmed the diagnosis in this case.
