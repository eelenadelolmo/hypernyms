Tenderness was present over the neck.  The patient was holding his head straight.
Blood parameters were normal.
Under local anesthesia oesophagoscopy was done.  Foreign body (denture) was removed.
Soft tissue lateral neck:
1. Prevertebral shadow widening extending from C3 to C6 vertebrae.  Prevertebral shadow widening is identified when the prevertebral soft tissue widening is more than 1/2 the thickness of the corresponding vertebra.
2. Radio opaque foreign body was seen at the same level, possibly the hooks of a denture.
Foreign body (Denture) at the level of cricopharynx
60 y.o. with dysphagia.  He was unable to swallow even saliva  because of excessive pain.
Foreign body ingestion is common in children.  In this case this patient under the influence of alcohol had ingested his own denture.  Dentures are more prone to cause complications during removal.  Their metal hooks may traumatize the mucosa of the cricopharynx / oesophagus.  If oesophageal mucosa is traumatized it could lead to fatal mediastinitis.  After removal of a foreign body, a Ryles tube must be introduced, and feeding should be through the tube till esophageal injury heals.  The patient must be kept under observation at least for three days.  Mediastinitis can be identified by the presence of shoulder pain in the patient.  Chest radiographs should also be taken during the immediate post operative period to rule out acute oesophageal tears and extraluminal air.
