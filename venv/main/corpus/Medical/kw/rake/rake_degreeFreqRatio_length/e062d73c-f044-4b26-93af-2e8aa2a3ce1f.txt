Non-contributory
None required.
Axial and coronal images of abdominal and chest CT significant for absence of IVC below liver. Enlarged azygous/hemiazygous systems present. Drainage from right renal vein into azygous vein and left renal vein into hemiazygous vein. Hemiazygous vein drains into azygous vein near level of diaphragm. Lateral Chest radiograph shows absence of IVC.
Absence of IVC
Normal anatomic variant.
64 y.o. man with a Hx of HTN, HLD, DM2, CAD, with recent intermittent angina. Angioplasty 3 days ago showed 60% obstruction of left main coronary artery. Pt scheduled in 1 week for for 2 vessel CABG,  LIMA to LAD and SVG to Ramus Intermedius.
PATIENT WAS ASYMPTOMATIC AND THIS FINDING WAS INCIDENTAL. OTHER SIMILAR CASES OF INTERRUPTED IVC SUGGEST THAT THE WELL-DEVELOPED AZYGOUS SYSTEM IS MORE OFTEN FOUND IN PATIENTS THAT ARE ASYMPTOMATIC WHILE WHEN POORLY DEVELOPED, PATIENTS MORE OFTEN PRESENT WITH SYMPTOMS SUCH AS DVT, LEG SWELLING, AND LEG PAIN. 

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THIS PATIENT INCLUDE IVC FILTER PLACEMENT AND PLACEMENT OF PERIPHERAL LINES SUCH AS FEMORAL VENOUS ACCESS WHICH MAY REQUIRE VENOGRAM PRIOR TO PLACEMENT
