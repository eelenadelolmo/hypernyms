Texto: 
VSS, afebrile.  
Minimal tenderness to palpation in back and leg.  
Right Patellar Reflex diminished relative to Left side.  
All other reflexes equal bilaterally.  
No decreased ROM.  
Weakness on inversion of R foot.  
CBC, CMP, ESR, CRP all normal.
Surgical Resection with return of full function.
Low T1 signal round lesion adjacent to the postero-lateral aspect of the thecal sac.
Rim is iso-signal on T1 and low signal on T2. 
Bright on T2-weighted images.
Communication with the facet joint. 
Heterogeneity of cyst likely due to proteinaceous fluid or hemorrhage within the cyst.
Synovial Cyst
extruded disk fragments
ganglion cysts
nerve sheath tumors
septic facet arthritis
asymmetric ligamentum flavum hypertrophy
synovial cyst
6 months of continuous, worsening back pain
Radiates to Right KNEE and down to Right MEDIAL ANKLE
‚ÄúKnee and ankle feel funny sometimes when I walk‚Äù
Pain is not affected by time of day or activity
Denies Hx of Trauma
Pain is minimally improved by stretching and OTC pain meds
Conservative Management is more common as the cyst may spontaneously regress. Additional conservative treatments include facet injection with steroids and percutaneous aspiration of the cyst material under CT guidance.
