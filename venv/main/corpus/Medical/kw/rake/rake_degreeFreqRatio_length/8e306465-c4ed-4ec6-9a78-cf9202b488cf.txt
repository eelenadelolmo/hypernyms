*Markedly ataxic gait.  
*Abnormal Mini-Mental Status Exam score of 22/30.
The patient underwent CSF shunting, which resulted in a mild improvement in symptoms.
Axial CT images through the brain show communicating hydrocephalus, with dilatation of the third ventricle and lateral ventricles in the absence of significant co-existent sulcal enlargement.  Also noted were prominent temporal horns (not shown).
Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH)
A normal opening pressure at lumbar puncture, in combination with the previously described imaging findings, confirmed the diagnosis of Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus.
A 76-year-old African American male with end stage renal disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism, now presenting with a 2-3 month history of mental status changes, ataxia, and urinary incontinence.
