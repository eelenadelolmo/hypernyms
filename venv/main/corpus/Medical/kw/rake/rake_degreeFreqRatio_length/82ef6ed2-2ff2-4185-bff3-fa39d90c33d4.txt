Texto: 
Decreased O2 saturation
Increased respiratory rate
Chest Wall: Left Breast reconstruction with saline implant
Pulmonary Signs on CT:
Filling defects in pulmonary vessels
Cardiac Signs on CT:
Septal bowing (predictor of short term death)
RV dilation
Increased ratio of Pulmonary Art: Aorta
Decrease in size of left atrium and pulmonary veins (decreased pulmonary venous return) 
Dilatation of IVC, hepatic veins, coronary sinus, azygous vein 
Increased ratio of Right to Left ventricle RV:LV
Pulmonary Embolism, Right Heart Strain
Pulmonary embolism
this 76 y.o. woman, s/p abdominal surgery, now has sudden onset of chest pain and SOB. with decreased O2 saturation of 76% on room air
