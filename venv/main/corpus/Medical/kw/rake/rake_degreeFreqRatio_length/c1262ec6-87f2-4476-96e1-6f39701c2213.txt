On physical exam, patient has marked inspiratory stridor, with resultant prolonged inspiratory phase.  His voice is very soft, and markedly hoarse.  Lung fields are clear to auscultation bilaterally aside from referred upper airway stridor.
Patient received a tracheostomy for airway protection.  He will likely undergo more extensive surgical resection and neck dissection.  He will also likely receive radiation therapy.
Within the subglottic region there is an ill-defined and heterogeneous mass with postcontrast enhancement that measures 5.1 cm (CC) x
3.0 cm (AP) x 2.4 cm (trans) mass.  This is within the tracheal lumen and is precluding the airway.  In addition, this is compressing the upper esophagus.  There is no evidence of bony erosion at the adjacent hyoid bone.  There is no evidence of additional mass lesions within the nasal or oral pharynx. There is no evidence of lesions within the distal trachea or mainstem bronchi.  A tracheostomy tube is seen that enters the trachea just distal to this mass lesion.  There is no evidence of adenopathy.
Laryngeal Papillomatosis with malignant transformation
Differential considerations include respiratory papillomatosis given the patient's history.  Primary malignancy cannot be entirely excluded on this study, though there is no evidence of local invasion or adenopathy.
This 51yo man has a history of progressive recurrent stridor and hoarseness.  He has been admitted multiple times for respiratory distress.  He has known laryngeal papillomatosis with +HPV.
