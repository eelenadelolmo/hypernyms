Urinalysis demonstrated 4+ blood.
Large heterogeneous enhancing mass arising from the right kidney.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
This large enhancing heterogeneous mass is virtually pathognomonic for renal cell carcinoma.  Renal lymphoma is frequently infiltrative and if solid, usually hypoenhancing when compared to the normal renal parenchyma.  Renal metastases are usually small and multifocal.  Oncocytomas are relatively uncommon, large, homogeneous masses frequently with a central fibrous scar in asymptomatic patients.
66 yo female with painless hematuria.
