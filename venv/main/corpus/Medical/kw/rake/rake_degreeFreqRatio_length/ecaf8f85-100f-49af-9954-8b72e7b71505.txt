>>Physical exam within normal limits. No evidence of sonographic Murphy's sign.

>>Normal liver function tests.
Treatment is generally conservative, if the patient is symptomatic.
>>Intramural cystic formation (anechoic diverticula) with echogenic foci 
>>Comet-tail/ring-down reverberation artifacts together 
with segmental/partial thickening of the gallbladder wall are considered to be the diagnostic findings on US examination.

Comet tail artifacts are generally V-shaped and short.
