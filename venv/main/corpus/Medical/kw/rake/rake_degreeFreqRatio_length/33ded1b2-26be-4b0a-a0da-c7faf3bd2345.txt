Weight is 38.8 kg, pulse 85,
blood pressure 134/64. Head circumference 55 cm. She is bright, awake, alert, pleasant with fluent speech. Her head is normocephalic. 
On physical examination, she has relatively good range of motion at both the hips. I was able to flex well past 90. There is no tenderness to palpation about the lumbar spine.
Treatment: 
1)	Supportive including Physical Therapy in milder cases
2)	Surgical includes amputation, contracture treatment 

Follow up:
Lifetime follow-up is necessary especially during the first 3 years after diagnosis.

Image 3: T1 MRI also showing the hip narrowing.

Caudal Regression Syndrome
• Sirenomelia 
• Neural tube defect 
• Segmental spinal agenesis 
• VACTERL
This 15 y.o. girl presented with a history of chronic back pain with no relief. She tried some NSAIDs which did not seem to help with the pain. She was later prescribed Vicodin and Lidocaine patches which seemed to mitigate the pain.
This 15 year old patient had some noteworthy complications. Firstly, she had a neurogenic bladder that was repaired with a vesicostomy. Secondly, she had a meningomyelocele that was also repaired. These are two possible complications that must be accounted for in caudal regression syndrome.
