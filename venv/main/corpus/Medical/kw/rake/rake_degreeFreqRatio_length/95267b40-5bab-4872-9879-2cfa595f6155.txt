Supportive
• CT: Subtle hypodensity in corpus callosum. 
• MR Diffusion: This lesion is much better evaluated on the diffusion weighted MR images, where it is bright on DWI and dark on ADC suggesting cytotoxic edema.  
• MR T2 and FLAIR:  Bright lesion on these images, but less so than the DWI.
Diffuse Axonal Injury
• Diffuse axonal injury
• Demyelinating process
• Lymphoma (would expect enhancment)
• Transient lesion in splenium in an epileptic patient
25 year old man with closed head trauma after  blast.
There is a subtle hypodensity on the CT images in the corpus callosum that corresponds to the high signal on the DWI images.  This is infrequently seen.
