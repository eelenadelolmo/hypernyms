Texto: 
Nodular masses along hemodialysis graft.
Patient was treated with an covered endovascular stents.
Sonographic images of the hemodialysis graft demonstrate two Pseudoaneurysms 4 cm apart with turbulence and the classic Yin and Yang appearance of the internal flow on both gray scale and color flow Doppler.

Digital subtraction images demonstrate outpouching of contrast demonstrated along the course of the graft. Post endovascular stent placement demonstrates normal caliber and flow of the hemodialysis graft and the Pseudoaneurysms are no longer visualized.
Pseudoaneurysm of Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Hemodialysis graft.
Pseudoaneuyrm of the hemodialysis graft
End-stage renal disease with history of hemodialysis catheter.
This patient was on anticoagulant therapy and the likely etiology for the Pseudoaneurysm formation was the insufficient compression from needle removal from the puncture site.  After treatment with endovascular stents the pseudoaneuryms were no longer apparent.
