Temperature: 99.4 F.  Tenderness to palpation over the right lower quadrant.  Positive guarding and rebound.
Surgical removal of the appendix.  Patients generally do well and are often discharged from the hospital after 24 to 48 hours.
Ultrasonic images using linear and curvilinear transducers over the right lower quadrant at the point of maximal tenderness demonstrates an immobile, noncompressible, blind ending tubular structure.  The appendix measures up to 1.1 cm and demonstrates a 7 mm round hyperechoic structure intraluminally.
