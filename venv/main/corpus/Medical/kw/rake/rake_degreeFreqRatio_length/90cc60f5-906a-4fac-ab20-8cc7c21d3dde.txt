There is a long segment of increase muscular thickness with coaptation of the lumen of the  pylorus.  The length of the pyloric canal is 1.5 cm.  This is greater than the 1.2cm normal length.  The muscle thickness is .46cm which exceeds the greater than or equal to 3mm thickness of normal.  During the study40 cc of water was instilled into the stomach, and no fluid was seen to pass through the pylorus.
