Asymptomatic cysts can be followed, although no consensus on interval or length of follow up has been determined.  Occasional complications include cyst rupture, erosion into adjacent structure and cardiac tamponade.  Treatment of symptomatic cysts include open resection, minimally invasive thorascopic resection or percutaneous ablation.

Frontal view of the chest demonstrates a well circumscribed, round opacity in the right cardiophrenic angle.

Noncontrast CT of the chest shows a fluid density cystic structure located in the right anterior cardiophrenic angle.

Cardiac MR demonstrates three small, well defined cystic structures with high signal intensity on T2 and low signal intensity on T1 consistent with fluid.  The cysts are located in the right cardiophrenic angle and abut the pericardium, consistent with pericardial cyst.
