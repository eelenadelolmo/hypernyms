She was not felt to be a candidate for thrombolytic therapy and treatment was conservative.
Image 1, is a non-contrast CT obtained immediately following her altered mental status on hospital day 3. It reveals hypodensities in the cortical and subjacent white matter regions of the left MCA and left PCA. These findings had been present on HD1 and were felt to represent subacute embolic strokes from cardiac emboli due to a lapse of anticoagulant therapy for her chronic A-fib. 
Image 2, a diffusion weighted MRI, is obtained shortly after the CT in image 1. It reveals the subacute L MCA stroke, but also reveals an extensive acute R MCA stroke which is not evident on the CT image. This additional stroke is responsible for her acute mental status decline on HD3.
Thromboembolic Stroke
Embolic Infarction
Thrombotic Infarction
Vasculitic Infarction
The patient is a resident of an assisted living center who presents to the ED with "global aphasia" of unspecified duration. She has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation and a recent interruption of her prophylactic anticoagulant therapy.  A CT scan is obtained which reveals subacute L MCA and L PCA strokes, felt to be secondary to left atrial emboli. She is admitted for supportive treatment. Two days later, during her inpatient stay, she is discovered unresponsive with intact pupils.  A repeat CT scan and MRI are immediately obtained.
Diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) scans are more sensitive for the detection of the acute phase of stroke than CT scans. DWI reveals diffusion restricted regions of cytotoxic edema as hyperintense signal.
