Complete occlusion of the right lateral sinus and jugular vein.  Partial occlusion by thrombus of the superior sagital sinus, straight sinus, and vein of Galen.  Mild edema in the right cerebral hemisphere, including the right frontal lobe. Thrombosis of multiple cortical and deep veins.  Subtotal opacification of the right mastoid air cells.
