Texto: 
Anisocoria, right pupil larger than left, but reactive.  Otherwise normal exam.
Noncontrast CT:  Region of increased density adjacent to the frontal horn of the right lateral ventricle.  No edema or mass effect.

MR:  Well-circumscribed lesion in region adjacent to the frontal horn of the right lateral ventricle.  Centrally isointense on T1WI without enhancement post-gad.  Centrally hyperintense and peripherally hypointense on fse T2WI with "blooming" on GRE sequences due to susceptibility artifact from hemosiderin.
