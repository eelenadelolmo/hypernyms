None.
Ventilation and perfusion scanning demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary embolism.  The perfusion images (submitted) demonstrated abnormally located radiolabel activity inferior to the left lung.  Additional images with a larger field of view and blocked lung activity demonstrate radiotracer actuvuty in the stomach and thyroid, consistent with free Tc99m.
