Pain along proximal tibia.
Casting and immobilization.
Original radiographs demonstrate focal cortical  periosteal reaction in the posterior proximal tibial diaphysis.

Follow-up radiographs after symptom worsening demonstrate a complete fracture at the previous site of stress fracture. There is increased periosteal reaction with dense sclerotic fracture line through the entire tibial shaft.
