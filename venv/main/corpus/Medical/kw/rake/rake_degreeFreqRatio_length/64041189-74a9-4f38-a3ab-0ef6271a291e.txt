Patient alert and responsive to stimulus. Vital signs stable. Clear sclera with sun-set eyes. Grade II/VI murmur appreciated. Grossly macrocephalic with full fontanelles. Primitive reflexes intact. No seizure activity appreciated.
Ventriculoperitoneal shunt with imaging follow-up.
MR imaging of the brain w/o contrast reveals agenesis of the corpus callosum with a very large inter-hemispheric cyst and severe hydrocephalus.  There is a large posterior fossa cyst with rudimentary cerebellar hemispheres. The cerebellar vermis appears to be absent.  There is marked elevation of the tentorium and torcula. The lateral ventricles are dilated.  There is no acute hemorrhage.  The findings appear to be consistent with the diagnosis of severe Dandy-Walker malformation.
Dandy-Walker Malformation
• Dandy-Walker malformation
• Dandy-Walker variant
• Mega cisterna magna
• Arachnoid cyst.
A 1 day old baby girl twin delivered at 32 weeks gestation as a scheduled C-section.  Maternal 15 week U/S revealed prenatal diagnosis of severe Dandy Walker malformation.  Patient was born with obvious macrocephaly (Apgar 5,8) and is responsive and alert with no obvious physical deficits.  Brain MRI confirms diagnosis.
Diagnostic (MRI) evaluation of characteristic triad (Hart et. al, 1972) + hydrocephalus.
