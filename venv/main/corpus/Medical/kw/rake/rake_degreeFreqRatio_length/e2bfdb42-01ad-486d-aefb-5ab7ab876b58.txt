Sensory and motor deficiencies in both lower extremities.
INR: 3.7
Surgery was performed after the MRI confirmed the findings.  Following surgery he had minimal return of motor and sensory symptoms and is continuing in physical therapy.
MRI is the procedure of choice to evaluate any cord compression symptoms.  Findings include mass effect (whether extradural or intradural) on the spinal cord, cauda equina, or exiting spinal nerves.
epidural spinal hematoma
Epidural spinal hematoma
79 yo male post op day 3 from a AAA repair who is now complaining of inability to move legs.  The patient is being anticoagulated and has a epidural catheter for pain control.
This patient had a very high pretest probability of a positive exam.  He had recent surgery, an epidural catheter in place, and was being anticoagulated.  This is an unfortunate complication following surgery, but demonstrates the diagnostic power of MRI.  Furthermore, given the hyperintense signal on the T2 weighted images, this signifies an acute bleed.
