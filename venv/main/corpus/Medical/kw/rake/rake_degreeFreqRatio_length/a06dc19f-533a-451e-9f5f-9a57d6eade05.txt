Texto: 
Due to the patient’s complaints of abdominal discomfort and the presence of Cowden’s syndrome, the patient underwent an upper GI study that showed a filling defect at the gastroesophagial junction. An upper endoscopy showed a small polypoid lesion located at the gastroesophagial junction, which led to a polypectomy. The microscopic examination showed a large distorted and inflamed benign mucosal polyp with intestina metaplasia. The patient also underwent a small bowel endoscopy and colonoscopy that were unremarkable.
 Ultrasound of the thyroid gland was unremarkable except for a small 3mm hypoechoic nodule in the left thyroid lobe.
Polypectomy of the gastric polyp.
The patient underwent upper GI study, small bowel endoscopy, colonoscopy, repeated ultrasound of the thyroid gland, CT of the head, and MRI of the brain
Additional cancer screenings will be recommended when the patient gets older.
1.	Annual clinical breast examination and mammography beginning at age 25 years.
2.	Annual endometrial screening including transvaginal ultrasound and uterine biopsies beginning at age 30-35.
3.	Colorectal screenings in adulthood at an age and frequency determined by her doctors.
4.	Annual urinalysis to rule out renal cell carcinoma, in adulthood.
Mobile esophageal polyp at presentation.  Capsule endoscopy was suspicious for jejunal polyp, however push endoscopy found this to be the major and minor papilla.
Cowden's syndrome
Gardner syndrome
Peutz-Jeghers syndrome
Cronkhite-Canada syndrome
Multiple adenomatous polyps
A 15-year-old African-American female presented herself with complaints of stomach pain and dysphagia. The patient was otherwise healthy with no other complaints.
The patient's mother had previously been diagnosed with Cowden syndrome resulting from a known mutation in the PTEN gene in exon 1 R15S during which one adenine nucleobase is replaced by thymine changing the normal Argenine codon (AGA) to a Serine codon (AGT). The mother has a history of follicular thyroid cancer with recurrence, multiple benign gastric and colorectal polyps, uterine fibroids, and a breast ductal papilloma.
The patient had a 50% chance for the familial PTEN mutation based on her family history and her risk was much higher because she had some typical symptoms such as macrocephaly and plantar keratoses
Capsule endoscopy is often used to interogate distal small bowel, but it may have been nonspecific in this case. This patient will need surveilance for the development of more polyps.
