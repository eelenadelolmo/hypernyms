Tenderness over left flank with percussion
The patient was referred to urology for opinion on resection as the mass was large (>4cm), causing symptoms, and at risk for bleeding.
Renal ultrasound reveals a 5.6cm hyperechoic exophytic mass arising from the left kidney.  CT reveals that the mass has soft-tissue and macroscopic fatty components

Intermittent Left flank pain
A renal angiomyolipoma (AML) is a hamartomatous lesion that can contain fat, smooth muscle, and blood vessels.  While visibility of macroscopic fat is presumed diagnostic, lipid poor AMLs are well known and found on renal biopsy.  Multiple AMLs are associated with tuberous sclerosis.
