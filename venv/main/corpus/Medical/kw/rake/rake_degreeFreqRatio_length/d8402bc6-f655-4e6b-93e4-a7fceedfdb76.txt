Vitals: BP: 116/65 	
 Pulse: 90 	
 Temp:  36.4 Â°C (97.5 Â°F) 	
 Resp: 	24 	
 Weight: 31.55 kg 		
 SpO2: 98% 	

Constitutional: She appears well-developed and well-nourished. She is active. No distress. 
HENT: 
Head: Normocephalic and atraumatic. 
Right Ear: Tympanic membrane normal. 
Left Ear: Tympanic membrane normal. 
Mouth/Throat: Oropharynx is clear. 
PE present in R TM. 
Eyes: Conjunctivae and EOM are normal. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Right eye exhibits no discharge. Left eye exhibits no discharge. 
Neck: Normal range of motion. Neck supple. No rigidity or adenopathy. 
Cardiovascular: Normal rate and regular rhythm. Pulses are palpable. 
Pulmonary/Chest: Effort normal and breath sounds normal. No stridor. No respiratory distress. She has no wheezes. She has no rhonchi. She has no rales. 

Abdominal: Soft. Bowel sounds are normal. She exhibits no distension and no mass. There is no hepatosplenomegaly. There is no tenderness. There is no rebound and no guarding. No hernia. 
Negative heel tap 
Neurological: She is alert. 
Skin: Skin is warm and dry. Capillary refill takes less than 3 seconds. No rash noted. 

â€¢ECG:There is sinus arrhythmia with normal intervals and no hypertrophy.
Findings were incidental and after a complete cardiac workup no clinical manifestations of the anomaly were found. Patient was discharged with out cardiac medication or activity restriction. 

Aberrant Right Upper Lobe and Right Middle Lobe Veins. 

No follow up scheduled.
Chest Xray: The heart size is normal. No bony abnormalities are noted. There is a circular density of unknown etiology adjacent to the patient&#39;s right hilum. 

Chest CT: There is no evidence of an acute process or mass within the lung fields. The pulmonary venous drainage is a variant of normal with the right upper lobe and right middle lobe each having a separate vein draining appropriately to the left atrium. The right upper lobe pulmonary vein is long and tortuous and accounts for the abnormality identified on chest x-ray. The lungs are well aerated bilaterally with no cavitary lesion demonstrated. The patient has a congenital anomaly of the pulmonary venous drainage from the right upper lobe and right middle lobe with each lobe having a separate vein draining to the left atrium. The right upper lobe pulmonary vein is long and tortuous and accounts for the abnormality identified on chest radiography


ECHO: The intracardiac relationships are normal with normal chamber dimensions and wall thicknesses. Biventricular systolic function is normal. The atrial and ventricular septae are both intact. There is no evidence for valvular stenosis, prolapse or significant insufficiency. The great arteries are normally related. Normal coronary artery origins are noted. The aortic arch is left-sided without PDA or coarctation. There is no pericardial effusion.
Variant pulmonary venous anatomy (no clinical significance)
Structural Anomaly: AVM, Aberrant Vein, Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return
Pulmonary Infection: mycobacterium tuberculosis 
Granuloma
Neoplasm
This 7 year old girl presented to the Emergency Department with an acute onset cough and chest pain located in the lower left rib cage. She denied syncope or palpitations, and has no medical history besides two previous surgical procedures (tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy and removal of hordeolum).
