Microsurgical resection is the treatment of choice for symptomatic cavernoma.  If the lesion contains a component of developmental venous anomaly, venous drainage must be preserved at surgery.
• Well circumscribed, lobulated intra-axial lesion
• Mixed signal on T1 and T2 with fluid-fluid levels (popcorn ball lesion)
• T2 hypointense rim (hemosiderin)
• No associated edema
• Enhancing (atypical)
Cerebral Cavernous Malformation
• Cavernoma (cavernous malformation)
• mixed vascular anomaly
• hemorrhagic or calcified neoplasm

Cavernomas (also called cavernous malformations and cavernous angiomas) are immature vascular hamartomas.  Histologically, they are composed of a collection of relatively disorganized endothelial-lined spaces.  The most common symptomatic presentation is seizure, focal deficit, or headache.

On CT, cavernomas are typically hyperdense lesions which can calcify.  On MRI they are best seen on gradient echo sequences because of blooming artifact from prior hemorrhage.  The classic MRI description is the “popcorn ball” appearance on T2 with mixed intensity and fluid-fluid levels.  They have a circumferential rim of T2 hypointensity from hemosiderin deposition.  Unlike neoplastic processes with hemorrhage or calcifications, cavernomas are well circumscribed and should not create vasogenic edema.  Surrounding edema can be seen after hemorrhage, however.   If one cavernous malformation is identified, the study should be reviewed for others as 60-80% of cases have multiple lesions.

Cavernomas are often occult on classic angiography.  On CT and MRI, cavernomas typically enhance poorly.  If a cavernoma enhances avidly, as in this case, one has to question whether the lesion actually represents a mixed vascular lesion.  The study should be scrutinized for evidence of feeding veins to suggest a component of developmental venous anomaly, which changes surgical planning.  In this case, no further evidence of a mixed lesion was found.
