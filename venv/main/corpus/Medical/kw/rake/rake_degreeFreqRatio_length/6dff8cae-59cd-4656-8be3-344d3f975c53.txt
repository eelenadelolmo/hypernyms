Patient holding left arm with right hand.
Left shoulder hanging low.
Left arm neurovascularly intact.
A call was placed to the outside Acute Care Clinic where the patient received care.  In discussion with the provider who saw the patient, he diagnosed dislocation without viewing the imaging and successful relocated the patient's arm with resolution of pain and maintenance of sensation and blood flow.
1. Anterior and lateral dislocation of the left humeral head without evident fracture.

2. Prior glenoid labrum repair with 3 osseus anchors

Recurrent Shoulder Dislocation/Instability
22 year-old man presenting to acute care with pain in left shoulder after reaching out to catch a football.  He reports a history of 6 prior 'shoulder separations.'
The patient not only has an acute dislocation, but prior glenoid labrum repair is evidence of recurrent dislocations (instability).  The reported mechanism of injury also suggests instability.  The patient was referred to Orthopedics for further care and has not received additional imaging within our system.
