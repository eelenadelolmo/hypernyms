PE: Left hip is held flexed, abducted, externally rotated.
LABS: Normal CRP, ESR, WBC.
NSAIDs may shorten the duration of symptoms. 

Patients with TS usually experience marked improvement within 24-48 hours. Two thirds to three fourths of patients with TS have complete resolution within 2 weeks. The remainder may have less-severe symptoms for several weeks.

The recurrence rate is 4-17%; most recurrences develop within 6 months

If significant symptoms persist for 7-10 days after the initial presentation, consider other diagnoses. 

Advise that all patients with TS have repeat radiographs within 6 months to exclude LCP disease.
Ultrasound of the hips demonstrates a left-sided hip effusion measuring approximately  2.9 cm (CC) x 0.8 cm (TRV), asymmetric when compared to the right hip. The joint fluid demonstrates diffuse low level echoes.

1.  Septic Arthritis
2.  Transient Synovitis
3.  Juvenile RA
4.  Malignancy (Leukemia)
5.  Sickle Cell Anemia
