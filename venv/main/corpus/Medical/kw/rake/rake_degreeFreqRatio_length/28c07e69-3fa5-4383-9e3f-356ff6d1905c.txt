VSS: stable
Marked lordosis, no vertebral tenderness, no pulsatile abdominal masses, neuro. exam non focal
Patient was seen in the medicine clinic and a lumbar spine was ordered for a one month history of positional back pain.  The abdominal aortic aneurysm was an incidental finding.  Due to the size of the aneurysm, vascular surgery was consulted.  The aneurysm was determined to be well calcified and in no immediate danger of rupture.  The patient is scheduled for aortic endograft repair this month.  An endograft will be placed in the lumen of the aneurysm to exclude the aneurysm from flow through the aorta and reduce the risk of rupture.
L-spine: Lower lumbar hyperlordosis with marked degenerative changes involving multiple levels of the lower thoracic and lower lumbar spine.  6 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm with extensive aortoiliac calcification.
Abdominal CT: Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with a maximum AP dimension of 5.4 cm and transverse dimension of 4.9 cm.    The aneurysm is 1 cm below the left renal artery ostium and ends 3 cm above the aortic bifurcation.  There is extensive calcification in the aorta, SMA, bilateral renal arteries, iliac arteries, and common iliac arteries.  All the vessels are patent.

Other causes of back pain: musculoskeletal back pain, malignancy, vertebral infection, nephrolithiasis, herniated disc, degenerative disease
