Texto: 
Right breast mass at 3 o'clock position of the right breast.
Pt was referred back to  the primary provider, for eventual referral to plastic surgery for possible revision.
Ultrasound findings-  classic linguini sign consisting of hyperechoic linear objects coursing through the implant.  Hyperechoic shadowing of all structures, typical of silicon infiltrating into tissues surrounding the implant capsule.

MRI-  Linguini sign with high signal on h20 saturation in the soft tissue surrounding the implant.
Breast implant,  rupture, extracapsular silicone
silicone implant rupture
55 Y/O female with bilateral silicone iplants.  Has right breast mass to 3-4o'clock
The findings of this case are classic for bilateral implant rupture, with extravasation of silicone to the tissues adjacent to the capsule.  A silicone granuloma has formed.
