Mild weakness right leg
She initially had CT scan of her abdomen for pain.  A paraspinal mass was noted on that study, at T6-7, prompting the present exam - an MRI of T spine.

She then had surgical resection of the lesions, with spine fusion.
• Dumbbell-shaped mass at T6-7 with both intraspinal and paraspinal component.
• Mass compresses spinal cord.
• Mass is hyperintense on T2 sequences and enhances homogeneously.
Schwannoma Thoracic Spine
• Schwannoma
• Neurofibroma
• Meningioma
• Metastatic disease
