Bibasilar crackles
THIS CASE: Treated with corticosteroid therapy with improvement of symptoms and CT findings.

IN GENERAL:  Removal from antigen exposure +/- corticosteroid treatment.
CXR: bibasilar linear interstitial pattern

CT (PE study): diffuse ground glass greater at bases
Extrinsic allergic alveolitis (hypersensitivity pneumonitis)-acute
1)Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
2)Acute interstitial disease (DIP, AIP, viral)
3)Eosinophilic pneumonia
4)Pulmonary edema
34 y/o male with cough and dyspnea.  No specific exposures.
Chest x-ray findings:

Acute: diffuse micronodular interstitial pattern.  (+/- ground-glass density in the lower and middle lung zones).  Normal in 10%. 

Subacute: micronodular or reticular opacities are most prominent in mid-to-upper lung zones.

Chronic: progressive fibrotic changes with loss of lung volume particularly affect the upper lobes. Nodular or ground-glass opacities are not features. 
	
HRCT findings:

Acute: Ground-glass or diffusely increased opacities. 

Subacute:  diffuse micronodules, ground-glass, focal air trapping, and mild fibrotic changes.

Chronic:  may see mixture of ground glass, air trapping, cystic changes with fibrotic changes.

Diagnosis:  Combination of clinical, radiographic, PFT's, and bronchioalveolar lavage can suggest diagnosis.  Biopsy may be needed.
