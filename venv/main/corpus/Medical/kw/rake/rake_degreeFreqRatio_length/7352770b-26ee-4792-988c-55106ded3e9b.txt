• Decreased level of consciousness.
• No focal neurological deficit noted.
Vitamin K and supportive therapy
• CT shows "thickening" of the falx and the tentorium bilaterally
• MRI shows extensive bilateral extraaxial subdural fluid consistent with hematoma (SDH) overlying both cerebral hemispheres.  The SDH is also seen layering in between the cerebral hemishperes; and, along the tentorial leaves - extending into posterior fossa.
Acute bilateral subdural hematomas, convexity, interhemispheric, tentorial
• Subdural empyema
• Subdural hematoma
• Subarachnoid hematoma
• Epidural  hematoma
