Nasal exam reveals bilateral swollen turbinates and discharge. Oral exam shows swollen tissue present in the posterior oropharynx, noisy breathing, and only breathing through mouth. Pulmonary exam shows good aeration with some airway compromise.
Pre-op oral steroids, antibiotics, and nasonex to decrease the size of the polyp. Surgery consisted of polyp resection with bilateral maxillary antrostomies and bilateral ethmoidectomies. Post-op, patient was given Augmentin x14 days and Tylenol prn for fever.

Bilateral surgeries were required because of extensive bilateral inflammatory change.

CT showed a large mass filling the nasopharynx and oropharynx that extended from the right maxillary sinus through the right nasal cavity suggestive of antrochoanal polyp. Paranasal sinus disease is also noted.
