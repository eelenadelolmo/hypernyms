urine oxalate of 130 mg/day
Improving post liver transplant
• Radiographs of the spine demonstrate diffusely increased density
• The kidneys also appear hyperdense (no recent IV contrast administration). 
• Surgical staples consistent with recent liver transplant.

23 yo man who has a history of recurrent calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis treated with pyridoxine.  He also has a cardiac arrythmia and recently underwent a liver transplant.
The images reveal severe cortical nephrocalcinosis, osteosclerosis, and renal osteodystrophy.  The differential diagnosis for cortical nephrocalcinosis includes renal cortical necrosis, chronic or hereditary glomerulonephritis, and oxalosis, and renal transplant rejection.  Consider why this young patient has cortical nephrocalcinosis and has had a liver transplant.

The patient clinically has primary hyperoxaluria ( urine oxalate > 80 mg / day).  Primary hyperoxaluria is usually divided into two autosomal recessive diseases: Type 1 (peroxisomal liver AGT enzyme disorder) and Type 2 (cytosolic enzyme disorder).  Usually type 2 hyperoxaluria has a mild clinical course (unlike this case).

This patient has Type 1 primary hyperoxaluria (PH1) and "oxalosis."  Oxalosis refers to calcium oxalate deposition in tissues other than the kidney which occurs when oxalateretention due to renal failure is added to oxalate over-production due to a metabolic condition.

PH1 is caused by a rare inborn error in liver metabolism (autosomal recessive) in which excessive amounts of oxalic acid are formed which combine with calcium and deposit throughout the body (kidney, soft tissue, bone).  The hepatic peroxisomal enzyme AGT (alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase) is defective and glyoxylate cannot be converted into glycine; hence, excessive glyoxylate is metabolized into oxalate.

This disorder leads to progressive renal failure secondary to cortical nephrocalcinosis which usually leads to early death in childhood unless dialysis is instituted.  Common radiographic findings in oxalosis include dense kidneys (nephrocalcinosis), dense bones (calcium oxalate crystal deposition and renal osteodystrophy), soft tissue and vascular calcifications, and radiopaque renal calculi.  Treatment includes pyridoxine, dialysis, and liver transplant to replace the defective AGT enzyme.
