N/A
This patient subsequently underwent ballon dilations of the lower esophageal sphinter.
Frontal chest radiograph demonstrated a wideneded mediastinum on the right side, which on the lateral chest radiograph was a mass within the middle mediastinum superiorly and crossed into the posterior mediastinum inferiorly.

Non-contrast CT examination of the chest demonstrates a diffusely dilated esophagus filled with mottled soft tissue consistent with ingested food material.

Imaged from an upper GI fluoroscopic examination demonstrates a dilated thoracic esophagus with a focal narrowing at the gastroesophageal junction.  A complete lack of peristalsis was noted during the examination.
