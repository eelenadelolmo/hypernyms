-Imperforate anus
The patient initially underwent a vesicostomy and gastrostomy followed by a divided diverting colostomy.  The patient underwent further surgery for repair of the esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula.  The fistula was divided, and a standard end-to-end anastomosis was created.  The patient has tolerated all procedures well thus far.
•On the lateral fluoroscopic views of the esophagus, there is a blind-ending, dilated esophageal pouch, which mildly displaces the trachea anteriorly.  An NG Tube is seen within the atretic esophagus.  Contrast administered via the NG tube is seen filling the esophageal pouch.

•On the supine AP plain films of the abdomen, there marked gastric, small bowell and large bowell distension.  However there is no gas present in the region of the rectum.  Also seen on this film is a vertebral anomaly (butterfly vertebra) at the level of T3.  Careful attention to the ribs reveal another associated anomaly - an additional 13th rib pair.

•ECHO reveals an Atrial Septal Defect.  Also found on echocradiography (but not shown here) was a Patent Ductuc Arteriosus.

•On retrograde cystography, lateral views reveal a small fistulous connection between the atretic colorectal region and the posterior urethra.

•These findings fulfill the criteria for VACTER Association.
VACTER Association
•Pharyngeal Pseudodiverticulum (secondary to traumatic perforation of the posterior pharynx - from tube insertion or finger insertion during delivery).

•Larygotracheal Cleft

•PHAVER Syndrome: Pterygia, Heart Anomalies, Vertebral defects, Ear anomalies, Radial defects.
Newborn male presents with excessive oral secretions and increasing abdominal distension.
Inital findings on physical exam included an imperforate anus.    The patient went on to develop excessive oral secretions and progressive abdominal distension.  With these combined findings, VACTER or VACTERL Association was suspected.  This patient did not have associated radial ray anomalies.

Plain films of the abdomen confirmed marked gaseous distension of the stomach and small/large bowell.  Plain films also verified the presence of several other associated anomalies (vertebral and rib anomalies).

Due to the excessive oral excretions, an upper GI exam was attempted.  An attempt was made to pass an NG tube, but the tube could not be advanced past the thoracic inlet.  Fluoroscopic images confirmed a suspected esophageal atresia.  This finding combined with the patient's marked gaseous abdominal distesion points toward the presence of a Distal Type Tracheoesophageal Fistula.

Cardiac anomalies are the most frequently encountered findings with VACTER/VACTERL Association (77%).  Echocardiography was performed to search for associated cardiac anomalies.  An atrial septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus were discovered.

Urethrocystography was performed with contrast administered via a suprapubic catheter to search for fistulous colorectal/urinary connections.  A small fistula between the colorectal region and the posterior urethra ("High Lesion") was discovered.  This urethrorectal fistula type is much more common in males.
