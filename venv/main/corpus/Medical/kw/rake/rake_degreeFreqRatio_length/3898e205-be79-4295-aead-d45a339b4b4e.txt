Ill defined hip pain on L worse than R.
Femoral neck pinning (prophylactic in this case, mandatory in the case of a displaced fracture)
Subtle sclerotic line on plain films at the compressive side of femoral neck on Left.  Correlates with fracture seen on MR with associated edema (increased T2 signal).  There is also edema, but no fracture, on the contralateral side.
Femoral Neck Stress Fracture
Insufficiency fracture
Fatigue fracture
Traumatic fracture
Sclerotic bone lesion
19 yo USNA student with groin pain.  Prior radiographs of hips were negative.  These images were obtained 10 days later, with continued pain after running.
This patient had a typical history of a military athlete with chronic repetitive stress and indistinct groin pain.  The patient's stress fracture was further delineated with MR to assess for extent - in this case 75-80% of the diameter of the femoral neck.  The neck was pinned prophylactically.  If the fracture is displaced, it is a surgical emergency, since the fracture may disrupt blood supply to the femoral head, causing AVN of the femoral head.
