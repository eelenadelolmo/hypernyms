Non-contributory
Ventricular shunt inserted into right lateral ventricle.
• Hydrocephalus of both lateral ventricles
• Cystic mass in the left frontal horn of the lateral ventricle, extending into the foramen of Monro.
• The lesion has a central solid bit - a "target sign"
• Enhancing component noted within cyst which is calcified on the CT scan,  may be a scolex.
Neurocysticercosis
• Arachnoid cyst
• Subpendymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma
• Central neurocytoma
• Colloid Cyst
• Cysticercosis larvae
23 year old Mexican man with 3 months of severe headache.
Cysticercosis - taenia solium - as been a parasitic infection of man for over 10,000 years.  Fecal contamination of pig feed leads to infection in swine - producing numerous cysts in the meat, or "measly" pork  NOTE: While some sources suggest trichinae as the cause of "measly" pork - it is larval cysticercosis that produces cysts within the pork.
