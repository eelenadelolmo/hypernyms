Non-contributory
Ventricular shunt inserted into right lateral ventricle.
â€¢ Hydrocephalus of both lateral ventricles
â€¢ Cystic mass in the left frontal horn of the lateral ventricle, extending into the foramen of Monro.
â€¢ The lesion has a central solid bit - a "target sign"
â€¢ Enhancing component noted within cyst which is calcified on the CT scan,  may be a scolex.
Neurocysticercosis
â€¢ Arachnoid cyst
â€¢ Subpendymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma
â€¢ Central neurocytoma
â€¢ Colloid Cyst
â€¢ Cysticercosis larvae
23 year old Mexican man with 3 months of severe headache.
Cysticercosis - taenia solium - as been a parasitic infection of man for over 10,000 years.  Fecal contamination of pig feed leads to infection in swine - producing numerous cysts in the meat, or "measly" pork  NOTE: While some sources suggest trichinae as the cause of "measly" pork - it is larval cysticercosis that produces cysts within the pork.
