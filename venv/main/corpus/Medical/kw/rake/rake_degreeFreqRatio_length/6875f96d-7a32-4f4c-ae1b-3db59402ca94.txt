Patient appeared thin.  Laboratory values were remarkable for a Hgb of 10.8, Hct of 32.4, CEA of 10.6 (nl 0.0-4.6), CA 27-29 of 67 (nl 0-37), and ammonia of 89 (nl 7-33).
This woman had known metastatic breast cancer, and these studies were obtained for routine follow-up. She is being treated with chemotherapy and is followed with serial bone scans to monitor response.
Anterior and posterior delayed whole body images demonstrate abnormal increased radiotracer uptake in the lower lumbar spine, as well as a focal area of increased uptake in the soft tissues superior to the right kidney.  Additionally, increased radiotracer uptake is seen bilaterally about the shoulders, knees (RT>LT), and ankles (LT>RT).   Contrast abdominal CT image demonstrates multiple masses throughout the liver, largely replacing normal hepatic parenchyma.  Coronal reformat nicely demonstrates the densely sclerotic lesion within the L4 vertebral body corresponding to the abnormal focus of radiotracer accumulation on the bone scan.
Metastatic breast cancer to the liver and lumbar spine.  Other areas of increased radiotracer uptake represent arthritis and/or stress changes.

50-year old woman presents for skeletal scintigraphy to monitor treatment response.
One of the most common applications of skeletal scinitgraphy is in evaluating patients with extraskeletal malignancy for the presence of metastatic disease.  Skeletal scintigraphy has the advantage of being able to survey the entire skeleton.  While it is a sensitive test, it is not specific.  Abnormal uptake on a bone scan may represent metastatic disease, arthritis, areas of trauma or infection, as well as benign bone dysplasias.  Thus, the differential can be quite broad, and it is useful to further evaluate questionable areas with further imaging, as was done in this case.

Skeletal scintigraphy is commonly used for inital staging in patients with malignancy, as well as in monitoring response to therapy, and in detecting areas at risk for pathologic fracture.  The bone scan in this patient demonstrates several areas of abnormal uptake in the skeleton, as well as a focal region of soft tissue uptake.  This is an important reminder that when evaluating a bone scan one must look for not only abnormal bone uptake, but also soft tissue uptake, as soft tissue metastases may accumulate sufficient radiotracer to be visualized.  

Breast cancer, along with prostate, lung, thyroid, and renal cancer, is one of the most common nonosseous tumors to metastasize to bone.
