Well developed female with tenderness to palpation on the knees
Three dominat ossification centers of the patella with well corticated and incongruent non-additive borders.

No soft tissue abnormality
Tripartite Patellae
Tripartate patella
Patellar Fracture
Calcific Tendinosis
Post traumatic sequelae
31 Year-old female with bilateral knee pain after fall
In this patient, the osseous fragments associated with the patellas bilaterally have smooth, corticated margins, rather than sharp edges.  The fragments are incongruent and non-additive - that is, if they were put together, they would not "add up" to a normal patella.  These findings, along with the lack of soft tissue swelling or joint effusion,  distinguish tripartite patella from a comminuted patellar fracture.
