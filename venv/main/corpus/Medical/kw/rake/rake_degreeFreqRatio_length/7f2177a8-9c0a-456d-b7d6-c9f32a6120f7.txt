54 yo woman presents for evaluation of ringing in left ear over a month. Pt reports high-pitched, non-pulsatile tinnitus that initially was constant for two weeks. She then had a period of 2-3 weeks where she was asymptomatic. Tinnitus has now returned, worse in the morning and lasts for 2-3 hours, then is intermittent throughout the day. Pt denies ear fullness, hearing loss, vertigo, or nausea/vomiting. No history of trauma, stroke, or noise exposure. Reports vague history of light headedness and balance problem (not vertigo), which she was referred to be seen by outside neurologist but has not followed-up on. Had audiogram done which is essentially normal.
