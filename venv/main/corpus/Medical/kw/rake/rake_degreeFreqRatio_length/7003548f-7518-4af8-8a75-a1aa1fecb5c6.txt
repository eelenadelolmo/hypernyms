Painless palpable testicular mass within the left testicle.

AFP  3.3 ng/ml (normal)
HCG Quantitative less than 0.1 mIU/ml (normal)
LDH 505 U/L (normal)

Pathologic specimen status post orchiectomy demonstrated a mixed germ cell tumor with a  predominant embryonal carcinoma component and a smaller yolk sac tumor component involving less than 5% of the testicle.
Orchiectomy for testicular mass.  Based on the type of tumor and staging, chemotherapy, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, surveillance, and radiation therapy can be performed.
Within the mid to upper pole of the left testicle, there is a heteroechoic well defined mass with a smaller internal hyperechoic focus demonstrating posterior shadowing.  The mass in the left testicle measures 1.6 cm x 1.8 cm x 1.7 cm.  Normal testicular blood flow was seen around and within the mass on color Doppler.  Additionally, small hydroceles were seen around both testicles.

The patient presented with a painless left testicular mass.
Nonseminomatous tumors such as the one in this case most often occur among men in their thirties.  This patient was slightly younger than the average age for nonseminomatous tumors since he was only 23 years old.  Testicular tumors are the most common malignancy in the age group of 15-35 years.

Embryonal carcinomas are more aggressive than seminomas.  Only 3% of nonseminomatous germ cell tumors are pure embryonal carcinomas.  Around 45% of mixed germ cell tumors contain embryonal components.  This patient’s mixed germ cell tumor had mixed histologic characteristics involving yolk sac tumor and embryonal carcinoma.  

This patient’s mixed germ cell tumor had ultrasound characteristics which are typical for embryonal carcinoma.  Embryonal carcinomas like the one in this case are predominantly hypoechoic lesions with poorly defined margins and an inhomogeneous echotexture.  This tumor also had echogenic foci within it which often represent hemorrhage, calcification, or fibrosis.  The mass was palpable which may occur with embryonal carcinomas since tumor invasion of the tunica albuginea is common and may distort the contour of the testis.  This tumor did not extend beyond the tunica vaginalis though.

Although this tumor has a small yolk sac tumor component, the patient’s AFP (alpha fetoprotein) level was not elevated or abnormal.  Yolk sac tumors are frequently seen in tumors with mixed histologic features in adults and indicate a poorer prognosis.  The ultrasound appearance of yolk sac tumors is consistent with the inhomogeneous appearance and echogenic foci seen in this patient’s tumor.
