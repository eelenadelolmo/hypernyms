Texto: 
Patient is awaiting formal bone marrow biopsy for confirmation, and will undergo chemotherapy for known breast cancer.
Plain films of the knee demonstrate an ill-defined area of sclerosis along the posterior lateral aspect of the femur, superior to the patella.

MRI of the tibia demonstrate focal decreased T1 signal and increased signal on IR corresponding to the area of plain film abnormality.
Metastatic Disease (Presumed Breast)
-Metastatic Disease
-Primary marrow malignancy
History of breast cancer, recently diagnosed.  Now c/o progressive left knee pain.
This young woman had a suspicious lump in her left breast.  After FNA and a later core biopsy, this was determined to be infiltrating ductal carcinoma.  She has not yet undergone mastectomy.  If it were not for the breast cancer diagnosis, her presentation with knee pain and the vague plain-film finding might normally not have raised such a high level of concern to warrant an MRI.
