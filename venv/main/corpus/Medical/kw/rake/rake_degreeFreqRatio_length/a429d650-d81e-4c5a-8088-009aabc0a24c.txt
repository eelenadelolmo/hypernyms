Prophylatic antibiotics and follow up imaging.
The bladder demonstrates normal contour on early and late filling phases.  The bladder capacity is normal.  However, on voiding images, reflux of contrast is seen to enter the right ureter and pelvicaliceal system with mild dilation of the calices.  No dilation of the fornices is demonstrated.
Mild reflux into the distal left ureter is also seen.
Idiopathic vesicoureteral reflux
Grade 2/3 reflux on the right and grade 1 on the left (see factoid).
Vesicoureteral reflux
-Abnormal anatomy of distal ureters
-Abnormal detrusor muscle function
-Neurogenic Bladder (spinal bifida)
-posterior urethral valve (in boys)
-Idiopathic reflux
Eight year old female with history of multiple urinary tract infections and one documented incident of pyelonephritis.
