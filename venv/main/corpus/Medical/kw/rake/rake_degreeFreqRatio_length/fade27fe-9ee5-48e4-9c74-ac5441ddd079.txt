Supportive
• MRA neck:  No signal in left Internal Carotid artery.
• Angiogram:  Dissection of left ICA with very slow filling of distal cervical ICA.
Carotid Artery Dissection
• Atherosclerosis with high grade stenosis.
• FMD  (fibromuscular dysplasia)
54 year old man presents with right sided weakness and dysarthria
This case is a good example a false positive MRA of the neck.  Occlusion of the carotid artery should not be assumed if there is no signal within the diseased vessel on MRA.  A high grade stenosis with slow flow will have the same MRA features.
