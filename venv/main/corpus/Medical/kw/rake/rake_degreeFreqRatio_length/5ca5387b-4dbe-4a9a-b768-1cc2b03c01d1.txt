CT following MVA in ER shows a subtle increased interspinous distance at C5-6 and minimally displaced inferior facet fracture on right at C6.

Plain film done on the present admission shows locked facets at C5-C6 with marked anterior subluxation.
C-spine fracture with locked facets
Hyperflexion injury with bilateral locked facets
