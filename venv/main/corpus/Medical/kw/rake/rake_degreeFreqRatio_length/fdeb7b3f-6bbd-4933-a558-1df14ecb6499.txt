No palpable masses on breast exam.
Uneventful status post needle localization and open surgical excision.
Bilateral mammography was performed.  Mediolateral (MLO) and craniocaudal (CC) views as well as bilateral spot magnification CC views of the breasts show dilated subareolar ducts as well as bilateral, well-circumscribed 5-6mm nodular masses.  The masses are located at the 0400 position at the left breast and at the 0900 position of the right breast.  Patient subsequently underwent breast sonography at these locations.

Sonography of the left breast at the 0400 position, Zone 2A and of the right breast at the 0900 position, Zone 2B, was performed.  Images show dilated ducts bilaterally.  Intraductal round soft tissue masses are also present.  Patient underwent needle localization and open surgical biopsy of both breast lesions, and pathology revealed bilateral intraductal papillomas.  Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) was also noted at the right breast, and fibrocystic changes were present bilaterally.
Multiple, bilateral intraductal papillomas of the breast
Mammogram differential diagnosis of a small, well-circumscribed mass includes, but is not limited to:
Intraductal papilloma
Papillomatosis
Papillary carcinoma
Cyst
Fibrocystic change
Rarely, a small, well-circumscribed malignancy (other than the above-mentioned papillary carcinoma)

Sonogram differential diagnosis of a small, round mass within a dilated duct:
Intraductal papilloma
Papillomatosis
Rarely, papillary carcinoma
Blood clot (esp. in a patient on coumadin)
The patient is a 55 year old female who presents for mammography.  No history of nipple discharge.
