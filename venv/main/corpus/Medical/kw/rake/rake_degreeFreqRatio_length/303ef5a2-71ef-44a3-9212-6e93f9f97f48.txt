MR Brain-IAC protocol performed
None required.
Incidentally noted, adjacent to the trigone of left lateral ventricle are multiple linear hyperintensities on T1 post Gad axial images.
Developmental Venous Anomaly (Venous Angioma)
None.
38 y.o. male with asymmetric hearing loss.
These linear structures represent venous tributaries that are seen to coalesce into a larger venous structure that becomes a draining vein into the subependymal region of the left lateral ventricle.  There is normal brain parenchyma interposed between these vascular structures.  There is no mass effect or further abnormal signal adjacent to these structures.
