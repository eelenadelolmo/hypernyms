-The mortality for untreated contained aortic transections is over 90% at 1 month.
Aortic transection at aortic isthmus with resulting pseudoaneurysm.
Aortic transection
None
39 y/o man in motor vehicle accident.  CT angiography at outside institution was reported as "abnormal" and patient was evacuated for further evaluation.
The etiology of aortic transections and the injury"s high predilection for involving the aortic isthmus is secondary to traction of the relatively mobile aortic arch in relation to the relatively fixed descending thoracic aorta; or, may be related more specifically to direct compression and shearing forces on the aorta between the clavicular head and spine.
