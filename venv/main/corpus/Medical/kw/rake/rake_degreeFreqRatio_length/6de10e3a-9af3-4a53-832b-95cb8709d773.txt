Normal physical exam to include a detailed neurologic exam.  Labs are normal.
Work-up by MRI demonstrated a left sided high pareital lesion highly suspicious of cavernous hemangioma.  This was confirmed by surgical exploration and pathological confirmation. Post-operatively, this patient howed no neurological defecits and follow-up CT scans revealed post-operative changes and no current evidence of recurrence.
- MRI, brain shows superior posterior left parietal mass with moderate associated white matter edema with low signal consistent with hemosiderin or calcification GRE.
-CT with and without contrast consistent with above mentioned mass in left pareital area with calcifications.
Cavernous Angioma of left parietal lobe
1. Cavernous Hemangioma 
2. Arteriovenous malformation
3. Hemorrhagic metastasis
4. Oligodengroglioma
8 year old white female with new onset seizures.
This is an 8 year old female who presented with new onset seizures which were increasing in frequency over one week and which were unresponsive to anticonvulsants.  An MRI demonstrated a high left parietal lesion highly suggestive of a cavernous hemangioma with ring signal dropout consistent with hemosiderin which suggests a remote bleed.  The history of a symptomatic cavernous hemangioma is an indication for surgical resection and as indicated in the Cohen, et. al  (J Neurosurgery). This patient has a high likelihood of seizure improvement with lesionectomy as the onset of her seizures is less than 1 year.
