Neoplasm Name: Pilocytic Astrocytoma 

Synonyms: Juvenile pilocytic, spongioblastoma 

ICD-O code: 

Cell of Origin: Astrocyte 

WHO Grade(s): Grade 1 

Genetics and Associations: Occures in the optic nerve in NF-1 

Demographics (Age, Sex, Incidence): Most common in childhood, with a peak incidence 9 - 15 years. Slight female predilection (13:9 F>M). Accounts for approximately 1/3 of pediatric posterior fossa neoplastic masses. 

Common Locations: Cerebellum >> hypothalamus > brainstem, cerebral hemisphere, spinal cord 

Gross Appearance: Circumscribed with very narrow zone of infiltration, mural nodule and fluid collection ("cyst") 

Histology: biphasic with dense and loose areas, microcysts, Rosenthal fibers 

Special Stains: 

Radiology: "cyst with nodule" showing intense enhancement of nodule on MR and CT. Largely hypovascular or avascular on angiography 

Progression: Does not progress 

Prognosis and Treatment: Surgical resection is often curative 

COMMENTS: Most benign of astrocytoma types, most common subtype of astrocytoma in posterior fossa in children, most common type of hypothalamic glioma
