Diminished dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses of at left ankle.
Bilateral vascular by-pass grafts.
Image 1 demonstrates occlusion of the majority of the left popliteal artery with medial deviation of the most proximal portion which does contain contrast.

Image 2 demonstrates a patent but also medially deviated right popliteal artery (passive plantar flexion)

Image 3 demonstrates, with the patient now in active plantar flexion, extrinsic compression and continued medial deviation of right popliteal artery
Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome
atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease
popliteal artery entrapment syndrome
thrombosis of a popliteal artery aneurysm
Thrombosis of the left popliteal artery due to an intrinsic or aquired abnormality of coagulation.
Cardiac thromboembolic phenomenon.
extrinsic compression by a soft tissue mass
