Orthopedic referral for Hip Arthroscopy and possible repair.
Intra-articular Gadolinium was administered under fluoroscopy followed by MRI imaging.  Sagittal and Axial T1 and T1 fat saturated images show abnormal linear and irregular signal in the anterior superior labrum consistent with the labral tear.  Gadolinium is visualized within the joint space and accentuates visualization of the labral tear.
