Surgical team was present during the UGI and afterwards recommended non-surgical management with TPN.
Spot images from an upper GI series demonstrate abrupt caliber change at the junction of the second and the third portion of the duodenum, with the second portion markedly dilated.  There is a rather prominent tubular impression at this transition point, which is the impression made by the superior mesenteric artery.  Note that the ligament of Treitz is in its normal location, ruling out malrotation.
