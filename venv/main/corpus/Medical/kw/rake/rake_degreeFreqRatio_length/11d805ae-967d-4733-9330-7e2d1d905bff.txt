Arachnoid cysts should be included in the differential diagnosis of cystic extra-axial lesions of the brain. These cysts are benign cysts and are caused by focal impairment in CSF circulation that causes cystic dilation of subarachnoid space. They do not communicate with the ventricular system.  They account for approximately 1% of all intracranial space-occupying lesions. The majority of these cysts (50-60%) are found in the floor of the middle cranial fossa, while one-fourth to one-third of occur in the posterior fossa, particularly in the retrocerebellar, cerebellopontine, and quad-rigeminal plate cisterns.  They may also occur in the spinal cord. The male-to-female ratio is 4:1, and asymptomatic patients can present at any age.  

Arachnoid cysts vary in size and stability.  They can be small to large in size, and if very large can cause mass effect and bony erosion.  If small, cysts may not be seen due to partial volume averaging.  Expansion of the Sylvian &#64257;ssure or bony scalloping may indicate the presence of a cyst. Also, cysts may be stable in size over time, or may grow and expand with CSF secretion over time.

Congenital abnormalities, caused by arachnoid clefts or duplications within the arachnoid membrane, are the most common cause of arachnoid cysts.  A small number may also be acquired from things like adhesions following leptomeningitis, hemorrhage, surgery or in association with neoplasms.  Arachnoid cyst expansion most likely occurs because of CSF pulsating through a ball-valve mechanistic defect in the cyst wall.

The walls of arachnoid cysts are formed from a splitting of the arachnoid membrane, with inner and outer leaflets surrounding the cyst cavity. Cysts are lined by arachnoid tissue, but the walls are slightly more dense than normal arachnoid tissue, and sometimes may have undergone hyaline change.   The cyst walls lack blood vessels, making hemorrhage or inflammatory changes uncommon. 

The most common presenting symptoms of arachnoid cysts are headache, calvarial bulging, and seizures.   Focal neurologic signs occur less frequently, and if present depend on the location of the arachnoid cyst.  Arachnoid cysts may rarely to rupture into the subdural space or undergo intracystic hemorrhage. Middle cranial fossa cysts have been linked to ipsilateral chronic subdural hematomas. 

Arachnoid cysts are often found incidentally on imaging.  On CT scans, they are seen as a structure isodense to CSF, with sharp nonenhancing borders.  The walls of an arachnoid cyst are smooth on CT, as opposed to those of an epidermoid cyst, which are most often irregular.

MRI can demonstrate the exact location, extent, and relationship of the cyst, as well as differentiate arachnoid from epidermoid cysts.  CSF signal is seen within the well-defined cyst on all sequences.  Epidermoids also may have a signal identical or very similar to that of arachnoid cyst on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images.  To differentiate this from arachnoid cysts FLAIR as well as diffusion weighted sequences are used. On the FLAIR sequence, , an arachnoid cysts follow the CSF signal, so no signal seen, while there is a higher signal with FLAIR in epidermoid cysts.  With DWI, diffusion is reduced within epidermoids, which then appear brighter than CSF, but for arachnoid cysts the signal intensity is low.  In some instances though, arachnoid cysts may contain proteinaceous fluid or blood, and signal loss on DWIs may not be marked, which can cause diagnostic confusion.

Plain radiographic findings are nonspecific and are not valuable offer in the diagnosis of arachnoid cysts, except for changes in skull contour due to large cysts.

Large arachnoid cysts should be considered for serial scans because they may show progressive enlargement, and patients may become candidates for surgical consideration. Indications for surgical intervention include hydrocephalus and increased  intracranial pressure. Surgery for asymptomatic cysts is controversial.  The most effective surgical treatment appears to be excision of the outer cyst membrane and cystoperitoneal shunting.
