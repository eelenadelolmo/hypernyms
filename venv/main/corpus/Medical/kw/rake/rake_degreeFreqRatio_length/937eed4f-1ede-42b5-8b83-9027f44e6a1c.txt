• CT scan showed a macrolobulated and elongated nodule in the left lung lingula - 2.3 X 1.4 cm. 
• No evidence of mediastinal or axillary adenopathy.

• lung granuloma
• image artifact
• infection
• trauma
• lung carcinoma
52 y/o  man fell off a truck and now presents with left sided chest wall pain.
This patient presented for rib pain secondary to trauma and a left lung mass (solitary pulmonary nodule) was discovered incidentally on CXR and followed up with additional studies to include PET and definitive surgical removal.
