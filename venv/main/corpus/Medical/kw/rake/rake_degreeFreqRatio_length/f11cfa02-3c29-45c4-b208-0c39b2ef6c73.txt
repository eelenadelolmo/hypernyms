Texto: 
Per CIS notes, upon arrival, pt moved only upper extremities, did not open eyes, pupils were small, and did not follow commands.  No further PE found.
Address ABCs with intubation if patient is obtunded
Transport to nearest facility with CT scan and neurosurgery backup
Non-contrast CT of head
Diagnostic cerebral angiogram (if no lesion found then MRI)
Possible ventricular catheter placement, endovascular aneurysm coiling, open microsurgical clipping, or hemicraniectomy
On non-contrast CT of head, fluid-fluid level with tracking into ventricles noted.  Ventricular catheter on R frontal noted.  Scattered aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage seen in sulci.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage, aneurysm
Rupture of saccular aneurysm, AVM, angioma, neoplasm
Meningitis, TIA, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke
64 y.o. male medivac’ed.  Per daughter, pt had a hx of sudden severe HA one month ago.  Seven days ago, pt had LOC.  Ventricular catheter on right frontal placed at outside hospital.
In the U.S., annual incidence of aneurismal non-traumatic SAH 6-25 per 100,000.  About 10-15% of pts die before they reach the hospital. Mortality as high as 40% within first week.  Better/prompt management decreases mortality rates, although 1/3 have neurologic deficits.  Pt usu. experience severe HA and about half presents with LOC.  Most importantly, addressing ABC is crucial at the beginning and transferring the pt to hospital with appropriate facility.  Non-contrast CT is initial study of choice. Once dx is made, cerebral angiography used to assess vascular anatomy, current bleeding site, and present of other aneurysms.  It also helps with operative planning mentioned above.
