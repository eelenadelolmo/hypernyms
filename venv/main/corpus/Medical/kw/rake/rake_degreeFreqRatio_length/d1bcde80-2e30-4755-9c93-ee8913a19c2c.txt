T 36.4   HR 88   RR 16   BP 123/45  Wt. 59.7kg 
General:  alert and oriented x3, cooperative and interactive during exam
HEENT:  Rt. Eye sclera injected.  Rt. Facial hypertrophy extending onto nasal bridge and posteriorly to the rt. auricle.  Firm to palpation with no tenderness or warmth.  Right gingival hypertrophy is noted with midline shift of tongue and soft tissues of mouth.  Abnormal dentition.  Oropharynx is patent.  Port wine stain over right face.  
Extremities:  Hemi hypertrophy of right side with respect to the left.  Syndactyly of the second and third digit on the right hand.  
Skin:  Port wine stain over approximately 80% of body.
Remainder of exam was within normal limits
Pt was referred to oral surgeon for future treatment.
Plain Films:  considerable facial asymmetry is noted with enlargement of the right mandible and maxilla.  There is a ground glass appearance to the bone.  There is loss of the lamina dura and the teeth are displaced.  Appearance suggests polyostotic fibrous dysplasia.
CT:  There is considerable facial asymmetry by marked enlargement of the right side o the mandible and right maxilla.  The bone has a ground glass appearance with thinning of the cortex.  There is ossifying bone surrounding most of the mandible extending from the inferior body to the mandibular condyle.  There is also ossifying bone at the right maxilla.  C2 vertebra also shows thickening and appears more sclerotic than the mandible.  The right zygomatic arch is quite thickened.  There is loss of the lamina dura at the teeth and many teeth are missing or distorted in position.    
MRI:   There is significant asymmetry of the facial structures with the right face being much more prominent than the left.  There is some asymmetry of the skin in the right in comparison with the left but the predominate abnormality lies in soft tissue and bone.  There is significant bony dysplasia with thickening of the bony table across the midline in the frontal region.  There is continuation of this thickening into the maxilla and the mandible is also markedly dysplastic.  No significant increase in vascularity was seen.  There is marked remodeling of the mandibular condyle on the right with hypertrophy of the soft surrounding the mandible.  There is no evidence of bony destruction.  There is abnormal dentition in the right jaw.
Klippel Trenaunay Weber Syndrome
Osteogenic sarcoma, infection, soft tissue sarcoma
15-year-old male presented with complaint of progressively increasing right facial enlargement.  Pt noted that the lower half of his face was showing the most marked growth.  Pt father reported that growth began approximately 2 months prior to presentation with more rapid enlargement in the past two weeks.  Pt father also noticed that the growth was causing significant shift of soft tissue in his mouth.  Pt reports no pain or difficulty breathing. Pt denies any trauma.
