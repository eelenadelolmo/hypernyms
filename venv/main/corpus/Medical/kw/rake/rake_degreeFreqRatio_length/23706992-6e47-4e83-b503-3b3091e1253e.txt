Tachycardic and tachypneic.
Perforation and Management:
•	1-5%
•	Contained v. complete rupture; no esophageal serosa
•	Corrosive stricture is major risk factor
•	 Aggressive conservative treatment-  nasopharyngeal aspiration, broad spectrum antibiotics, prompt drainage of effusions and either parenteral or infraesophageal nutritition
•	Surgical primary repair/colonic interposition- large tear, free intrapleural leak; stricture resection with primary anastamosis
•	Gastrostomy with retrograde dilation may prevent perforation in corrosive stricture cases
•	Mediastinitis, septicemia, death if not promptly treated
Water soluble esophagram in multiple oblique planes demonstrates and intact esophagus and normally positioned GE junction.  The Nissen filling defect is expected.

Barium esophagram demonstrates a contained linear collection of contrast outlining the posteromedial aspect of the esophageal wall.
Esophageal Perforation Status Post Dilation
Pathognomonic.
Pleuritic pain and dyspnea following esophageal dilation for tight Nissen fundoplication.
This patient underwent balloon dilation for dysphagia status post Nissen fundoplication for refractory reflux.  His perforation was contained and he was managed with observation, fluid replacement, broad spectrum antibiotics and nasoduodenal tube placement for infraesophageal nutrition. It is important to follow a negative water-soluble exam with a barium exam.
