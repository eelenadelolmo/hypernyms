The right mediport was removed after appropriate placement of a new left mediport.
Right mediport catheter tubing malposition, with the proximal tubing coursing cephalad in an extra-vascular location prior to heading caudad into the region of the right brachiocephalic vein.  No evidence of catheter kinking or fracture.  A new mediport has been placed on the left, with normal position of the distal catheter tip in the right atrium.  The right mediport was subsequently removed.
