Clinical findings of sciatica. Bilateral, asymmetric sensory deficits and motor dysfunction of the lower extremity.
Surgical excision of the tumor with regular postoperative follow up.

During postoperative follow up at a 5 month interval, sagittal and axial gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images demonstrate no evidence of residual disease or recurrence of the tumor.
• Sagittal T1-weighted MR image of the lumbar spine shows a well-defined isointense lesion in the region of filum terminale, located at the level of L1 vertebra.
• Sagittal T2-weighted MR image shows heterogeneous hyperintense nature of the lesion.
• Axial T2-weighted MR image reveals the central location of the lesion within the cord region.
• Gadolinium-enhanced sagittal T1-weighted MR
image demonstrates intense enhancement of the lesion.
Myxopapillary Ependymoma
» Intramedullary:
• Ependymomas
• Astrocytomas
• Hemangioblastomas

» Extramedullary-Intradural:
• ependymoma - myxopapillary type
• Schwannoma
• Meningioma
• Epdermoid/Dermoid
• "Drop" Metastasis
60 year old man presented with a 2 years history of chronic, slowly progressing low back pain and bilateral leg numbness and weakness.
The diagnosis of myxopapillary ependymoma was delayed because symptoms were attributed to sciatica, probably due to the known degenerative spine disease.
