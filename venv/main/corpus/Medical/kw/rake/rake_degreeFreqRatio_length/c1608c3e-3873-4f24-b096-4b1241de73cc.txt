Patient is lethargic, with resolving confusion, afebrile, all vital signs stable with HR 80, BP 141/86. 
HEENT: NC/AT, pupils slightly dilated, EOMI, tympanic membranes clear, CV: RRR, no MRG, Resp: CTA/B, Abd: S/NT/ND + BS, Ext: No CCE, Neuro: CN 2-12 grossly intact, Skin: Warm, no pallor. 

Initial laboratories: WBC 13, H&H 16.5/47.9, Plts 313, PT 14.5, PTT 22.4, INR 1.25, Calcium 10.9, all other electrolytes WNL, AST/ALT 38/46

Drugs of Abuse: Cocaine, cannabinoid, benzodiazepine, opiate all presumptive positive, no amphetamine detected

Urinalysis: moderate ketones
One day after emergency room admission, patient underwent exploratory laparotomy. Via gastrotomy, 10 cocaine packets were removed from the stomach. Additionally, mobilization of the small bowel using Kocher maneuver and dissection of lateral bowel attachments to liver and abdominal wall allowed manipulation of 5 additional packets down to the terminal ileum. Finally, a single packet was removed from the cecum via appendectomy. Patient did require medical intensive care unit care and intubation/ventilation for 12 days post admission.
CT Brain w/o contrast: 
• No mass effect or midline shift
• Ventricles are normal in size and configuration
• Basilar cisterns are unremarkable
• Gray and white matter attenuation is preserved
• There are no intra-axial or extra-axial collections
• The calvarium is intact
• Mastoid air cells are clear
• Paranasal sinuses are clear  


PA and Lateral Chest Radiograph:
• Trachea is midline
• Cardomediastinal silhouette is normal in size shape and position
• The lungs are clear bilaterally with sharp costophrenic angles and posterior recesses
• There are several oval densities projecting in the region of the stomach that appear to demonstrate air fluid levels on the lateral views
• The remainder of the visualized portion is unremarkable
• Bones demonstrate no evidence of fracture
• There is mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm

KUB:
Examination shows at least two separate spherical foreign bodies with thin slightly sclerotic rims in the stomach shadow. Several similar spheres are present in the left mid to lower abdomen and in the right mid abdomen. They are in the range of 2.5 to 3 cm in diameter.

18 y.o.  man, recently returned from vacation in Ecuador, who presents with new onset seizure one hour after arrival in the ED with post-ictal confusion but no focal neurological deficits. Seizure was generalized (witnessed by physician).  The patient received Ativan and Valium, after which he experienced no additional seizures. He did require intubation and ventilation. Of note, he had a dental procedure in Ecuador to relieve pain of an emerging wisdom tooth.
