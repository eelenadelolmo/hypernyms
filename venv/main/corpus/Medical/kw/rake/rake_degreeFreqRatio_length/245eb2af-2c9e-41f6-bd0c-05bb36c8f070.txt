Pt had bilateral total hip arthroplasty
• Knee MR - Patchy bone marrow edema, related to evolving infarcts. Yellow to red marrow conversion.
• Pelvis/Hips - Initial MR with no AVN, but yellow to red marrow conversion present.  Increasing AVN and subchondral collapse on multiple plain films.  
• Spine - Early endplate depressions (H shaped vertebra) and vague sclerosis (infarcts) in L4 and L5 on CT.
Homozygous Sickle Cell Disease with Avascular Necrosis
» Knee
• Evolving infarcts 
• Bone bruises
» Hip Avascular Necrosis
•Sickle cell disease
•Lupus
•Chronic steroids
•Caisson's disease
25 y.o. woman c/o bilateral hip and right knee pain for 2 months.  Increased pain with ambulation.  Denies any injury, trauma, fever, or chills.  Prior "CVA" at age 9.  She gets blood transfusions every 6-8 weeks.
Sickle cell disease can cause avascular necrosis (AVN) through thrombosis during Sickle Crisis and obstruction of the arteries supplying blood flow to and within the bones.
