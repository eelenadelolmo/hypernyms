On admission, the patient was febrile and irritable.Physical examination revealed a palpable soft tissue nodule over the occiput. CSF and laboratory examinations were consistent with bacterial meningitis.
The patient underwent surgery with the posterior fossa mass removed by neurosurgery. The patient was placed on the appropriate pre and post antibiotic prophylaxis. The patient continued to improve during the postoperative period without complications.

Histopathologic workup showed a portion of scalp with a dermal sinus tract. A benign squamous lined cyst with evidence of rupture were included. Additional specimen consisted of typical hair elements and pearly white soft tissue .
Contrast head CT is significant for a multiloculated cystic posterior fossa midline mass that is adjacent to the torcula with a portion extending into the occipital calvarium. This mass is low in density with HU measuring 17. There is rim enhancement with several internal septations. There is distortion of the 4th. ventricle with associated dilatation of the temporal horns.  Bone windows demonstrate smooth calvarial remodeling of the occiput with a small focal dehiscence within the bone that may represent a sinus tract. The overlying skin is unremarkable.  

Brain MRI again demonstrates this intra- extraaxial posterior fossa mass with homogeneous increased T2 , decreased T1 signal. DWI demonstrates marked restricted diffusion which darkens on the ADC map suggesting an abscess, epidermoid,dermoid or other process with restricted diffusion. Mass effect with hydrocephalus is again demonstated. Findings are consistent with a multiloculated intra and extraaxial posterior fossa mass most consistent with cerebritis/abscess. Given the bony remodeling and midline location, findings are most consistent with a congenital process such as dermoid which has become secondarily infected.

21 month old male with high fever, mental status changes and possible seizure.
In this particular case of a young child presenting with a cystic posterior fossa mass, imaging was helpful in narrowing the diagnosis. Evidence of bony remodeling and presence of a sinus tract indicated that this process was a chronic and possibly a congenital process. The midline location of this mass favors a dermoid rather than epidermoid which tends to occur more laterally. The presence of restricted diffusion on the DWI images suggested that this mass may represent an abscess or epidermoid. The presence of enhancement indicated infection which also fit the clinical picture.

In regards to cerebellar abscesses, treatment is dictated by the patient's clinical status, the size and location of the abscess and whether or not a capsule exists. Antibiotics with or without aspiration  or complete excision may be performed.

Other diagnostic possibilities for a cystic posterior fossa mass include a cystic astrocytoma, hemangioblastoma, arachnoid cyst, and an epidermoid cyst. The presence of fat helps diferentiate dermoids from these other lesions. Intracranial lipomas are homogeneous fatty lesions and should not be confused with a heterogeneous lesion such as a dermoid.
