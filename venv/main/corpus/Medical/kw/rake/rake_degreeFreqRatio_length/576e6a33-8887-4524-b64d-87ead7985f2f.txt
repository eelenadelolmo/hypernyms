Image 1: Coronal T2 weighted image shows marked decreased gyral folds, a thin layer of gray matter, and ventriculomegaly leading to diagnosis of type 2 lissencephaly. 

Image 2: Sagittal T2 weighted image shows dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, markedly underdeveloped cerebellar hemispheres, and an enlarged fourth ventricle and widened cerebral aqueduct indicative of hydrocephalus. 

Image 3: Axial T2 weighted FSE image shows significant ventriculomegaly indicative of hydrocephalus. 

Image 4: AP Femur image shows underdeveloped muscle fibers with irregularly bowed and radiolucent bone most prominent at the distal femur.
