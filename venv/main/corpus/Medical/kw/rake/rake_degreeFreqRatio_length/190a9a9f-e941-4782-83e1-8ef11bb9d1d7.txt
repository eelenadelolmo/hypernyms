Surgery service was consulted to determine possibility of surgical resection before or after chemotherapy treatment. Patient was transfered to a tertiary center for further treatment.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:
Lung Bases: 
A 7mm nodule within the lingula and 12 mm nodule within right lung base. No pleural effusions are seen. 
Abdomen:
Large heterogenous mass arising from mid anterior left kidney, measures up to 10.1 cm transverse x 9.6 cm AP x 10.3 cm CC dimensions. Mass exhibits central low attenuation, non-enhancing regions suggestive of necrosis. It causes displacement of the nearby organs and compression of left renal vein. No visualized thrombus within the IVC. The right kidney exhibits normal enhancement without evidence of mass. 

CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:
Multiple pulmonary nodules demonstrated. The largest are: 3.4 x 2.4 x 2.9 cm within left lung apex causing compression of apicoposterior bronchus; a 5 mm nodule within left upper lobe and 9 mm nodule within lingula adjacent to the cardiac margin; 4 mm nodule in posterior right lower lobe and 8 mm nodule within right middle lobe. No hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is demonstrated. 

US RENAL DOPPLER:
Only proximal aspect of the left renal vein is visualized, the distal portion is obscured by large left renal mass. The visualized portion of the left renal vein demonstrates normal Doppler flow without evidence of thrombus. The IVC, right renal vein, splenic, portal and hepatic veins have normal appearance.

2 y.o otherwise healthy male presents to ED with complain of dark urine for last 2 days and one episode of clot seen in urine. Per parents, the patient fell down off the couch approximately 10 days ago, otherwise no recent history of trauma, fever, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal problems or rash. Patient has good appetite and normal pattern of sleep. No apparent complaints of pain, per parents.
