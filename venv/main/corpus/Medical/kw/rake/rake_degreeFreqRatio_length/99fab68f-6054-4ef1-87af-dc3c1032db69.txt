follow up MRI is scheduled post-partum to re-evaluate the lesion.
If only a short interval has elapsed between the hemorrhage and MRI, the hematoma will be most notable as an area of low signal intensity on T2-weighted images.  If imaging is delayed more than 3 days, the same hematoma is most evident as an area of high signal intensity on the T1-weighted images.

Pituitary apoplexy
23 yo female 32 wks pregnant w/ progressively worsening headaches that increases while supine.
This case demonstrates a rare, but associated difficulty with pregnancy, and the MRI shows the characteristic signal pattern of a pituitary hemorrhage.
