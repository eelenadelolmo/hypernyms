Complete Blood Count: WBC 30,400 (increased PMNs); Hemoglobin 13.9; Platelets 436,000
Basic Metabolic Panel was within normal limits.
CSF analysis:  glucose 72mg/dL; protein 160 mg/dL; myelin basic protein 253 ng/mL (0.07-4.10); RBC 240 (87% PMNs); RBC 54; IgG level 19.8 (0.0-6.0); oligocloncal bands were absent.

No evidence for Haemophilus influenzae B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, VDRL, AFB, HSV, CMV, arbovirus (including West Nile Virus), or fungal elements in the CSF fluid.  

Multiple blood  and fungal cultures were negative.  In addition, HIV, Enterovirus PCR , and tuberculin skin testing was negative.  A 2-D transthoracic echocardiogram  was without evidence of valvular vegetations.
This patient received high dose steroids for five days and his condition completely resolved.
Diffuse patchy areas of abnormal signal intensity involving the gray and white matter on T2W and FLAIR sequences, no enhancement and no mass effect.

A 33 year old man presented to his primary medical doctor complaining of diarrhea, vomiting, and fevers up to 39.0? C.  He denied bloody bowel movements, sick contacts, recent antibiotics, suspicion of food poisoning.  He was diagnosed with a gastroenteritis.  Over the subsequent 2-3 days, his gastrointestinal symptoms resolved; however, he continued to have fevers.  Over the next week, he developed worsening headaches.  He would occasionally see spots throughout his visual fields.  He complained of having difficulty moving the entire right side of his body and found himself tripping over his own feet quite frequently.  In addition, he was experiencing difficulty reading complaining, ‚Äúthe words seemed jumbled.‚Äù  Ten days after presentation to his primary medical doctor, he awakened his wife screaming out with violent thrashing.  He began to have tonic-clonic seizure activity with bowel and bladder incontinence.  His wife called EMS.  En route to the Emergency Department, he continued to manifest combative behavior.  Three additional seizures were witnessed.  He was intubated and sedated for airway protection.
This case is slightly atypical in that predominantly ADEM affects the white matter exclusively; in this case it has also affected the gray matter. 

Given the patient's recent history of viral illness, the findings are most consistent with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM).  There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.

ADEM usually occurs one to four weeks after an offending agent.  Viral etiologies include measles, mumps, influenza A and B, Hepatitis A and B, HSV, HHV-6,  Rubella, CMV, EBV, and Varicella, which is the most common.  Bacterial etiologies include Chlamydia, legionella, campylobacter, and most commonly mycoplasma pneumonia.  Post-vaccination etiologies include rabies, DTP, smallpox, measles, Japanese B encephalitis, polio, Hepatitis B, and influenza.  There is a sensitization of peripheral lymphocytes to neural tissue resulting in an inflammatory response directed against neuronal antigens3.  The exact incidence is not known; and often times the offending agent is never identified. Initial symptoms include: low grade fevers, headache, meningismus, drowsiness and  cranial nerve palsies.  There is a progression  of symptoms to stupor, seizures, coma, multifocal neurologic signs, visual difficulties, hemiparesis or paraparesis, ataxia and signs of encephalopathy followed by hyperreflexia and spasticity.  This is a monophasic illness with recovery evident within a few days.  

Diagnosis of ADEM is largely established with neuroimaging.  MRI demonstrates 1) scattered lesions predominately throughout the white matter;  2) increased intensity on T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR;  3) extensive perifocal edema; 4) sparing of the corpus collosum 5) and lesions of the same age and without the appearance of new lesions after the initial study5.  CSF analysis typically shows normal to increase opening pressure, lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, normal glucose, increased IgG, increased MBP, and absence of oligoclonal banding.

The images shown in this case were 6 days after seizure activity. This case was slightly atypical in which there was some gray matter involvement as well.  Conventional ADEM affects the white matter exclusively; though, it can affect both as in this case.
