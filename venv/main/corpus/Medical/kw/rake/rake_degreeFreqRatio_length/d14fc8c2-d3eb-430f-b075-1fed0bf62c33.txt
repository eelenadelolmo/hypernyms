Texto: 
Massive hepatomegaly from costal margin to umbilicus and across the midline of the abdomen.  Transaminase concentrations elevated.  FBS elevated.  Liver biopsy showed marked macrovesicular steatosis without hepatocyte necrosis or Mallory bodies.
Aggressive weight loss, insulin and metformin for 6 months resulted in 38lb weight loss.  Follow up CT showed normal liver size (interval decrease in craniocaudal dimension of 4cm)  and complete resolution of fatty infiltration. Transaminase levels normalized.
Decreased liver parenchyma attenuation, a craniocaudal liver span of 25cm, no metastatic disease or congestion.
DM II and NASH
DM II, Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
Obese with PMHx of COPD, HTN, DJD, and no H/O ETOH abuse presented with SOB, early satiety, BLE edema, and increasing abdominal girth.
