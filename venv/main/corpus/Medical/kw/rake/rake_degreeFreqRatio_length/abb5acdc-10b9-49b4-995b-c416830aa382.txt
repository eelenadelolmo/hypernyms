Physical exam was signficant to decreased sensation to pain and
temperature on right upper and lower extremity and right trunk.
Axial FLAIR images demonstrate multiple punctate foci of signal abnormality in the deep white matter.  Axial and coronal diffusion images demonstrate a single focus of high signal within the left medulla consistent with recent infarct.
Left PICA Infarct confirmed with MRI.  MR angiogram images and CT angiogram images demonstrated a patent vertebral system and patent left PICA.  A focal stenosis was detected at the origin of the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery.
