Left apical chest tenderness,  Dsypnea, and a chronic cough. 
Transbronchial Biopsy:  Non-Small Cell Carcinoma
Patient has stage IV NSCLC.  Patient will be offered both chemotherapy and radiation therapy concurrently. Chemotherapy has been shown to provide both pallative and survival benefits in patient’s with stage IV disease.Radiation therapy has been shown to control hemoptysis in up to 80% of patient’s, a cough in up to 60% of patient’s, and can reduce tumor associated pain in up to 50% of patient’s.Potential synergy with radiation therapy and paclitaxel has been shown.  Paclitaxel stabilizes cells in the radiosensitive G2/M phase of the cell cycle.
• CXR: 
Large destructive left apical mass involving the chest wall.  There is vertebral destruction, pleural metastasis, lymphadenopathy, and a contralateral lung nodules.

• CT: 
1) Large left upper lobe mass with adjacent chest wall invasion with bony destruction and vertebral body destruction.  Multiple left lingular segment masses
2) Right upper lobe mass with adjacent air space disease
3) Mediastinal and left hilar adenopathy
4) Right liver lobe ductal dilatation
5) Right adrenal mass enlargement
6) Left kidney mass

• PET:
1) Malignant neoplasm extensively involving the apical posterior segment of the left upper lobe and extending locally into the mediastinum and the chest wall.  No discontinuous foci within the mediastinum or cervical region specifically to suggest metastatic disease to the lymph nodes.  Several satellite nodules in the left mid lung field and possible nodular metastases to left mid ribs.
Pancoast’s tumor of chest, Stage IV NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer)
• Metastatic Lung Cancer
• Metastatic Kidney Cancer
• Metastatic Liver cancer
67 y/o male presents for further evaluation of an abnormal chest radiograph, discovered during a recent episode of both hepatic and left kidney abscesses.
Patient underwent evaluation for metastatic cancer from an unknown primary source before the chest mass biopsy.
