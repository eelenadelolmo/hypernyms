Unremarkable exam.
No untoward events during hospital stay.
Uneventful post-enema hospital course.  Patient discharged home and continues well without complaint of constipation.
Single contrast enema with dilute gastrograffin was performed in the supine position to the level of the splenic flexure.  Spontaneous evacuation then occurred, expelling a long segment of meconium plug.  During evacuation, a long plug of meconium was outlined by contrast.
Meconium Plug likely secondary to Functional Immaturity of the Colon or Small Left Colon Syndrome (formerly called Meconium Plug Syndrome)
Functional Immaturity of the Colon (Small Left Colon Syndrome) - usually in infant of diabetic mother or whose mother was given magnesium citrate
Cystic Fibrosis - Can be excluded by genetic or sweat testing
