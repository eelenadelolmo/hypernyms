Physical exam is notable for tenderness to palpation around the left clavicle with no skin tenting. Neurovascular exam of the left upper extermity reveals a 3+ radial pulse and intact sensation in the radial, ulnar, and median nerve distributions.
-Open reduction internal fixation
-Expected return to full activities 4-6 weeks post-op
Fully displaced left mid-shaft clavicle fracture with 20mm of shortening
Left mid-shaft clavicle fractures, likely due to accidental trauma
1. Accidental trauma
2. Pathologic fracture
3. Non-accidental trauma
This 18 y.o. presented today with left shoulder pain. The patient fell while snowboarding and landed directly onto his left shoulder. He reports limited range of motion of his arm due to pain - but, he denies numbness or tingling sensation in his left arm.
Most uncomplicated mid-shaft clavicle fractures are treated with non-surgical management. Absolute indications for surgical management include open fracture, skin tenting, and neurovascular compromise, none of which are applicable to this case. Relative indications include polytrauma, >15 to 20 mm of shortening, and 100% displacement. 

This patient had a fully-displaced mid-shaft fracture with 20 mm of shortening. Recently literature favors surgical management for patients with relative surgical indications. A 2017 randomized controlled trail of 304 displaced mid-shaft clavicle fractures showed a significantly higher non-union rate in non-operative (11%) vs operative patients (<1%) The study also found that non-operative patients who subsequently underwent surgery for non-union had worse Constant-Murley and DASH scores at 9 month, indicating decreased functionality. In this patient, the decision for ORIF was made in order to preserve functionality and minimize  the risk of non-union.
