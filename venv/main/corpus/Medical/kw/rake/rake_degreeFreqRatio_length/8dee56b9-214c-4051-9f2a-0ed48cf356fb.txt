Multiple fractures indicated a referral to orthopedics. Since there was evidence of partial healing and minimal pain on exam it was recommended to follow up in 4 weeks with repeat radiographs and exams, to bear weight as tolerated in a hard-soled shoe, no running or impact activities for 6 weeks post-injury, and NSAIDs as needed for pain. Patient followed-up 4 weeks later with an improvement of pain and radiographs demonstrating continued healing of fractures with sclerosis across the fracture site without visualization of the fracture lucency.
Nondisplaced subacute transverse fractures of the third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal head and neck junctions with concomitant soft tissue swelling.
Fracture of left 3rd, 4th, and 5th metatarsals.
1. Metatarsal fracture
2. Stress fracture
3. CRPS
26-year-old Active Duty woman presents with 2 weeks of left foot pain after injuring it on an obstacle course. She reports the injury occurred while she was swinging on a rope and slammed her left foot into a wall. She immediately had pain but was able to ambulate. She described the pain as sharp and distributed along the dorsolateral aspect of the left foot. She reports minimal swelling without bruising or numbness. She attempted to run but was unable secondary to pain. The pain has improved since the injury but is still worse walking barefoot and is more tolerable in boots. She has been taking over the counter Ibuprofen as needed with moderate relief. She notes having a new separation between the 2nd and 3rd left digits and decreased range of motion of 3rd-5th digits compared to the right foot. She denies a history of fractures or other foot injuries. She denies ankle or knee pain. She is otherwise healthy without any chronic medical problems. Good exercise tolerance. Last menstrual period was normal. Father with Type I Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). No significant social history.
Although the patient reported mild pain and was able to tolerate weight-bearing and mild physical activities, her history of trauma, physical exam, and radiographs clearly demonstrated multiple fractures of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th left metatarsals. In general, the 5th metatarsal is the most common fractured metatarsal, however, 60% of middle metatarsal fractures are associated with neighboring fractures. Most metatarsal fractures are caused by direct forces or crushing injuries and occur at the shaft or distal portion of the bone. Distal metatarsal fractures are often minimally displaced in the plantar and lateral direction due to a downward traction of intrinsic muscles and flexor tendons. This could also explain this patient‚Äôs reported new separation of the 2nd and 3rd toes. On exam, she only had point tenderness at the 4th metatarsal, although two others were also fractured. An exam finding that could have revealed the other two fractures is pain elicited when the corresponding toe is pushed into the metatarsal. This would not be painful in a pure soft tissue injury. Stress fractures could also explain the patient‚Äôs presentation especially as they are common in military recruits and are sometimes considered ‚Äúmarch fractures.‚Äù However, the patient had a notable traumatic incident and is without other risk factors such as a change in physical training, pes planus, or female athlete triad. Additionally, most stress fractures are associated with the second metatarsal. An interesting, although rare, differential to consider is CRPS given her father‚Äôs history. CRPS is more common in females, often begins after a trauma, and is a known complication of fractures. Although there have been two studies showing possible relation to HLA-DQ1 and HLA-DR13, there is limited literature showing familial transmission. Radiographs would also be normal or may show bone demineralization. Lastly, the patient did not have any clinical signs or symptoms of CRPS (pain out of portion, autonomic dysfunction, or trophic skin changes);
