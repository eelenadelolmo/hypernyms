Initial head CT demonstrates hyperdense subdural hemorrhage along the right convexity and effacement of sulci and loss of gray-white differentiation of the right cerebrum indicative of diffuse edema. MR shows subdural blood with signal characteristics of extracellular methemoglobin anterior to both frontal lobes and along the tentorium cerebelli on the right. There is restricted diffusion in the right cerebrum due to acute infarction. Frontal radiograph of the ribs shows bilateral lateral acute fractures of the lower ribs, also seen on CT images through the lower chest/upper abdomen. The later CT image shows callus formation in the anterolater lateral ribs bilaterally. The CT through the kidneys shows delayed tubular transit time and excretion on the left which could be due to trauma.
Nonaccidental trauma
0. Accidental head trauma
1. Non-Accidental head trauma
2. Cerebral Infarction
3. Coagulopathy with intracranial hemorrhage
4. Arterial-venous malformation
5. Meningitis/Encephalitis 
6. Seizure disorder
7. Medication toxicity 
8. Osteogenesis imperfecta 
9. Other rare conditions: Menkes syndrome, osteopetrosis, scurvy, hypophosphotasia, congenital syphilitic periostitis, leukemia, vitamin A toxicity, and metabolic and kidney diseases that cause calcium wasting and demineralization
2 year old previously healthy boy brought to ED by mother and her boyfriend. Chief complaints on admission were: vomiting 3-4 times for 5 days, decreased PO intake, decreased activity, problems walking. Mother reports that her son is weak in left arm and left leg, and he falls a lot. She thought it was side effect from Motrin she was giving to the child.
This baby developed irreversable left hemiparesis and left hemianopsia.

The alleged perpetrator has fled the country.
