Patient was tachypnic and pale.  Her oxygen saturation was 93% on room air.  Lab work showed a hematocrit and hemoglobin of 4.5 and 15.7, respectively.  Her coagulation studies were normal.  Blood gas showed a PO2 of 55.
Patient was anticoagulated with heparin and coumadin for treatment of her pulmonary embolus.
A CT PE/DVT protocol was initially performed following transfusion of 3 units of blood.   The study was limited secondary to patientâ€™s respiratory motion.  A questionable filling defect was thought to be
