The patient is a well-appearing, middle-aged female in no apparent distress.  She ambulates without limp.  She is able to answer questions appropriately.  Eyes are anicteric.  Vitals reveal blood pressure 138/76, respiratory rate of 18, pulse of 103, height of 165 cm weight of 99.9 kilos.  Examination of the right lower extremity reveals intact skin with normal capillary refill.  There is normal gross motor and sensory examination of the right foot.  Negative popliteal lymphadenopathy.  Noted is a  5 x 5 cm lesion in the right medial distal thigh in the vastus medialis.  The lesion is nontender to palpation.  There is negative Tinel's test at this site.  Remaining extremities appear normal.
None at this time.
There is an oval lesion with mild diffuse heterogeneous enhancement centered in the distal aspect of the vastus medialis muscle.  The lesion measures 4.7 x 4.3 x 7.7 cm in AP, transverse and craniocaudal dimension respectively.  It is homogeneously bright on T2/STIR images.  There is a thin fat rind surrounding the tumor seen best on T1.  There is intramuscular edema at the cranial and caudal poles of the tumor seen best on fluid sensitive sequences.  Ultrasound images demonstrate a lesion which is hypoechoic relative to adjacent skeletal muscle and heterogeneous with a well defined margin.  Increased through transmission is noted.

The patient is a 56-year-old woman, with a significant history of thymus cancer and metastasis, treated with radiation 15 years prior.  Five months prior to seeking treatment, she incidentally noticed a mass along the medial aspect of her distal thigh.  The lesion is stable in size over five months, and is not associated with any pain.  She denies any trauma to or infection of the area.  She denies any fevers, chills, night sweats, or unexpected weight loss.
