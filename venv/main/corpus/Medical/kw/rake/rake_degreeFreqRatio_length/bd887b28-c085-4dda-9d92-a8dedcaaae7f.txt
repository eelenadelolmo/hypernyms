Air Contrast BE reduced the intussusceptum and the patient became immediately assymptomatic.  Because the risk of recurrence is highest in the first 24 hours, the child was monitored without recurrence during this time.
Plain films of the abdomen suggest a soft tissue mass with a cresent sign in the ascending colon.  There is also small bowel air in the expected location of the cecum.

US demonstrated a classic pseudokidney and target sign in the region of the right colon.
