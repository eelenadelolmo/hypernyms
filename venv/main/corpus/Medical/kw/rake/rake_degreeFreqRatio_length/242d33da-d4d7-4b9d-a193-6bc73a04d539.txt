Texto: 
Neck:  No adenopathy
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Patient had surgical margins positive for neoplasia.  Plan is for adjuvant radiation therapy.
Chest x-ray:  Asymmetric soft tissue density in the right apex with erosion of ribs.
Spindle Cell Sarcoma
Malignancy (primary or secondary)
Granulomatous disease
Infection
Hematoma
Incidental finding on a chest x-ray.  History of back pain after a motorcycle accident.  No history of right upper extremity or chest pain.  No constitutional symptoms.
Asymmetric soft tissue density in the apical regions of the lungs are an ominous sign and suggestive of neoplasia in a Middle aged individual.  The prior radiograph from 2 years prior demonstrated no lesion/opacity in that location.
