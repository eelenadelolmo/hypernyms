Obese female in no apparent distress with facial and bilateral upper extremity edema.  WBC = 2.9 x103 per &#956;L.
This patient was treated with local thrombolysis via catheter infusion of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) as well as multiple percutaneous transluminal angioplasties (PTA) over the course of 3 days.  Ultimately endovascular mechanical thrombectomy in combination with PTA yielded the final result.
Frontal CXR – Central venous catheter placement with tip in the region of the SVC.  Absent right breast shadow consistent with past mastectomy.  Widened superior mediastinum, right greater than left, in the region of the azygos vein.  

Axial CT w/contrast at the level of the aortic arch – homogeneous filling defect in the SVC.

Venography (initial) – This demonstrates occlusion of the right brachiocephalic vein with complete absence of opacification inferior to obstruction as well as opacification of a dilated azygos vein collateral.

Venography (final) – This demonstrates reconstitution of flow through the right brachiocephalic vein into the SVC without backfilling of collateral vessels.
SVC Syndrome secondary to central catheter-related venous thrombosis.
Given radiographic findings, differential considerations would include lymphoma, infectious process, non-infectious granulomatous disease (sarcoid), and venous thrombosis.  CT confirms thrombosis in the SVC and venography confirms consequent SVC syndrome.
This 43 yo woman presented with a 5-day history of bilateral facial, neck, and upper extremity swelling, as well as episodes of dizziness and syncope.
This patient was diagnosed with poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal carcinoma and subsequently treated with a right modified radical mastectomy approximately 4 months prior to current admission.  A right-sided indwelling central catheter had been in place for approximately 3.5 months and the patient was status-post 6 cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) chemotherapy.
