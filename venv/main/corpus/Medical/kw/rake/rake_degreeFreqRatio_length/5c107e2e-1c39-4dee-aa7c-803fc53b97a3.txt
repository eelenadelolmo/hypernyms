Texto: 
large, palpable, tender mass in R neck, posterior to the mandible.
Recommended followup includes placement of PPD, check HIV status, and FNA of the mass if any clinical suspicion of neoplastic process.  
Standard poly-pharmacy treatment for m. Tuberculum infection is usually therapeutic.
large heterogeneous mass posterior to R mandible, displacing adjacent structures.
Multiple necrotic appearing nodes in anterior cervical chains
Scrofula - Infectious cervical lymphadenitis
Infection/abcess
  TB
  Atypical Mycobacterium (usually not painful)
  Staph/Strep (would expect these with sicker, febrile presentation)
  If immune status is in question, the infectious differential expands to include many others especially fungal.

Lympho-proliferative
  Lymphoma
  Sarcoid
  zebras including Castleman's and Kimura's diseases.

Malignancy -- location is good for primary parotid tumor or oro-pharyngeal mets.

Benign neoplasm (Lipoma/Neuroma/Hemangioma)

Congenital (Branchial Cleft cysts)

Trauma/Vascular (no history) pseudo-aneurysm or A-V fistula.
30 y/o woman with 2 week history of painful neck mass.
Afebrile, and generally well appearing.
reports h/o mycobacterial infection in past.
