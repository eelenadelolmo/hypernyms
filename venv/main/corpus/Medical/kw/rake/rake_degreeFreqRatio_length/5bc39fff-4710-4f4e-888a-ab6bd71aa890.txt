None needed.
Multiple axial CT images through the liver demonstrate multiple, well-defined hypodense lesions.  On early arterial phase images, the masses demonstrate peripheral nodular enhancement with progressive filling-in from the periphery on portal-venous phase images.  Delayed images show prolonged enhancement.
Cavernous Hemangiomas
These findings are classic for hemangioma.  However, the differential for a solid liver mass includes:
-Metastases
-Hepatocellular carcinoma
-Fibrolamellar carcinoma
-Lymphoma
-Hepatic Adenoma
-Focal Nodular Hyperplasia
