Subtle decrease in mental status - No focal neurological defects
As burr holes and drains were already present, these were maintained with continued radiographic follow-up to ensure stability of the findings.
• Presentation Images
-Bilateral layering extraaxial fluid collections
-Mass effect with loss of sulci but no herniation

• Post-operative Images
-Interval bifrontal burr holes with drainage catheters
-Decrease in size of subdural hematoma with new pneumocephalus
-Increased mass effect on the frontal lobes bilaterally, L > R
-Widening of the interhemispheric space anteriorly
-New effacement of the left ambient and quadrigeminal plate cisterns
Tension Pneumocephalus - 'Mount Fuji Sign'
• Initial images show bilateral extraaxial (subdural) fluid
• Normal Post-Operative Changes
• Residual Subdural Hematomas
• Pneumocephalus
• Tension Pneumocephalus
80 year-old man with subtle personality changes and alteration in awareness 4 weeks after a minor bicycle accident, brought in by his family.
