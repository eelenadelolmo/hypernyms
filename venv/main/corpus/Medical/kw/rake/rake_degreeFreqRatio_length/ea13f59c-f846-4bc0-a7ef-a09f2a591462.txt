Abdominal distention.
Filling of the stomach was performed with an orogastric tube.  The stomach fundus, body, and antrum are unremarkable without evidence of mass lesion, mucosal abnormality or hiatal herniation. Contrast passes freely through the pylorus distending an unremarkable duodenal bulb and sweep.The ligament of Treitz is in normal position to the left of the lumbar spine and even with the duodenal bulb.  

The distal esophagus was filled with contrast via the orogastric tube. During filling of the esophagus contrast was noted to enter the trachea through a small tracheoesophageal fistula in the middle third of the esophagus.

2 day old male born at 35 weeks presents with food intolerance and abdominal distention.
The radiologist performing the upper GI study did not expect to find a fistula. Filling of the distal esophagus with contrast was performed and the catheter pulled in a cephalad direction toward the middle third of the esophagus where, unexpectedly, the trachea was opacified. 

Ultrasound studies of both the head and kidneys did not suggest other associated congenital (VACTERL) anomalies.
