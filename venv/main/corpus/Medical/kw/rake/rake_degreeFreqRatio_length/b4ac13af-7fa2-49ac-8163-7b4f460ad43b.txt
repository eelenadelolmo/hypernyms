An intradural extramedullary mass is seen at the T2 level measuring 1.2 cm AP x 1.1 cm transverse x 1.7 cm craniocaudad. This mass causes mild compression and leftward shift of the spinal cord. Subtle hyperintense T2 signal abnormality is noted within the mass, and uniformly enhances following gadolinium DTPA. There is a no dural tail. The spinal cord is normal in signal. No neural foraminal extension is seen.
Intradural Extramedullary Meningioma.

Schwannoma
Neurofibroma
Ganglioneuroma
Meningioma
Epidermoid
Dermoid
