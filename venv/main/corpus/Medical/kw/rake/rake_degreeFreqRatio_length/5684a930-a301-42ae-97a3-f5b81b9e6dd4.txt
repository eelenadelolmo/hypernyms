On physical examination, the right scrotum was exquisitely tender, and the right testicle was laterally oriented.
The patient was taken to the operating room for exploration, and the initial intraoperative finding was torsion of the right testis with a twisted right spermatic cord.
Grayscale and color Doppler sonography demonstrate a hypoechoic right testis in association with absent color Doppler flow.
Testicular Torsion
Testicular Torsion
33 y.o. man presented to the base emergency department (ED) with acute right testicular pain of six hours duration.
Deployed male military members may develop testicular pain for a number of reasons including infection, repetitive microtrauma from lack of supportive underwear, and from occupational work (e.g. driving vehicles on convoy duty).  As a consequence, they often seek medical care while deployed.   When presenting to the ED, one potential cause for their symptoms includes testicular torsion.  Any adult male service member can be affected regardless of age, and recurrent scrotal pain can occur before acute torsion.  As most medical facilities have ultrasound capability, the ability to assess the scrotum with ultrasound becomes important.

Torsion often results in the setting of an underlying anatomic anomaly (“bell clapper deformity”).  The inferior testis lacks an attachment to the inferior scrotum, and as a consequence, a twisted spermatic cord and testis may result. Grayscale ultrasound is helpful in assessing asymmetric testicular size, testicular edema, reactive fluid collections, and spermatic cord twisting; however, a normal grayscale exam does not exclude torsion. The key assessment is of testicular blood flow (both venous and arterial) with Doppler imaging.  

Venous obstruction is often the first hemodynamic change, followed by arterial obstruction and testicular ischemia.  Intermittent torsion and detorsion can also occur, which makes excluding the diagnosis of torsion unreliable with US alone.  When torsion-detorsion is suspected based on clinical presentation, comparison of the testicular echotexture and Doppler waveforms of the affected testis with the asymptomatic  testis may be beneficial.

When diagnosed within six hours, the testicular salvage rate is good (often > 75%).  Operative intervention is not entirely excluded in patients with pain duration greater than twenty-four hours, but salvage rates are low.  Occasionally patients can present days after torsion with subacute testicular infarction.  Occasionally, subacute (“missed”) torsion may go untreated and can be encountered years later (chronic torsion).
