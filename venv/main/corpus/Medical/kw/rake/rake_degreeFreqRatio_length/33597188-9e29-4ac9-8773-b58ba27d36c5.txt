Texto: 
Size of testicles symmetric on gross inspection.
No palpable mass.
Repeat Sonogram in 6 months was recommended.
Sonographic evaluation of the left testes demonstrates innumerable 1-2 mm, hyperechoic, non-shadowing foci diffusely scattered throughout the testicular parenchyma.
Testicular Microlithiasis
Post-granulomatous inflammation (Sarcoid, TB)
Post-vascular inflammation
Testicular Microlithiasis
‚ÄúBurned-out‚Äù germ cell tumor (usually large, smooth, curvilinear)
Sertoli Cell Tumor (usually large, smooth, curvilinear)
37 y/o male complains of decrease in size of left testicle over past 6 months.
Scrotal Calcifications maybe seen within the parenchyma of the testicle, on the surface of the testicle, or freely located within the fluid between the layers of the tunica vaginalis.  Large, smooth, curvilinear calcifications without an associated soft-tissue mass suggest a large cell, calcifying, Sertoli‚Äôs cell tumor, although occasionally ‚Äúburned out‚Äù germ cell tumors may have a similar appearance. Scattered calcifications may be found in tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, testicular microlithiasis, and scarring from regressed germ cell tumor or trauma.

Extratesticular calcifications arise from the surface of the tunica vaginalis and may break loose to migrate between the two layers of the tunica.  They have been called fibrinoid loose bodies or scrotal pearls because of their macroscopic appearance, which is usually rounded, pearly white, and rubbery.  They may result from inflammation of the tunica vaginalis or torsion of the appendix testes or epididymis.  Secondary hydroceles are common.
