Surgery and radiation therapy
• 3cm by 4cm mass right frontal lobe.
• Mass is hypointense on T2 and isointense on T1 weighted MRI scans.
• Mass is associated with intraaxial vasogenic edema.
• Mass enhances following contrast and has dural tail.
Metastatic disease from colonic carcinoma
• Meningioma
• Oligodendroglima
• Dural metastasis (breast cancer)
66 year old woman with known disease presents with new onset headache and unsteady gait.
This woman was known to have colon cancer.  The intracranial metastatic lesion simulated a frontal convexity meningioma.  It was not convincingly intra-axial and had associated with dural enhancement.
