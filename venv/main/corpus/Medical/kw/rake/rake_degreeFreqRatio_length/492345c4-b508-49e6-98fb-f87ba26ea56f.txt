Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 133/76, pulse of 93, and weight 133.5 pounds.   
No evidence of JVD.  
Cardiovascular: PMI is non-displaced.  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops. Carotid upstrokes are normal without bruits.  There are no pulsatile masses or abdominal aortic bruits noted.  The femoral arteries are 2+.  No bruits.  Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are 2+.  No evidence of peripheral edema.  
Respiratory:  Respirations are clear to auscultation with equal expansion.  
Extremities:  No clubbing or cyanosis of the extremities.
Recommendations:
1. Continue smoking cessation.
2. Continue Norvasc and recommended checking of blood pressure at least once a day.
3. Follow up in six to seven months or sooner as needed.

A followup study was performed one year later to evaluate for pulmonary emboli (CT of the chest), the findings within this study indicated:

There is reduced duration of a 2.5 x 2 cm well-defined fluid attenuation structure just inferior to the right inferior pulmonary vein. This is unchanged in size and imaging characteristics when compared to the study done one year earlier and is likely to represent a pericardial cyst. There are no further mediastinal/hilar lesions or nodules.

1. No PE/DVT detected. 
2. Unchanged presumed pericardial cyst in close relation to the right inferior pulmonary vein. 
3. Hypervascular liver lesions noted. These have not been definitively characterized but at least one appears relatively unchanged when compared to the prior study and consequently they are probably benign lesions such as hemangiomas.
AP X-ray due to Chest pain showed no specific criteria for pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 

MRI:
There is a 2.3 cm rounded lesion contiguous with the inferior margin of the right inferior pulmonary vein and the right larteral aspect of the left atrium.  It has fluid signal characteristics in all MRI sequences and is fluid density on CT.  It's cystic nature is confirmed.  This lesion requires no further follow-up.

This 57-year-old woman presents with substernal chest pressure. The patient states she had walked up a flight of stairs at work and developed substernal chest pain. Upon sitting, the pressure did not dissipate and she was taken to the ER by ambulance. She states the chest pain lasted approximately one hour and involved no nausea, no shortness of breath, nor any radiation. 

A stress test was performed and found to be negative. A nuclear scan showed no evidence of ischemia. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed and showed a left ventricle that appeared to have multiple striations. A cardiac MRI has been ordered to rule out ventricular non-compaction due to these findings.

The patient was discharged home and has felt well since this episode.
In this case, diagnosis was aided by the fact that the cyst was located well below the main bronchi.
