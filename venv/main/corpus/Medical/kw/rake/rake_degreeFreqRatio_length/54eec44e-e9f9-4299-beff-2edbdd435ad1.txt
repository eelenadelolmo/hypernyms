Texto: 
Gross deformation of the right ankle, swelling, ecchymosis, instability and pain.
Patient was referred to orthopedic surgery for open reduction and repair.
There is an obliquely-oriented, comminuted fracture through the distal fibula, nondisplaced medial malleolar fracture, and obvious external rotation / disloctation of the talus with respect to the mortise.  A posterior tibia fracture is also suggested on the lateral view, although position is admittedly suboptimal.
Lauge Hansen Stage IV Supination-External Rotation Fracture
Ankle Fracture-Dislocation
14 year-old adolescent who twisted ankle after jumping off curb.
The Lauge-Hansen classification provides a useful way to describe the radiographic findings in terms of the known mechanism of injury.
