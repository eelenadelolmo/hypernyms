CT: mass protruding from the left lambdoid suture

MR: large extra-axial mass, possibly arising from the tentorium which extends both superiorly and inferiorly, which is isointense on T1 to grey matter, avidly enhances with gadolinium, and demonstrates large internal flow voids. T2 imaging demonstrates a heterogeneous mass without cystic components.
