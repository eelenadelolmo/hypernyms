Active bleeding open wound, distal left thigh near knee.
The images are of a US serviceman who had a gunshot wound in the distal left thigh injuring the distal femoral artery and vein.  Hemorrhage control was obtained at the point of injury using a CAT tourniquet and topical hemostatic agents.  The patient was evacuated to a level II surgical facility where the injury was explored and the tourniquet removed after the transected vessels where controlled (just above and behind the left knee).  

Instead of prolonged vascular reconstruction at this forward location, the surgeons opted for an abbreviated operation using plastic temporary vascular shunts to bridge flow to the leg below the injury (see attached PDF on temporary vascular shunts and the image with the plastic tubes in the vessels).  This damage control maneuver took about 45 minutes and the patient was evacuated to a higher level of care with a perfused extremity.

Upon arrival to the level III surgical facility the patient&#39;s left leg was wrapped and tourniquets were in place as a safety measure in case the shunts had been dislodged during transport (see image of wrapped left lower extremity).  The patient went to the operating room at the level III surgical facility where the injury was explored, the temporary vascular shunts which were patent with flow were removed and a formal vascular reconstruction using contralateral saphenous vein was performed (see completion images of the saphenous vein repair of the distal femoral artery and vein and an image gently elevating these vascular grafts so one can see the whole through the other side of the lateral thigh and the green operating room floor through the leg).
Serial images demonstrate:
1) admission (tourniquets) and dressing
2) exploration of wound
3) temporary plastic shunts in place for transfer to next level of care
