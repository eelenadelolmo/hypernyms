Physical exam revealed decreased breath sound, poor ventilation, and expiratory wheezing.  Laboratory assessment (CBC, Chem) were unrevealing.  Prior labs revealed no hormonal abnormalities.
Progression of imaging findings is compatible with worsening metastatic disease from paraganglioma.  The original site of tumor (head+neck, adrenal, extra-adrenal) has not been confirmed, but no adrenal lesion was discovered.  A laryngeal lesion was found recently, but this may also be metastatic.  The chest lesions have not been biopsied due to concern for bleeding -- but they are presumed to be metastatic in nature.   The patient has had radiotherapy to the spine (which has partially improved multilevel degenerative disc abnormalities).  Chest radiation is being considered.
CXR reveals multiple pulmonary nodules.  There is also a large middle mediastinal mass encasing the trachea.  Chest CT reveals that the mass is hypervascular in its periphery, with the center of the mass being hypovascular and potentially partially calcified.
Metastatic Paraganglioma
• Vascular mass - hemangioma, angiosarcoma, partially thrombosed aneurysm
• Neoplasms - metastatic hypervascular tumors (Thyroid, HCC, Melanoma, Breast, RCC, Neuroendocrine tumors, sarcomas)
• SVC Syndrome with vascular collaterals simulating a hypervascular lesion, making lung cancer, lymphoma, and other hypervascular lesions a possibility.
73 yo man with COPD and chronic back pain from degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis. He presents today with shortness of breath to the ER.  CXR and Chest CT were performed during the workup and are shown in figures 1 and 2.  Comparison chest CTs (not shown) revealed only mild progression of the findings over the past 5 years.

PMH is significant: more than a decade earlier, a routine CXR showed multiple pulmonary nodules and a mediastinal mass was evaluated by CT.  Gallium scan at that time was positive.  Nine years prior, he presented with worsening back pain and was found to have an osteolytic lesion at the L3 vertebral body.  Biopsy was performed identifying the diagnosis.
Paraganglioma is uncommon, and metastatic paraganglioma is rare.  Most primary lesions are in the head+neck, adrenal gland, or paraspinal.  These hypervascular tumors are usually slow growing and usually non-malignant, but treatment is needed as the 5-year survival can drop to 20%.  In the past, surgical resection (perhaps with prior embolization by IR) was the definitive treatment, but recent treatment has focused on radiotherapy.  5-year survival rates with treatment can be above 75%.  In the setting of widespread metastatic disease, 5-year survival rates may drop to 36%.
