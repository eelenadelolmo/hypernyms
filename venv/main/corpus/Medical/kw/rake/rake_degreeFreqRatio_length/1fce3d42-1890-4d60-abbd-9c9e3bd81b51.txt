Patient was afebrile with a respiratory rate in the 40's and an O2 sat of 91% on room air.  Patient visibly tachypneic with nasal flaring and retractions.  Breath sounds were diminished on the right side.  

CBC within normal limits.
During the inital hospital course patient was managed medically to stabilize for surgery.  She required supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and an NG tube was placed for feeding.  Patient did very well and surgery was performed to correct the defect at 10 days of life without complication.
Frontal and lateral radiograms demonstrated a large mass in the posterior right hemithorax with shifting of the cardiac structures to the left.

MRI showed a 5 cm defect in the posterior right hemidiaphragm with herniation of the liver into the right hemithorax.
Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia - Right Bochdalek
Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia
Pulmonary Sequestration
Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation
Bronchogenic Cyst
2 day old term female, with routine prenatal course born via uncomplicated vaginal delivery, who presented with respiratory distress.
Congenital diaphragmatic hernias occur in 1 out of every 2500 births with a higher incidence in males.  The most common CDH is the posterolateral Bochdalek hernia which usually occurs on the left side in 85-90 percent of cases.  They typically present in the first 24-48 hours of life as respiratory distress and can be diagnosed on chest xray by visualizing multiple air filled loops of bowel in the left hemithorax.  In our case, the presentation was atypical as the defect was right-sided and initally appeared as a chest mass.  Preliminary considerations included pulmonary sequestration versus congenital cystic adenomatous malformation however, with further imaging we were able to discern that the mass was not cystic in nature as we would expect with CCAM. Furthermore, it did not appear to have an anamolous blood supply as often seen with pulmonary sequestration.  Diagnosis was confirmed by MR which showed herniation of the liver into the right hemithorax through 5 cm defect in the posterior right hemidiaphragm.  In approximately 50% of cases, the defect is diagnosed on routine prenatal ultrasound although this figure is actually lower for right sided bochdalek hernias.  The mortality rate for CDH remains high at 25-30% and it is considered to be one of the leading causes of surgical emergency in the neonate.  In some cases it has been reported that right sided defects are associated with a worse prognosis as the liver causes more of a mass effect leading to greater pulmonary hypoplasia.  This however was not the case with our patient who remained quite stable prior to surgery and recovered without incident.
