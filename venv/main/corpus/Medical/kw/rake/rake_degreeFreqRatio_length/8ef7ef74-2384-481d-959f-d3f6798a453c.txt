Bulge of left anterior arm, exaggerated by elbow flexion.
Long head biceps brachii tendon rupture with distal retraction. 
High signal intensity is present along bicipital groove (proximal long head tendon path).
Biceps Brachii tendon long head rupture
• Rotator cuff tear (vs proximal biceps tendon rupture)
• Superior labrum tear (vs proximal biceps tendon rupture)
• Brachialis muscle injury (vs distal biceps tendon rupture)
