1. Nuclear Cardiology Procedure - Twenty minutes following injection of Tl-201 at rest, a single photon computed tomographic (SPECT) image of the myocardium was acquired.  After review of the patient's blood pressure, cardiac and respiratory 
findings, and ECG the adenosine infusion was initiated. Following the second minute of the adenosine infusion, the Tc-99 tetrofosmin was injected. Thirty minutes later, an R-wave gated SPECT image of the myocardium was acquired. Images were reviewed on a computer monitor using contrast manipulation techniques and functional imaging correlation.

2. Cardiac Monitoring - During the infusion of adenosine, the patient's heart rate increased by 6 bpm and the systolic blood pressure decreased by 9 mmHg. Symptoms or side-effects of mild shortness of breath were observed. The baseline ECG revealed LBBB (pacer and defibrillator in place).  The adenosine ECG revealed LBBB with frequency PVCs.
This patient has history of remote CABG but no recent functional imaging before the current study.  While a non-reversible perfusion deficit by dual radioisotope nuclear cardiology may prompt a viability study in some patients, the presence of a calcified ventricular aneurysm precludes viability of the myocardium.
1. The perfusion images reveal severe perfusion deficits of the apex, septum (base to apex), anterior wall (apex to mid), inferior septal wall (apex to base) and inferior apical wall of the left ventricular myocardium.  None of these defects is reversed on rest images. Left ventricule is fixed and dilated. There is severe global hypokinesis with akinesis of the septum. The left ventricular ejection fraction is calculated at 14% (normal: >45%), which corresponds with the visual estimate. Different color schemes allow for alteration of the sensitivity and specificity of the study for myocardial perfusion defects.

2. Circular calcification of the left ventricular wall consistent with a calcified ventricular aneurysm.
