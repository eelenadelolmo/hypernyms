Physical Exam and Laboratory: 
Pleural effusion has a high lipid content
Treatment and Follow-up: 
Treatment includes oxygen therapy, medical or surgical pleurodesis, and estrogen lowering therapies.  Most commonly, patients will receive a bilateral oophorectomy; otherwise, depot progesterone, tamoxifen, or LHRH analogs may be used.  Currently, a trial using rapamycin which inhibits tuberin formation is being studied for LAM and tuberous sclerosis.  In end-stage lung disease, lung transplantation becomes necessary for survival.  In a few rare instances, allograft lungs have succumbed to LAM through hematogenous spread.
Patients with LAM are advised not to fly or travel to areas of high altitude to reduce the risk of pneumothoraces.  They are discouraged from becoming pregnant as this can lead to a high estrogen state that accelerates disease.
Image Findings: 
CXR:  This patient has a large, dense pleural effusion in right lower lobe and a bilaterally diffuse mild linear reticular pattern.
CT:  This patient has cystic air pockets throughout all lung fields and a dense pleural effusion in the right lower lobe.
Pulmonary Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)
Differential Diagnosis for these findings in this case:
Pulmonary Lymphangioleiomyomatosis, Tuberous Sclerosis, Eosinophilic Granuloma (Langerhans histiocytosis), Emphysema, Cystic Fibrosis, Bronchiectasis, Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, Neurofibromatosis (Types 1 and 2), Metastatic Leiomyosarcoma, Metastatic Leiomyoma, Metastatic Endometrial Stromal Tumor, Diffuse Pulmonary Lymphangiomatosis
History (can include gestational age, or age in days, weeks, months):
48 year-old female with history of lung disease with recurrent pneumothoraces
Though not given in this case, symptoms of dyspnea and cough are most common.  Others include hemoptysis and chest pain.
Discussion (include references): 
This rare disease occurs in women of childbearing age, mostly Caucasians.  It is caused by proliferating smooth muscle in the interstitium.  Although not cancerous, it can metastasize to other parts of the body.  It is estimated that there may be a 1,000 women with this disease in the United States.  The NIH follows the, approximately, 350 known patients.  Many patients are misdiagnosed with asthma or COPD.
Though idiopathic, it is closely related to tuberous sclerosis.  In fact, some believe that it may possibly be an attenuated or mosaic presentation of tuberous sclerosis.  Unlike tuberous sclerosis, there are no brain or skin lesions.  The progression of disease has been clinically linked to estrogen levels.
Complications include spontaneous pneumothraces (50%), which may be bilateral or recurrent, renal angiomyolipomas (hamartomas, 50%), hematothorax, chylothorax, chyloperitoneum, chylouria, and chylopericardium.
Classically, LAM entails a 8-10 year survival rate, but patients may now live for 20-50 more years with treatment.
