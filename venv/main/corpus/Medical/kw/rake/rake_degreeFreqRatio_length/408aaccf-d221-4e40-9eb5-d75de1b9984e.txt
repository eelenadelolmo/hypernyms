The patient was scheduled for follow-up with gastroenterology for upper endoscopy.  Treatment of a Schatzki ring is ballon dilatation.
Single contrast barium esophagram demonstrating a smooth circumferential, annular constriction at the distal esophagus proximal to a small hiatal hernia.  A small outpouching of contrast along the posterior aspect of the ring may represent a small ulcer or diverticulum.  The patient was observed swallowing a 13mm barium tablet which passed through the ring.
