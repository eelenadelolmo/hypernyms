The patient was scheduled for follow-up with gastroenterology for upper endoscopy.  Treatment of a Schatzki ring is ballon dilatation.
Single contrast barium esophagram demonstrating a smooth circumferential, annular constriction at the distal esophagus proximal to a small hiatal hernia.  A small outpouching of contrast along the posterior aspect of the ring may represent a small ulcer or diverticulum.  The patient was observed swallowing a 13mm barium tablet which passed through the ring.
Schatzki ring
Schatzki ring associated with hiatal hernia.
34 year old man with a long history of intermittent dysphagia for solid foods referred by gastroenterology for an upper GI and barium swallow prior to endoscopy.
This patient's Schatzki ring was associated with a small hiatal hernia.  There was also a small outpouching of contrast consistent with a small ulceration or diverticulum.  Upon further questioning the patient states he does experience episodic reflux symptoms.
