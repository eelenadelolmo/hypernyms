Texto: 
Physical exam was remarkable for mild erythema of the medial aspect of the left knee, tenderness to palpation at the medial joint space, pain on flexion and extension, no locking. Pt is able to ambulate.
Pt will be observed for changes suggestive of malignancy.
Radiographic images demonstrated normal anatomy.
MRI demonstrated a left MCL injury
Incidental finding on MRI demonstrated a 13x18mm mass located centrally in the left distal femoral metaphysis. It had distinct borders, did not extend to cortical bone, and was well circumscribed. There were no calcifications noted.
Enchondroma
bone infarct
enchondroma
The patient is a 31 year old AAF who, after twisting her knee while running, initially presented with a one month history of focal pain and stiffness to the medial aspect of the left knee. During workup, an enchondroma was identified on MRI.
A benign neoplasm composed of ectopic cartilage rests that have migrated into bones’ metaphysis from the growth plate.  Unless the patient has an enchondromatosis syndrome, these tumors rarely progress to chondrosarcoma. Occasionally, the tumor will cause a pathologic fracture which necessitates curretage of tumor in order to restore structural integrity of the bone. In cases without pathologic fracture, or melignant transformation, the treatment of choice is observation.
