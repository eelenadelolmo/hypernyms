Incomplete (Greenstick) Fracture of the right clavicle
Incomplete (greenstick) fracture of right clavicle. 
Right shoulder dislocation. 
Fracture of right humerus.
2 year old girl fell from couch and landed on shoulder. Cried for 1 hour continuously, while grabbing at shoulder. Child was rushed to the Emergency Department.
The common name for an incomplete fracture is "greenstick" fracture because of the similarity of appearance to bending a fresh branch off of a tree or a "green stick". 

Greenstick fractures typically occur in children because their bones are still developing and are not as rigid as adult bones. Long bones, such as the clavicle have most of their strength in the cortices. When the force is applied to fracture one cortex and the other side does not fracture, then it is called a "greenstick" fracture. A variant of this is the "torus" fracture.

For the clavicle, treatment of a greenstick fracture may be very conservative -  leaving the fractures alone because children's bones remodel rapidly. Another option includes immobilization by placing the patient's arm in a sling, reducing the fracture, or placing the child in a 3-point pressure cast for 3-6 weeks.
