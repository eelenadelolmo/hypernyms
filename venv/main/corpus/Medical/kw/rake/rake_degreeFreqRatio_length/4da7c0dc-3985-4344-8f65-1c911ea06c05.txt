Physical examination disclosed the patient to be alert but oriented only to person. There was a Marcus Gunn pupil on the left while the right pupil was normally reactive. The left eye was blind and there was a visual field cut on the right. There was no papilledema. The patient had anosmia. Cranial nerves 3 through 12 were intact. Strength was 5/5 throughout. The sensory examination to light touch was intact. The deep tendon reflexes were 2+ and the toes were down going.
Extensive lobulated suprasellar mass, largely homogeneous and of nearly water attenuation.
Suprasellar epidermoid cyst
<li>Craniopharynioma
<li>Epidermoid inclusion cyst
<li>Rathke cleft cyst
<li>Dermoid inclusion cyst
This 47 year old man had a history of organic brain syndrome and blindness in the left eye for one year. He presented to the emergency department following the new onset of a seizure. He had headaches, weakness or sensory abnormalities.
