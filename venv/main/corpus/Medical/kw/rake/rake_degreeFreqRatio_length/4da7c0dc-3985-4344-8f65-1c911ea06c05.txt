The left eye was blind and there was a visual field cut on the right. There was no papilledema. The patient had anosmia. Cranial nerves 3 through 12 were intact. Strength was 5/5 throughout. The sensory examination to light touch was intact. The deep tendon reflexes were 2+ and the toes were down going.
Extensive lobulated suprasellar mass, largely homogeneous and of nearly water attenuation.
