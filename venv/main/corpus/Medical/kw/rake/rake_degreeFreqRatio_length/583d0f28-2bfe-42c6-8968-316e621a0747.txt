PET:

An irregular region of uptake about the junction of the upper and lower outer quadrants of the left breast has a maximum SUV of 5.3, compatible with the clinical history of primary inflammatory carcinoma of the breast. Two foci about the upper outer quadrant / axillary tail / lower axillary lymph node region of the left breast have maximum SUVs of 2.8 and 2.3.  A nodule in the upper axillary region has a maximum SUV of 2.0.  An approximately one cm nodule at the anteroinferior aspect of the liver about the mid clavicular line with an SUV of 3.7 appears to correspond with the description of the recently CT-detected lesion.  No abnormal uptake is identified within the lungs or other extrahepatic tissues to suggest specifically metastatic disease.  Physiologic uptake is present at the brain, heart, kidneys,
bladder, skeletal and smooth muscles.

IMPRESSION:

1. Primary neoplasm at the left breast with possible satellite lesions, lymph node metastases or reactive lymph nodes about axillary tail region.

2. Nodal uptake at axillary region with minimal hypermetabolism, favor reactive lymph node, but metastatic disease is possible.

3. Focal hypermetabolic lesion of liver correlating with CT abnormality, suspicious for metastatic disease.


U/S:

A solid 2.5 cm hypoechoic mass at the anterior aspect of the medial segment of the left lobe of the liver.
