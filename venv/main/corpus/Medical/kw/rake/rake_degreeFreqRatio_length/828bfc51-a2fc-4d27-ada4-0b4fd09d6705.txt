Vital signs: Temperature 38.5, heart rate 137, respiratory rate 24, blood pressure 101/69, O2 sat 97% on room air.

Gen: NAD, alert, awake, and smiling playing video games.
Pulm: Absent breath sounds on right middle and right lower lobes.  No retractions.

Lab: WBC 21.4
Patient was started on 03-100A COG Soft tissue sarcoma protocol with 6 cycles of VAC.  Patient underwent lobectomy midway through chemo treatments and following chemo received post-op radiation therapy.
Large  irregular  density  in  the  region  of  the  right  middle  lobe  which  measured  approximately  10  cm  in  its  greatest  diameter with pleural effusion at time of presentation.  This would be consistent with Type III PPB.  Subsequent imaging following chemotherapy showed a good response to therapy with little tumor remaining 4 months into treatment.
Pleuropulmonary Blastoma
• Empyema with necrosis
• Ewing's sarcoma
• Askin tumor
• Neuroblastoma
• Rhabdomyosarcoma
This is the case of a 5-year-old male who presented to ED with complaints of respiratoy distress and fever for the past week.  Patient had presented to primary care physician the prior week for cough and fever with suspician for right sided pneumonia and was given Zithromax.  The patient finished this course two days prior to presentation in ED with symptoms having failed to improve.  PMH is significant for eczema and asthma treated with albuterol.  PSH, Meds, All, FmH, SocH, and ROS are all non-contributory other than mentioned above.
Patient has been followed hematology-oncology extensively and continues to do well at 2.5 years after diagnosis.
