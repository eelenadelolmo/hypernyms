At the L3-L4 level there is mild posterior disc bulge and mild bilateral posterolateral asymmetric disc bulges slightly more prominent on the left with encroachment into inferior aspects of both neural foramina resulting in mild neural foramina narrowing bilaterally, worse on the left.  There is mild effacement of anterior epidural fat planes which flattens the ventral aspect of the thecal sac, combined with bilateral facet joint arthropathy and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy resulting in central canal stenosis.  At the L4-L5 level there is a broad-based central disc herniation asymmetric to the right and posterolateral edge with encroachment into the inferior aspects of both neural foramina, worse on the right leading to moderate neural foramina narrowing on the right and mild on the left.  At the L5-S1 level there is a broad-based central disc herniation measuring approximately 6mm in AP dimension. There is encroachment into inferior aspects of both neural foramina by the bulding/protruding disc material leading to mild neural foraminal narrowing on the right and moderate on the left with impingements of left exiting L5 nerve roots.

Patient A is a 53 year-old African American female without significant past medical history who was a participant in a motor vehicle crash 6 months prior.  She reported that she was a front-seated, restrained passenger in a moving vehicle that was struck by another vehicle traveling less than 50 miles per hour, with impact occurring at the front of the vehicle she was seated in.  She endorses striking a solid object within the vehicle at the moment of impact, making contact with her chest.  At the time of the accident she did not lose consciousness or draw blood, but did note bruising on her lower left extremity but not on her chest.  In the months subsequent to her accident she has experienced pain in her chest, neck, shoulder blades, lower left back and lower left extremity.  Additionally, she states that after her trauma she has had intermittent dyspnea and headaches. She states that her back pain is most severe (9/10, “sharp”) when she is ambulating and sitting erect in a chair.  She states that she is not able to walk more than 10 feet without experiencing pain.  Rest seems to alleviate her pain, but she does state that laying supine for more than 3-4 hours will aggravate her symptoms, limiting her sleep at night.  She states that prescribed NSAIDs did not do much in terms of relieving her pain.  In addition to bilateral wrist pain, she also states that she has numbness and tingling radiating distally into her hands and fingers (left >right).  She states that she does experience some pain shooting down to her left knee but that it is intermittent in nature.  She denies bowel and/or bladder incontinence and denies saddle anesthesia.  Her headaches are intermittent in nature and located mainly in her right temporal region.  Her headaches have been accompanied by nausea and photophobia at times, but not phonophobia.  She was in her normal state of health without most of these symptoms prior to her motor vehicle accident, but does state she has always had some left knee pain even before the incident.  She does endorse a greater intensity in her left knee, however, since the crash.  Functionally, she has had difficulty performing her activities of daily living on her feet and also has not been able to work given the physical aspects of her job as a CNA.
 
Her past medical history is significant only for hypertension, as she denies diabetes/kidney disease/heart disease or any other chronic illnesses.  Her only medications are nifedipine and triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide for her high blood pressure.  She denies any allergies.  She denies any other motor vehicle accidents or athletic injuries, but does state that she had a work injury occurring in the early 1990s, whereby she was carrying a heavy box into a storage room and turned “the wrong way” and injured her left knee.  She put off surgery until the pain became unbearable and she underwent reconstructive left knee surgery later in the 1990s.  Her only other surgery was a thyroidectomy in 1998.  Her family history is significant for liver disease, heart disease, and lupus.  She is employed part-time as a Certified Nursing Assistant and lives at home independently.  She denies alcohol use and is a one pack-per-day smoker.
 
B
Patient B is a 32 year-old African American male without a significant past medical history that was involved in a motor vehicle accident occurring approximately 7 months prior.  During this episode, he alleges that he was at a gas station and was standing outside of the driver-side door and was leaning into the front of the car to vacuum the interior.  While doing this, another car, driving approximately 20-30 mph hit his car head on.  During the collision the steering wheel of his car struck his left hip and he was “jolted” further into the car with his head landing on the passenger seat.  The steering wheel collapsed around his left hip, bending it and leaving a concavity.  He denied a loss of consciousness or loss of blood but stated that his back and left hip hurt immediately following the crash.  He did not initially seek medical attention, but stated that after two days the pain became increasingly severe so we went to a local hospital.  While at the hospital he underwent X-ray studies, which were negative and he was discharged with a prescription for muscle relaxants. He noted that for several days after the trauma, he did have a bruise on his right shin.  In the months following this vehicular accident, he has continued to have persistent mid-to lower lumbar pain with some pain radiating to the left hip and buttock region, as well as pain intermittently radiating distally to the left knee.  On average he rates the pain as 4/10 but at its worst it peaks at 7/10.  He describes the pain as “sharp”.  He states that his pain is aggravated by ambulation (especially walking up and down inclines) and laying supine for long periods of time.  He denies bowel and/or bladder incontinence as well as no saddle anesthesia.  He no longer is experiencing pain in his right shin or in any other parts of his body aside from his back and hip.  He is currently not taking any medications for his pain.  His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable. 
 
His past medical history is insignificant for any chronic illnesses, as he denies diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease and he does not take any medications.  He denies any allergies.  He does have a significant previous trauma, however, occurring when he was 14 years old.  At this time, a car struck him and his lower body was pinned against another vehicle, which “crushed” his left tibia and fibula.  As a result he underwent reconstructive surgery with skin grafts and abdominal muscle transfer; he was hospitalized for one month and could not walk for approximately one year after with physical therapy.  He does not suffer any significant neuromuscular sequelae from this accident, aside from minor sensory loss, scarring, and left knee pain after a hard day on his feet.  His family history is significant for ovarian cancer, heart disease and diabetes.  He works as an electrician and is currently out of work.  He smokes half a pack of cigarettes per day and drink “socially”.  He denies illicit drug use.

While the mechanism and physics of the different imaging modalities differs, each offers specific advantages in detecting injury and damage to the musculoskeletal system.  While there are multiple imaging modalities, for musculoskeletal trauma the most utility appears to be gained from conventional radiography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. 
Conventional radiography is the initial imaging choice in most instances of musculoskeletal trauma evaluation.  Radiographs are particularly useful in detecting and screening for: fractures, periosteal reaction/healing, soft tissue calcification/ossification, localized bony lesions, placement of any orthopedic hardware, potential bone dysplasias or skeletal deformities.  This modality offers lower radiation doses compared to CT and is relatively inexpensive and universally available (1,2).  Unfortunately, plain X-ray films are not as sensitive in picking up certain musculoskeletal injuries, particularly hairline fractures and non-displaced fractures.  The dating of a fractures is also difficult on plain films, as it can take as long as 4-6 weeks to appreciate a fracture line (3).  Conventional radiography does not provide a high degree of contrast resolution between soft tissues, so assessing for ligamentous, meniscal, spinal cord, tendon, muscle injuries is difficult and often has to be inferred based on entities such as lipohemarthrosis or joint effusions.  An extension of conventional radiography, fluoroscopy, is useful in dynamically illustrating the motion of the musculoskeletal system under real-time (4).  Patient A benefited from fluoroscopic examination of her spine, using a DMX study.  The depiction of cervical flexion and extension allowed her to be diagnosed with ligamentous laxity of the posterior and anterior longitudinal ligaments.  While the X-ray of her knee was able to illustrate proper placement of previously placed orthopedic hardware from a previous surgery, it could not provide very much information on the soft-tissue structures within her knee, particularly the ligaments.  Patient B actually received an X-ray film two days after his motor vehicle accident but it failed to discover his compression fractures of his vertebral bodies.  This illustrates the insensitivity of radiography compared to CT in detecting early fractures. 
Unlike conventional radiography, CT allows different densities, such as air, fat, muscle, cortical bone, and cancellous bone to all be evaluated relative to each other.  Images can also be displayed within certain windows to best demonstrate air, soft tissues, or bone. Computed tomography is superior to X-rays and MRI in detecting subtle cortical disease, particularly small cortical or subchondral fractures.  Other advantages of CT include better characterization of soft tissue calcifications, detecting radiographically occult fractures, and evaluation of orthopedic hardware (5,6).  CT exams are fast, less claustrophobic to patients, and can be performed on patients with metallic implants.  Patient A received a CT scan of her thorax after being involved in a motor vehicle accident, which was able to detect an oblique fracture of her sternum.  Additionally, using a lung-window, an area of plate-like atelectasis and interstitial lung disease could be detected in her right middle lung, as well as an incidental angioma in her liver.  This illustrates the powerful ability of CT to detect multiple different tissue densities.  Patient B received a CT scan of his lumbar spine after his trauma and two vertebral compression fractures were found and characterized, as well as neural foramina and canal diameters based on bone window measurements.  While this was useful information, the CT could not provide any information on the healthy of his spinal cord, spinal ligaments, or paraspinal muscles. 
Over the past couple of decades, magnetic resonance imaging has become the superior mode of anatomic imaging in the clinical arena.  The high contrast resolution provides immense detail of anatomic structure, allowing even the subtlest damage or injury to be found. The most important clinical utility of MRI is its ability to evaluate non-calcified soft tissues.  For the musculoskeletal system, tissues such as menisci, articular cartilage, ligaments, tendons, and synovial fluid that are indistinguishable on radiography/CT can be seen MRI.  This imaging modality thus lends itself to soft tissue injuries in musculoskeletal trauma, particularly ligamentous injuries, cartilage damage, tendon and muscle disruption, and bone marrow changes.  An infinite number of reconstruction planes permit sagittal, axial, and coronal displays of complex soft tissue structures.  MRI is particularly sensitive in detecting subtle changes in water content of tissues, which often changes with inflammation, ischemia, trauma, and neoplasia.  Such changes within the medullary canal of bone can be clearly detected by MRI, so subtle trauma and even stages of healing can be elucidated (7).  A large majority of musculoskeletal trauma involves the spine and MRI is capable of assessing not only the integrity of vertebral bodies, but also the intervertebral discs, ligaments, and the spinal cord itself (8,9, 10).  Furthermore, the use of T2 fat suppressed and STIR sequences can detect bone marrow edema and contusions to help date fractures more accurately than X-ray or CT (11).  Both patient A and B benefited greatly from MRI in diagnosing their post-traumatic injuries.  Patient A’s cervical spine MRI confirmed the anterolisthesis and retrolisthesis seen on her DMX study, but also helped to rule out a cervical disk herniation that was one of her leading differential diagnoses.  Her lumbar spine MRI was able to identify two areas of disk herniation between L4-L5 and L5-S1 and measurements were obtained to elucidate if neural foramina were being narrowed, as it related to her symptomotology.  The MRI of her left knee further delved past the information provided by the X-ray and was able to detect soft tissue injury to her ACL and PCL but also to her lateral meniscus.  Patient B’s lumbar spine MRI further characterized his vertebral compression fracture, using bone marrow edema to determine that it was subacute in timing.  Additionally, the soft-tissue capability of his MRI ruled out serious spinal cord injury.  The MRI of his hip was able to detect a subtle tendinopathy and bursitis and imaging performed on his knee found a bone contusion on his left tibia with a subchondral cyst associated with it, as a result of his trauma.
