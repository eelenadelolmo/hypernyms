Antalgic gait, favoring left hip
Surgical pinning of the femoral neck is required to fix the epiphysis to the metaphysis and prevent further displacement.
There is asymmetric widening and indistinctness of the physis of the right proximal femur, with posteromedial rotation of the epiphysis.  On frogleg lateral projection, a line drawn along the lateral cortex of the metaphysis does not intersect the epiphysis.
