PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General - this is a slightly emaciated African-American male who appears dehydrated.  

Vital Signs - afebrile. 
 
Temperature 97.4, blood pressure 112/87, pulse 98, respiratory rate 18.
The patient was admitted and treated with ceftriaxone and Zithromax for a respiratory tract infection. After two days and multiple breathing treatments the patient was encouraged to stop smoking as quickly possible and discharged home.
Findings compatible with pulmonary artery hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
Differential Diagnosis of Enlarged Hila

· Adenopathy (Sarcoidosis, Lymphoma, Infection, Neoplasm)
· Malignancy (Primary or Secondary)
· Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
· Pulmonary Artery Aneurysm (Behcet's and other vasculidities)
This is a 51-year-old African-American male who has been recently diagnosed with pneumonia.  He also presented with acute neutropenia and nephrolithiasis, currently on the hospital's pneumonia pathway.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Tobacco use.  Denies IV drug abuse.
Common Findings on Chest radiograph in patients with PAH:
Enlarged main and hilar pulmonary arteries that taper rapidly toward the periphery
Enlargement of the right ventricle on lateral view(obliteration of retrosternal clear space.
Hypertension-induced atherosclerosis causes calcification in the pulmonary arteries (not common)

Criteria for pulmonary artery enlargement: 
Transverse diameter of proximal interlobar pulmonary arteries exceeding 16 mm on PA radiograph
Right interlobar PA greater than 25 mm is specific for Primary Pulmonary Hypertension

Defined as a pulmonary artery systolic pressure greater than 30/15 mm Hg. 

The etiology of primary pulmonary hypertension is unknown. 
Secondary pulmonary hypertension can be a complication of many pulmonary, cardiac and extrathoracic conditions. 

Cor pulmonale is enlargement of the right ventricle as a consequence of disorders of the respiratory system.
Pulmonary hypertension invariably precedes cor pulmonale. 
Unrelieved pulmonary hypertension, regardless of the underlying cause, leads to right ventricular failure. 

The estimated incidence of primary pulmonary hypertension is 1 to 2 cases per 1 million persons in the general population. 

Hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction and capillary obliteration occur in interstitial lung disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is the most common cause of pulmonary hypertension.   
  
Clinical Symptoms
Dyspnea 
Fatigue 
Chest Pain 
Exertional syncope 
Signs of right heart failure (JVD, ascites, hepatomegaly) 

Echocardiography is the most useful imaging modality for detecting pulmonary hypertension and excluding underlying cardiac disease. Confirmation of pulmonary hypertension is based on identification of tricuspid regurgitation. Right ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy are late findings. 

Cardiac catheterization should be performed in patients with unexplained pulmonary hypertension and remains the gold standard for its diagnosis and quantification. 

An easy way to memorize seconday causes of Pulmonary Artery Hypertension is through the mnemonic VICE

Vasculitis
Idiopathic (PPH)
Chronic emboli and Chronic lung disease
Emphysema and Eisenmenger's syndrome
