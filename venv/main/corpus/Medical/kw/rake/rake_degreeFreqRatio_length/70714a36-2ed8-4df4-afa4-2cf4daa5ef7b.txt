There was no evidence of shunt failure.  The patient was treated for a viral illness and discharged to home.
The plain film demonstrates open spinal processes including L5 and the entire sacrum.
The CT demonstrates a small posterior fossa with herniation of the cerebellar tonsils into the foramen magnum as well as a compressed fourth ventricle and a beaked tectum.  This constellation is seen in Chiari Two malformations.  There was no evidence of shunt failure.
Chiari Two Malformation
Without the additional findings of a neural tube defect these findings could be seen in a Chiari One malformation.
History of nausea and vomiting in a patient with a VP shunt and known history of neural tube defect.
The combination of a small posterior fossa and herniation of the cerebellar tonsils causes an obstructing hydrocephalus in patients with a Chiari malformation.  This is relieved with ventriculoperitoneal shunting.  Nausea and vomitting can be signs of raised intracranial pressure as a result of shunt failure.  No evidence of shunt failure is seen in this case.
