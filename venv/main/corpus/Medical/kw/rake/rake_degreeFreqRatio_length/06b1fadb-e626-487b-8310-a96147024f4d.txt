Unremarkable physical examination and laboratory findings.
No treatment is required for this benign condition unless the cyst becomes infected or enlarged-in that instance, surgical removal can be indicated.
Increased signal intensity is seen within the posterior nasopharynx on the sagital T1 image. Signal intensity is elevated secondary to the increased protein content of the cyst.
Tornwaldt or Thornwaldt Cyst
The differential diagnosis for this pharyngeal mucosal space mass also includes mucus retention cyst, squamous cell carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, lymphoma, or juvenile nasal angiofibroma.
42 y/o female complaining of chronic headaches.
