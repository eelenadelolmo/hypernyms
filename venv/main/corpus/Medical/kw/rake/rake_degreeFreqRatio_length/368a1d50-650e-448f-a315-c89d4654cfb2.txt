Essentially normal
resection
On T1W, there is a large and slightly heterogeneous high signal intensity lesion in the left lateral ventricle.  This lesion is dark on the T2W image with fat suppression.
Liponeurocytoma
• Choroid plexus neoplasm (papilloma or carcinoma)
• Ependymoma (with lipoblastic differentiation)
• Choroid plexus lipoma
• Meningioma with fat ("lipoblastic meningioma")
• Liponeurocytoma
• Xanthogranuloma of the choroid plexus
75 y.o. man with headaches
This patient is rather old for a primary choroid plexus neoplasm.  Both benign choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) and malignant choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) usually  present under the age of five (85% < 5 yrs).  Neurocytoma usually presents in middle age (mean of 50yrs).  Meningioma and xanthogranuloma present in older patients; and, choroid metastasis present in older patients.
