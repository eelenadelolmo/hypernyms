Multiple axial CT images obtained according to the CT pulmonary angiography protocol demonstrates mixed-density (including air density) endoluminal lesion within the bronchus intermedius extending from just past the carina and down, with large areas of atelectasis in the right lower lobe.  The air densities strongly suggest that this is a large mucus plug.

Oblique coronal reconstructed image shows the extent of this large mucus plug.
