Normal laboratory values.
No treatment is necessary for this mild anomaly of mullerian fusion.
Demonstrated on this hysterosalpingogram is a uterus with a smooth, arcuate appearance to the inner surface of the fundus. No internal septa are apparent. Free spillage of contrast is seen from each fallopian tube.
Arcuate Uterus
Arcuate uterus
29 year old female complaining of infertility.
This patient's complaint of infertility is probably unrelated to the arcuate appearance of the uterine fundus and is likely an incidental finding.
