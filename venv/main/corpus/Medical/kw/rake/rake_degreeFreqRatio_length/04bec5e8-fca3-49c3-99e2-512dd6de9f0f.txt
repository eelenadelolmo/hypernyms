Supportive care only.
The left cerebral hemispheric cortex is  severely thickened with broad gyri and shallow sulci. Heterotopias and gliosis are seen in the white matter. Both the heterotopia and gliosis appear as areas of prolonged T1 and T2 relaxation times. 

There is marked deformity of the left lateral ventricle and left to right shift due to the hamartomatous enlargement of the left cerebral hemisphere
Hemimegalencephaly
• Gliomatosis Cerebri
• Hemimegalencephaly
• Gliosarcoma

Cranial Ultrasound reveals left hemisphere, mass thought to be neoplastic.
Initial cranial ultrasound was interpreted as a large left hemisphere tumor.  MRI was required to make the actual diagnosis of hemimegalencephaly.
