The left cerebral hemispheric cortex is  severely thickened with broad gyri and shallow sulci. Heterotopias and gliosis are seen in the white matter. Both the heterotopia and gliosis appear as areas of prolonged T1 and T2 relaxation times. 

There is marked deformity of the left lateral ventricle and left to right shift due to the hamartomatous enlargement of the left cerebral hemisphere
