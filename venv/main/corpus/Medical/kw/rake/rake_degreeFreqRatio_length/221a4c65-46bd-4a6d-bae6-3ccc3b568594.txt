Exams: Thyroid, cardiovascular, lungs, and abdominal exams were normal.

Labs: 
CBC indicated normocytic anemia. 
Chemistry panel indicated the following abnormalities:
Glucose		SERUM	127 (H) 	
Urea Nitrogen	SERUM	33 (H)
Creatinine	SERUM	2.2 (H) 

PT,PTT,INR: Normal	
Feces Occult blood – Negative on 3 samples	
Helicobacter Pylori Antibody - Negative
Due to this patient’s Stage IV metastatic disease, surgery was not indicated. He was subsequently referred to Radiation Oncology for palliative treatment.
Barium Esophagram (Not pictured)
CONCLUSION:
Lower esophageal stricture.  This is most concerning for malignancy vs. possible peptic stricture.  Recommend GI consult for direct visualization.
   
CT Oncology: 
IMPRESSION:
Findings concerning for distal esophageal carcinoma with regional nodal metastases and possible lung metastases.  In particular, the juxtapleural speculated opacity in the left lower lobe may reflect an area of rounded atelectasis, pneumonia, or metastatic focus.  Correlate with pending PET scan.

PET CT:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Findings consistent with metabolically active mass in the distal esophagus with a maximum SUV of 13.  
2.  The left lower lung nodule is metabolically active with a max SUV of 5.1 consistent with metastatic disease.
3.  Multiple nodal metastatic disease involving subcarinal lymph node, left infrahilar lymph node and abdominal lymph nodes.
4.  Increased metabolic activity present in the left adrenal with a max SUV of 4.6 consistent with metastatic disease.
Squamous Cell Esophageal Cancer
Peptic stricture

Esophageal Carcinoma
61 y.o. man presented with dysphagia x 6 weeks with solid foods.  He was able to tolerate some liquid foods.  He had modified his diet due to these symptoms.  He had no other symptoms.  
PMHX: coronary artery disease requiring CABG – 2 vessel, HTN, DM Type I, Hyperlipidemia, chronic esophageal reflux. No history of smoking.  +30 year history of alcohol use.
Esophageal cancer is a GI malignancy with a predilection for males in the 6th-7th decades of life.  Worldwide, squamous cell carcinoma is more prevalent than adenocarcinoma.  However, in the U.S., the increased incidence of adenocarcinoma in white males has made it the most common esophageal malignancy.  Squamous cell carcinoma remains the most common type in African-American males.  

Two primary risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus have been identified in developed countries: alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking.  Presumably, it is for this reason that the most common location for squamous lesions are in the proximal and mid-portions of the esophagus.  In Asian countries, N-nitroso compounds found in smoked foods have also been implicated in squamous cell lesions.

Patients usually have no symptoms until late in the course of disease due to the compliance of the esophagus.  The first symptom is usually dysphagia or odynophagia to solid foods.  This means the disease is often quite advanced at diagnosis and therefore carries a very poor prognosis.   

Esophageal cancer is usually suspected after an abnormal barium esophagram conducted for dysphagia.  The addition of CT allows for further assessment of metastatic disease and regional invasion.  Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is often obtained when no evidence of metastatic disease exists to increase the accuracy of locoregional metastases and staging prior to surgery.  FDG-PET or FDG-PET CT may also be used when questions exist regarding distant metastasis.   It has been found in previous studies that PET is more accurate in detecting Stage IV disease than CT alone or in combination with EUS.
