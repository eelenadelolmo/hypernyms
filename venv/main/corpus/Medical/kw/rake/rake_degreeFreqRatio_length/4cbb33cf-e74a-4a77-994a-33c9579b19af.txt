Redness and warmth at skin site - reopened and explored to the level of the fascia.
Patient to continue dialysis until fitness for retransplantation established and a new donor organ is available.
Post-operative fluid collection at the allograft nephrectomy site without evident rim-enhancement to suggest abscess.  Kidneys are greatly enlarged by innumerable cysts with little remaining true renal parenchyma.  Some of the cysts are hyperdense and some are hypodense.  There are scattered smaller cysts in the liver.
ADPKD -Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease
• Multiple Simple Cysts
• Acquired Uremic Cystic Kidney Disease
• Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease
• von Hippel-Lindau
• Tuberous Sclerosis
51 year-old man with recent nephrectomy of allograft, cellulitis at the skin surgical site and concern for abscess.  Iodinated contrast as patient to receive dialysis following the exam.
ADPKD is rarely a diagnostic dilemna when patients present with gross hematuria and receive a CT scan.  However, younger patients will have a lower cystic burden and maintain renal function.  In this case, there was no prior imaging at our institution although the underlying case of renal failure was known to the clinicians.  The vast majority of end-stage renal disease we image is secondary to diabetic or hypertensive nephropathy and we see small atropic kidneys with small cysts in those cases.
