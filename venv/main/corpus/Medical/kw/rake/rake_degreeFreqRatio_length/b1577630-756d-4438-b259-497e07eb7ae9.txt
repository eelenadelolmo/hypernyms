The patient complains of left elbow pain.  There is no gross deformity or crepitus.
Reduction with splinting.
Lateral elbow demonstrates capitellum impacted into olecranon.  The exact location of the capitellum is obscured but the radiocapitellar line does not intersect the capitellum indicating dislocation.  Small bony fragments are seen anterior to the radial head indicating fracture.  Normal fat pad.
AP Elbow shows no obvious deformity.

Portable view of humerus demonstrates increased distance between the trochlea and trochlear notch.

Post reduction lateral elbow displays the impaction fracture.
