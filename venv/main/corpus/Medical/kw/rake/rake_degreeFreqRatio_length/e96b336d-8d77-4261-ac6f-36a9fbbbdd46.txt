Tc-99m DTPA study shows no activity within the brain.  Note the "hot nose" due to shunting of flow from the internal carotid to the external carotid system.  Also no visualization of major venous sinuses e.g. sagittal sinus, is clearly seen on this exam (although faint visualization does not exclude an assessment of "consistent with brain death".)
Findings consistent with brain death
75 y.o. male meeting clinical criteria for brain death
An adequate radiopharmaceutical dose and good bolus infusion are required to ensure a diagnostic flow study.  When the study is performed prorperly, flow to both common carotid arteries will be seen to the base of the skull.  The diagnostic finding is the lack of intracranial arterial flow.  This is because edema, softening, necrosis, and autolysis of brain tissue leads to increased intracranial pressure sufficient to overcome arterial pressure.
Often the "hot nose" sign is seen.  Diversion of flow from the intracranial to extracranial circulation results in relatively increased flow to the face and nose.
