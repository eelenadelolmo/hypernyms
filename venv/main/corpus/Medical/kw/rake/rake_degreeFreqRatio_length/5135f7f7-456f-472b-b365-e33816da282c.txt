An asymmetric tonsillar bulge (left larger than right) with displacement of the uvula is noted on physical examination.

WBC 18.7, HGB 11.9, HCT 34.8, PLT 624K, NEUT 71.4 %, LYMPH 20.1 %, MONO 6.6 %, EOS 1.5 %, BASO 0.4 %, MONO SPOT negative, RAPID STREP TEST positive.
Surgical drainage (needle aspiration or incision and drainage) and antibiotic therapy effective against group A Streptococcus. Tonsillectomy if there is failure to improve within 24 hours of antibiotic therapy and surgical drainage.
A lateral plain radiograph of the neck demonstrates a prominence of the soft tissues of the adenoids and palatine tonsils.  The epiglottis appears normal.

Intravenous contrast-enhanced axial computed tomographic images of the neck demonstrate a left-sided parapharyngeal mass of fluid density.  This collection is loculated with a single thick internal septation that enhances along with the peripheral walls of the lesion.
