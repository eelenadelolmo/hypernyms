Texto: 
- large well circumscribed 9.2 x 8.0 cm mass in left adnexa abutting the uterus
- predominantly fat containing ( negative HU) with fluid layering dependently
- calcified "tooth" at inferior extent--this is in the Rokitansky nodule
Mature cystic teratoma
22 y/o WF with incidental finding on initial work-up for presumed leukemia.
- no similar appearing lesions were seen in the right adnexa
- consideration for removal in light of possible ovarian torsion in the future
