Texto: 
Height is 75.8 cm (slightly above 25% for age)
Weight is 10.55 kg (50% for age)
Blood pressure was not obtained secondary to patient agitation

Pupils were equal and reactive to light and accommodation. There were no lesions in the oral mucosa. Four upper and lower teeth were present. Thyroid gland showed no enlargement and no nodularity. Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion. Abdomen was soft and bowel sounds were present. There was no hepatosplenomegaly and no masses were appreciated. Examination of the anterior chest revealed no breast tissue and nipples were infantile (Tanner I female). No estrogen effect on genital mucosa was appreciated. Labia minora were underdeveloped. The clitoris was enlarged and hooded, measuring 1.5 cm. Additionally, the clitorus was a dark red almost purplish color and was engorged. Pubic hair was Tanner II female. Several dark, long, and thick pubic hairs were present on the labia majora. Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ bilaterally and patient had good muscle tone. Two small hemangiomas were observed. No cafe-au-lait spots or petechia were appreciated.

Labs with reference normal values:

HVA, random urine 14.6 (8.5-38 mg/g creatinine)
VMA, random urine 8.9 (2.5- 21 mg/g creatinine)
Androstenedione 250 (8-50 ng/dL)
B-hCG <2 (<5 IU/mL)
Compound S 101 (20-155 ng/dL)
DHEA-Sulfate 500 (<5-57 ug/dL)
Estradiol 0.7 (<1.5 ng/dL)
FSH 0.8 (1-4.2 mIU/mL)
LH <0.2 (0.2-0.3 mIU/mL)
SHBG 203 (1.5-6.3 ug/dL)
17-Hydroxyprogesterone 85 (3-90 ng/dL)
Surgical resection of adrenal mass and life-time follow-up for possible relapse.
ULTRASOUND:     
       There is a lobulated mass within the right adrenal gland, which measures approximately 3.2 x 2.1 x 2.7 cm in size and has an echogenicity similar to renal cortex.  

BONE AGE:
      There are 34 ossification centers counted in the left hemiskeleton.  The expected number for a 15-month female is 28  +/-14. The bone age is between one and two standard deviations of the mean.
       
BONE SCAN:                                                       
    No focal area of abnormally increased or decreased tracer activity is detected in the axial or appendicular skeleton. Faint normal soft tissue activity is seen or the kidneys bilaterally with a small amount of tracer in the bladder. The bladder is drained by a catheter, however, and is not significantly distended. No abnormal activity is noted in the right suprarenal region to indicate activity in the right adrenal mass. This is a normal bone scan.
        
CT SCAN of ABDOMEN:   
There is a heterogeneous mass in the expected location of the right adrenal. This measures 4.1 x 2 x 2.2 cm.  The lesion has a heterogeneous attenuation, although calcifications cannot be definitely identified as contrast was provided. This mass does not appear to be extending into the kidney or the IVC.  It does compress the IVC a bit however. The uterus does appear to be enlarged for age.  Ovaries are not identified. Multiple inguinal lymph nodes are identified.    These are relatively plump in appearance, but none measure greater than 1 cm in maximal dimension.

       
Adrenocortical Carcinoma
In Children:
>> Adrenal Adenoma
>> Neuroblastoma
>> Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia
>> Metastatic Adrenal Deposits
Patient presented initially to pediatric endocrinology clinic at age 14 months with premature development of pubic hair. The patient was a product of a full term pregnancy delivered via C-section. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes as well as by a radioactive iodine treatment received by the mother for hyperthyroidism during her first few weeks of pregnancy. The patient was closely monitored after delivery and no further complications were noted. The patient has a vocabulary of several words and started to walk around 8 to 9 months of age. There has been no significant change in her growth rate.

The patient's mother has reactive airway disease, Type II diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypertension. The patient has two brothers, an 11-year-old and an 8-year-old who are both growing and developing well. There is no family history of hirsutism, ambiguous genitalia, or infertility.
In any patient with premature development of pubic hair and clitoral enlargement, two things must be considered: 1)adrenal androgen overproduction and 2)adrenal or ovarian tumor. The possibility of precocious puberty is less likely because clitoral enlargement is not a part of true precocious puberty. This patient's birth history adds an another important consideration, history of exposure to radioactive iodine during the first weeks of fetal life. 

Imaging studies are a key component of preoperative diagnosis. Size of the mass is an important criterion for estimating the probability of benign verses malignant disease.Imaging studies revealed that our patient had an adrenal mass measuring approximately 4.5 cm prior to resection. This large size made the tumor suspect for malignancy. 

Additionally, certain imaging features on CT are characteristic of carcinomas. Adrenal carcinomas are generally large tumors with high intensity and irregular margins or infiltration into other organs, while adenoms typically show a low radiological density with regular appearance and clear margins. Our patient's lesion had a heterogeneous attenuation on CT.

Our patient was diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinoma via imaging and histology. Since her tumor was less than 5cm, had no nodal involvement, and had no evidence of metastasis she had stage I disease. This has the best prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of 32-47%. However, even after apparent complete surgical resection, local or distant relapse occurs approximately 40% of the time in children (Teinturier, C et al. 1995). Therefore, she will require life-long follow-up care.
