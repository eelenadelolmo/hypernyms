Texto: 
Pt with limited ROM tender to palpation over proximal right humerus.
Follow up in this case was related to the fracture.  No specific follow up is needed for asymptomatic UBC's.  The main treatment for these cysts include surgery with curettage and packing and recently injection of steroids has been used.
Lytic lesion in the proximal humeral metaphysis.  The lesion is expansile and central with no soft tissue component.  The lesion demonstrates no matrix.  Irregularity to lateral cortex represents a fracture.  A fallen fragment from fracture can be seen within the lesion.
