Vital Signs:  BP 120/77,  HR 92,  T 102.1,  RR 18,  SpO2 98% room air,  Ht 6’3’’,  Wt 347

HEENT:  No notable conjunctival injection, no bleeding or lesions noted in the nostrils.  Mucous membranes were appropriately moist.  No oral lesions.  No sinus tenderness to palpation.  No lymphadenopathy.

CV:  RRR.  No murmurs, rubs, gallops.

Pulm:  Mild crackles noted up to mid-lung fields bilaterally.

Abd:  Non-tender, non-distended, no organomegaly noted.  Large, scaly plaque on the lower abdomen, without bleeding or erythema.

Musc/skel:  Diffuse, scaly plaques along the extensor surfaces of the forearms and lower legs bilaterally.  Full range of motion and strength bilaterally, however experienced moderate pain with movement.

Neuro:  CN II-XII grossly intact.  No apparent deficits.

Hospital Course / Discharge:
14 Days of Moxifloxacin therapy for presumed CAP

Chest Films (A/P & Lateral):  Notable infiltrative process in the left lower lobe, with increased density inferior to the left pulmonary artery.

Chest CT w/o contrast: Prominent left lower lobe infiltrate with notable air bronchograms suggestive of an infectious process.  Diffuse mediastinal lymphadenopathy is also present.

Pulmonary Embolism
CC: Cough x 1 week

HPI:
‘Deep’ cough productive of dark brown sputum
Daily fevers to 102F with chills
Epistaxis x 3-4 weeks
2-3x per week
Each episode lasting about 10 minutes
No attempt at treatment, including OTC meds
No associated shortness of breath, dyspnea or chest pain
Atypical pneumonia in ICL patients has not been well described.  Empiric therapy typically calls for Quinolone antibiotics to address the most common typical and atypical organisms seen in community acquired pneumonias.  As is the case in most C. pneumoniae infections, the bacteria are often difficult to isolate, and treatment regimens are often completed with full resolution of disease without ever having confirmed the causative organism.
