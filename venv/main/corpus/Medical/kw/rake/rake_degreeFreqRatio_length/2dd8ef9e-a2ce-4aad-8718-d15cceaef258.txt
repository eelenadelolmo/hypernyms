Headache. Mildy confused. Non-focal neuro exam.
Supportive.
FLAIR signal hyperintensity is present at the medial aspects of the bilateral frontal lobes, representing parenchymal and probably also subarachnoid hemorrhage. (A couple "unidentified bright objects (UBO's)" are also present.) The areas of bleeding are not apparent on T1 or T2 sequences, and are actually less conspicuous on the CT than on the MR FLAIR sequence.
Acute intracranial hemorrhage, best demonstrated on FLAIR MR imaging.
Acute intracranial bleeding.
62 yo woman fell from her bathroom scale, hit her head, developed headache. Incident occurred a few hours prior to imaging.
