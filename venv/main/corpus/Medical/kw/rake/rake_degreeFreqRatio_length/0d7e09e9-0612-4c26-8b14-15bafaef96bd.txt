Patient's cough is likely due to another etiology not the calcified stylohyoid ligament.  As such, no surgical treatment is recommended for asymptomatic patients with an incidental finding of a calcified stylohyoid ligament.
2.5 mm coronal non-contrast CT images demonstrate incidental finding of calcified left stylohyoid ligament.  A portion of the calcified right stylohyoid ligament is also appreciated (patient is slightly rotated to the right).
Eagle's syndrome
Eagle's syndrome
58 year-old female with chronic cough.  CT scan of the paranasal sinuses performed to rule out sinusitis.
Cough is not a typical component of Eagle's syndrome - in our patient, this is considered an incidental finding.  The vast majority of patient's with a calcified stylohyoid ligament are asymptomatic.
