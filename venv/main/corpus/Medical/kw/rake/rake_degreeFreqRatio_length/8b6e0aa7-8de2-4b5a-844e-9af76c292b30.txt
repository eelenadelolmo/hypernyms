Moderate RLQ abdominal tenderness
General surgery consultants referred patient to pediatrics
Computed Tomography (CT) images demonstrate enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes in the RLQ of the abdomen.  Free fluid is also noted adjacent to the urinary bladder and in the pelvic cul-de-sac.
Mesenteric lymphadenitis
• acute appendicitis
• colitis
• mesenteric lymphadenitis
8 y.o. girl with right lower quadrant pain in the ER.  Her mother reports recurrent upper respiratory infections over the past several months
Meseneteric lymphadenitis is a benign nonspecific process usually involving young adolescents.  The key finding is a self-limited inflammatory process that affects the mesenteric lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen - distal ilium, etc..   The clinical presentation may mimics acute appendicitis; and, a normal appendix must be identified.  There should be an increased number of visible lymph nodes in the RLQ (>5), with some measuring more than 5mm in short axis. 

Treatment: antibiotics are often started empirically which should be comprehensive enough to cover the likely pathogens.  Most frequently caused by viral pathogens, but other infectious agents have been implicated, including Yersinia enterocolitica, Helicobacter jejuni, Campylobacter jejuni, and Salmonella or Shigella species. An association with streptococcal infections of the upper respiratory tract, particularly the pharynx, has been reported. Medical therapy should include third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and doxycycline should be considered in moderately to severely ill patients.
