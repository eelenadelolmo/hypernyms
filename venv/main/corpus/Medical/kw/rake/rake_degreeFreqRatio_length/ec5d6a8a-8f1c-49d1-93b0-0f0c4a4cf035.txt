Comparative studies have shown that MRI is more sensitive and accurate than transvaginal US or hysterosalpingogram for the detection and classification of uterine anomalies.  A septate uterus is distinguished from a bicornuate uterus on transvaginal US and MRI by demonstrating that the fundus is convex, flat, or indented no more than 1cm.  The bicornuate uterus has divergent uterine horns and a fundal cleft greater than 1cm
Bicornuate uterus
Septate uterus vs. bicornuate uterus
21 year old female with a history of infertility.
This is a good example of the limitations of hysterosalpingograms when classifying uterine anomalies.  Because only the inner uterine cavity is visualized, the outer contour of the uterus not seen.  When distinguishing between septate versus bicornuate uterus, the outer uterine contour must be evaluated.  In the cases of new diagnoses, MR or US is the recommended follow up study to attempt to visualize the full uterus to make the diagnosis.  This particular patient had a prior C-section where the surgeon definitively saw the clear separation between the uterine cavities, confirming the diagnosis of bicornuate uterus.
