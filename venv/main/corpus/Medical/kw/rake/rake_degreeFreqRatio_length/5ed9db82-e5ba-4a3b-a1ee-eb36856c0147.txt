Slowly dropping hematocrit.
Catheter directed coil embolization.
Large perinephric hematoma with a focus of active extravasation on post contrast CT angiogram. Conventional angiogram confirms a small cortical bleed which was subsequently coiled.
perinephric hematoma, post-ESWL
None
45 year old male presents 2 days status post lithotrispy with worsening left flank pain.
In this case, one can also appreciate that the posterior contour of the kidney is compressed, consistent with a subcapsular hematoma. Long standing compression in these cases can cause decreased tissue perfusion and subsequent activation of the renin-angiotensin system producing hypertension. This phenomenon is known as Page kidney. It is most commonly seen in trauma but can be associated with neoplasms and renal cystic disease.
