Decreased range of motion of the left knee.
Orthopedic consultation.
MRI of the left knee demonstrates loss of volume of the posterior horn medial meniscus with abnormal increased signal.  There is no double PCL sign.  On axial and coronal T2 fat sat images,a displaced medial meniscus fragment is seen in the notch.  Incidental note is made of a bakers cyst and a chondral defect of the medial femoral condyle.
Left Medial Meniscal Posterior Horn Tear, bucket handle.
Medial meniscus tear/degeneration.
Bucket handle meniscus tear.
52 year old woman with 3 month history of decreased range of motion of the left knee.  The patient is a runner.
Bucket handle tears of the medial meniscus are typically vertical and longitudinal but may be complex as well.  The inner, displaced fragment resembles a handle, the peripheral nondisplaced portion is the bucket and may appear normal, blunted or foreshortened.  Bucket handle tear is most commonly seen in younger, active patients and usually involves the medial meniscus.  Patients may have a history of knee locking or decreased range of motion.  The bucket handle fragment is typically seen as a band of low signal displaced into the notch.  It may be seen as a double PCL sign or only be visible on axial or coronal planes.
