PHYSICAL EXAM:	1. A 5X7mm erythematous,firm, exophytic growth was present on his distal forearm.
2. A firm 1X1.5cm pedunculated flesh-colored mass
was present on the right side of his neck. 
3. Adenoid facies was observed. 
4. A high-arched palate was present. 
5. There was a light flesh-colored to white 2X3mm papule on his left nasal alar fold.
 LABORATORY: None
Patient has been healthy throughout his period of observation. Evaluation by the GI-service has revealed the presence of multiple hamartomatous polyps in his esophagus, stomach, and colon. He is being followed by endocrinology for his thyroid disease and to screen for development of thyroid cancer.

HISTOPATHOLOGY: 1. left forearm - sclerotic fibroma	2. right neck - sclerotic fibroma 3. left nasal ala - fibrous papule
COWDEN'S SYNDROME (1997 Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, Case#21B) Submitted by: LT Charles Miller, MC, USNR
Patient referred to rule out a keratoacanthoma on his left forearm. Lesion had been present 10 years but had recently started enlarging over the last six months. He also requested removal of a "mole" on his right neck. His PMH was significant for Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
