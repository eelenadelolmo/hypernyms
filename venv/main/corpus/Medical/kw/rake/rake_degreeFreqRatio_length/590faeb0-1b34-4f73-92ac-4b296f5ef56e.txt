The pt's pyelonephritis was treated with antibiotics successfully.

However, the incidental finding of the left lobe hepatic mass was ultrasound guided biopsied that was indeterminate for hepatic adenoma, HCC, or FNH the pt was sent to surgery for surgical resection of the mass.  Pt improved s/p surgery and is doing well.
CT findings consistent with acute pyelonephritis involving left kidney.  A large solid heterogeneously enhancing mass 14.1 x 9.9 x 14.6 cm is seen in the left upper quadrant which is associated with the left lobe of the liver displacing the spleen  infra-medially.  Some lower attenuating areas near the center of this lesion may represent necrosis.  No calcification or cystic components.  Prominent vessels are seen at the periphery of the lesion near the left lobe of the liver.  The remainder of the liver demonstrates multiple round hypoattenuating foci of varying sizes, many of which are too small to characterize. 
 
MRI shows multiple lesions in the liver with the largest in the left lobe with similar imaging appearances as in the CT.

Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (FNH)

28 y/o woman with no significant medical hx only taking OCP presented with dysuria, polyuria, & left flank pain.
Hepatocellular adenomas (HA) are usually large, fatty, well circumscribed, nonlobulated, encapsulated tumors.  HA are typically solitary in nature, but ~20% are multiple.  They typically do not have bile ducts or portal vein areas.  They are typically rows of heapatocytes.  HA can develop central necrosis and hemorrhage because the vascular supply is often restricted to the outer surface of the tumor.  Typically in young woman using oral contraceptives pills (OCP) HA is one of the more common hepatic neoplasm as in this patient.  Also, individuals with hemochromatosis , glycogen storage disease, acromegaly, and anabolic steroids users with a hepatic mass are likely to be HA as well.  Some believe that the OCP & anabolic steroids lead to generalized vascular ectasia of the liver leading to the development of HA.  80% of adenomas are solitary and 20% are multiple.

Computed Tomography (CT) in triple phase liver dedicated study demonstrate most HA as a lesion with homogeneous enhancement in the late arterial phase, that will stay isodense to the liver in later phases.  However, these findings in the late arterial phase are not specific to adenomas, since hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hemangiomas, hypervascular metastases, & focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) can show similar enhancement in the arterial phase.  The finding of hemorrhage as an area of high attenuation can be seen in as many as 40% of adenomas.  Fat deposition within adenomas is often difficult to identify on CT and is better visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Due to the risk of intraperitoneal hemorrhage of the HA & the rare occurrence of malignant transformation to HCC, surgical resection has been advocated as the best solution for patients with presumed HA as was done in this case.  Percutaneous fine needle biopsy of a mass suspicious for HA is controversial because of a significant risk hemorrhage & difficult to distinguish from FNH histologically (FNH does not require surgical resection), however, was still performed in this case, but diagnosis could not be made from biopsy.    Also, HA may also decrease in size if not disappear after OCPs have been stopped, in this pt the lesion was felt to be too large to pursue this treatment.
