RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:  An MRI of the pelvis without contrast showed a 2.2 cm partially-imaged pelvic mass, which was associated with the right adnexa.  The mass is hyperlucent, consistent with the abdominal adipose on the scan, possibly showing internal fat. Additionally, multiple uterine fibroids were seen including one large fundal fibroid measuring 4.5 x 5.0 cm. Another left fundal fibroid measures approximately 3.4 x 3.3 cm. Another 3.1 cm mass is seen rising from the right superior uterine fundus that demonstrates increased T2 signal, raising the question of an subserosal fibroid. 

IMPRESSION:
Adnexal mass, possible immature teratoma or dermoid cyst (mature cystic teratoma).  Given the prevalence of uterine fibroids, one cannot exclude the possibility of pedunculated uterine fibroid.  Recommend dedicated pelvic ultrasound and/or MRI of the pelvis with and without gadolinium for further characterization.
Mature cystic teratoma
ovarian neoplasm (benign or malignant), 
tuboovarian abscess, 
endometrioma, 
pedunculated uterine fibroid, 
ectopic pregnancy,
Struma ovarii,
other peritoneal cyst.
HISTORY & PHYSICAL: This is  a 45-year-old white female with a past medical history significant for psoriatic spondyloarthropathy.  Her chief complaint upon presentation was chronic back pain and new onset pelvic pain.  Her review of systems, additional history and physical examination are unknown as this information was not available at the time of this report.
