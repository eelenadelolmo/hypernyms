Primary CNS Lymphoma
A 45 year old man with altered sensorium. 
Ct scan of brain ,plain & contrast study was performed. 
Study revealed multiple ring enhancing lesions with eccentric nodule in bilateral basal ganglia with peri lesional edema.Disc enhancing lesions were also noted in several other areas at gray white matter interface. 
Subsequent investigations revealed the patient to be HIV positive. 
Imaging findings were suggestive of toxoplasmosis. 
subsequently therapy was started.
