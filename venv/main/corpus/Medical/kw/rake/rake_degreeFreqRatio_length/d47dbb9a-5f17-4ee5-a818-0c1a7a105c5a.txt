Texto: 
Well-appearing boy in no acute distress. Patient walked with a slight limp favoring his left foot. No swelling or erythema was present. The patient had normal sensation, range of motion and strength. Patient has tenderness to palpation localized to the medial side of the left mid-foot.
Treatment is symptomatic. Patients are instructed to rest and decrease physical activity. Shoe inserts and walking casts can be used for patients with moderate discomfort.
This disease is self-limiting and resolves spontaneously. Within 2-4 years patients will become asymptomatic and radiographic studies will return to normal.
Oblique and Lateral radiographs demonstrate sclerosis and decreased A-P diameter of the navicular bone.
FSE T2-weighted with fat sat sagittal MR image of the left foot shows high-signal-intensity necrosis and edema in the tarsal navicular bone and low-signal-intensity sclerosis of this bone.

Otherwise healthy 6 year old boy presents to primary care with 2-week history of discomfort in left foot. Mother reports that the boy had been acting normally until two weeks ago when he began to complain of left foot pain. There was no history of trauma, recent or in the past. His mother noted that over the last week the patient has been favoring the left foot and walked with a limp.
