• Paraesophageal: Large, +/- symptoms, warrant surgical treatment

Paraesophageal Type 4 Hiatal Hernia

Pathology: 
• 99% are sliding, 1% paraesophageal
• multifactorial, congenital, acquired
• M>F, increased frequency with increasing age
• Associated abnormalities include reflux, ulcers, diverticulosis, and gallstones
 
• Classification:
1. Sliding, GE junction and cardia intrathoracic
2. Paraesophageal, GE junction in abdomen, fundus intrathoracic
3. Paraesophageal, GE junction and fundus intrathoracic
4. Paraesophageal, Entire stomach and GE junction intrathoracic

•Complications: 
1. gastric volvulus – intrathoracic upside down stomach
2. obstruction, strangulation, perforation or infarction
