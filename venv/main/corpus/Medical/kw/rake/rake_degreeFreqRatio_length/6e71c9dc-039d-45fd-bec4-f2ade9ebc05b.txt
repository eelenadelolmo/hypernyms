Texto: 
Bilateral genu valgum.  
Normal neurovascular exam.  
No palpable deformities.  
Serum calcium normal.
Vitamin D level normal.
Bilateral medial distal femoral physeal stapling to allow lateral growth and decreased medial angulation of the knee joint.  The orthopedic surgeons did not feel that the child had slipped capital femoral epiphyses and did not obtain a frog-leg lateral view, which would have further defined the femoral head placement.
Bilateral femoral physeal widening with dense metaphyseal bands.  Bilateral slipped capital femoral epiphysis noted.  Additionally, the sacroiliac joints appear widened adn there are bilateral coxa vara deformities. 
The constellation of findings suggests a systemic process due to abnormal Vitamin D metabolism.
Vitamin D resistance with radiographic appearance of healing rickets
Radiographically apparent SCFE on AP view
Secondary Hyperparathyroidism, due to renal disease
Primary Hyperparathyroidism
Idiopathic SCFE
Vitamin D deficiency
Calcium deficiency
Phosphorus deficiency

Congenitally low femoral head placement
13 y/o male with non-painful bilateral genu valgum.  Mother with rickets &#8220;as a child&#8221;
