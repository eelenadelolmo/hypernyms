Extreme swelling of neck, LOC, respiratory arrest unstable vitals, intubated by field medic.
This unfortunate soldier was dead within hours; as most injuries of this nature result in.
Extremem soft tissue swelling anterior to entire cervical spine. This is further evident by the ET and NG tube displacement anterior by several centemeters. C1 and C2 are dissociated from each other, completely dislocated.
Atlato-axial dislocation (AOD)
Atlato-axial dislocation (AOD)
Atlato-axial ligamentous injury
While in Operation Provide Comfort (first Iraq conflict in early 90's), this soldier was run over by a jeep, over his head.
Distractive forces to the craniocervical joint by hyperextension-flexion is the probable mechanism of injury in AOD
