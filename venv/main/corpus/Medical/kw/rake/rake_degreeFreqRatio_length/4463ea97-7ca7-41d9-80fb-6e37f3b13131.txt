Nuchal rigidity, but no neurologic deficits.
After demonstration of the subarachnoid hemorrhage and left internal carotid artery aneurysm, the patient underwent emergent surgical clipping.  Three days after surgery she experienced altered mental status, and a repeat angiogram demonstrated vasospasm which was treated with triple H therapy (hypertension, hypervolemia and hemodilution) and remained stable until post operative day eight when she became unresponsive.  A CT scan demonstrated a large area of ischemia involving the majority of the left hemisphere.  Serial clinical exams demonstrated absence of brain stem reflexes and apnea.  Brain death was declared, and after discussion with her family, advanced life support was terminated.
Noncontrast CT scan of the head demonstrates dense subarachnoid collection in the suprasellar and basilar cisterns, as well as along the tentorium.  Note the hydrocephalus demonstrated by the dilatation of the temporal horns and fourth ventricle.
