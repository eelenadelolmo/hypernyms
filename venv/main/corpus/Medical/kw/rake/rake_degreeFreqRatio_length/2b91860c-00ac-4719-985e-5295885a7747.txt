Texto: 
The patient was emergently taken to the OR by the neurosurgery service for a craniotomy, subdural evacuation, and placement of an intracranial drain.  The patient was then cared for in the ICU.  As of two weeks post event, his neurological status had not advanced to the point that he could be discharged from the hospital.
There is a large subdural fluid collection that shows layering, also referred to as the hematocrit effect.  This is secondary to the patient&#39;s anticoagulation regimen and represents the blood settling out into its plasma and cell constituents.  The subdural has and undulating or lobulated appearance which may be secondary to prior, chronic subdural hemorrhages and the development of dural adhesions.
Acute Subdural Hematoma
The main differential considerations in this case are regarding the chronicity of the subdural hemorrhage.
54 y.o. man, 3 days post uncomplicated repair hernia repair. In the morning he is transferred from the ICU to the general medicine and surgery ward.  and a couple hours later, he is found to be somnolent and with a left facial droop.
PMH: The patient has a mechanical cardiac valve and is on an anti-coagulation regimen; and, was being transitioned to his outpatient anti-coagulation regimen.
This case illustrates an acute subdural hematoma associated with anti-coagulation for a mechanical heart valve.
