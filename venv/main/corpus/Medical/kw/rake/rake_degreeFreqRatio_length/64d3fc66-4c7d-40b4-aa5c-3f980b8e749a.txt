Dysmorphic femoral necks and trochanters. There is widening of the physes. Splaying and cupping of the metaphysis. Decreased mineralization of the femoral heads for age. 
There is subperiosteal failure of bone calcification with metaphyseal cupping, fraying, and splaying. Decrease in bone mineralization. 
Hallmarks: metaphyseal irregularity, cupping, physeal widening, demineralization
Nutritional Rickets

Nutritional
Liver disease including Anticonvulsant therapy
Malabsorption: including: Celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Pancreatic insufficiency
Renal tubular insufficiency: including: Vitamin D resistant rickets, Vitamin D dependent (pseudo rickets), Cystine storage disease, Paraneoplastic syndrome, Ifosfamide (not considered based on remainder of pt evaluation: Fanconi syndrome, Lowe)  Chronic renal disease: Renal osteodystrophy

This is an important topic for radiologists to be aware of.  There is a resurgence of literature regarding vitamin d and the current status of levels in all age groups.  Important to note is that mild depression in Vit D does not constitute rickets nor does it result in the findings of child abuse.  For further information regarding this topic and the debate of child abuse and vitamin D the interested can refer to the listed references for this topic.
