Physical: Large, hard, irregular mass in left testicle.

Labs: AFP 3 (normal), BHCG 4 (normal), LDH 352 (elevated)
Left testicle was removed.  Radiation rx pending.  Expect yearly sonography to monitor for developement of tumor in right testicle.
1. Large, lobular intratesticular mass, 2.5 cm x 4.3 cm, heterogeneous, predominately hypoechoic lesion in Left testicle.

2. Bilateral coarse microlithiasis.
Testicular microlithiasis
Seminoma, Classic type
Ddx: mass
1. Seminoma (Classic, Spermatocytic) 
2. Nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (mixed malignant germ cell, embryonal cell carcinoma, yolk sac, teratoma, choriocarcinoma)
3. Stromal tumor (leydig, sertoli, granulosa cell, mixed undifferentiated sex cord)
4. Mixed germ cell-stromal (gonadoblastoma, germ cell-stromal-sex cord)
5. Metastatic (lymphoma, leukemia, myeloma, carcinoma)
6. Other rare tumors and tumorous conditions.

Ddx: testicular calcifications
1. Solitary, postinflammatory granulomatous, vascular.
2. Microlithiasis
3. "Burned-out" germ cell tumor
4. Large cell calcifying sertoli cell tumor
5. Teratoma
6. Mixed germ cell tumor
7. Sarcoid
8. Tuberculosis
9. Chronic infarct

Ddx from Rumack, Diagnostic Ultrasound, 3rd ed.
19yo male with 8 month history of slowly enlarging left testicular mass.
Due to what appeared at presentation to be a rather advanced tumor state, along with bilateral, numerous, large microliths, there was brief discussion as to if both testicles should be removed concurrently due to risk of cancer in the contralateral testicle.

Although, the general impression derived from the literature indicates testicular microlithiasis increases ones chance of having testicular cancer, there is no good data as to the actual risk.  There is also little prospective data on the risk of developing a future cancer.  Given the lack of clear risk, the complications of complete surgical castration, and the very high cure rates for testicular cancers, surgery solely to the affected testicle coupled with follow up was deemed to be sufficient.

In an otherwise healthy patient with microlithiasis, the most common follow up is yearly sonography.  Again, given the uncertain risk, the relatively common incidence of microlithiasis, the high cure rates for testicular tumors, and the possible deleterious psychologic and economic burdens of patients recieving yearly cancer screening sonography, some authors recommend yearly physical examination and routine self examination only.
