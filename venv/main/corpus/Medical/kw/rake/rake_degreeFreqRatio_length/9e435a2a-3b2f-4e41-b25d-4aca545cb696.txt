Axial CT images (non-con, hepatic arterial phase, portal phase, venous phase, and ten minute delayed) demonstrate a single 3 cm mass in the right anterior lobe.  The mass is heterogenously hypo attenuating on the non contrast images.  It demonstrates heterogenous, predominately peripheral enhancement with some inner enhancment on arterial and portal phase images.
