Below 2 standard deviations, height for age.
A patient such as this should be further evaluated with chemical tests to ascertain whether an underlying metabolic disorder exists, assuming patient history is not explanatory (eg. chronic renal disease, etc.). Additional skeletal plain radiographs may also be helpful to verify the abnormality and assess its extent.
Single frontal view of the non-dominant hand is within standards for bone age, but is notable for metaphyseal fraying, especially affecting the distal ulna. Fifth metacarpal is partially obscured but bowed.
Metaphyseal fraying
Rickets (generic term encompassing a variety of underlying disorders)
Developmental variation
6 yom with delayed growth.
