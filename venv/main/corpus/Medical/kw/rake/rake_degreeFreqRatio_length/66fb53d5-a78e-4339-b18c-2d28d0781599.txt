right testicular tenderness, skin edema, low grade fever
Antibiotics
Mild heterogeneity of right testicle with markedly increased color flow in right epididymis and testicle in comparison to left
Epididymo-orchitis
1)  Acute epididymo-orchitis

2)  Diffusely infiltrating tumor:  No focal mass was specifically idendified, the epididymis was hyperemic as well, clinical symptoms were consistent with infection

3)  Reperfusion of a detorsed testicle can show hyperemia
25 y/o male with 1 week of right testicular pain, no trauma
Follow up imaging after treatment is recommended to ensure resolution.  Especially if focal orchitis or atypical presentation, exclusion of neoplastic etiology is needed.
