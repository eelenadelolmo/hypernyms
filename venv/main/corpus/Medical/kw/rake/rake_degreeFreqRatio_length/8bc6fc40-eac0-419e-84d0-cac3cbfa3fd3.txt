Contrast enhanced axial CT images of the neck demonstrate agenesis of the right pinna, external auditory canal and middle ear.  The right inner ear appears intact with slight increased sclerosis about its osseous components.  The right mastoid air cells are essentially absent.

The right zygomatic arch is hypoplastic and the right mandibular ramus and condyle are markedly hypoplastic and malformed.  

The right mandible does not articulate at the TMJ.  The globes appear symmetric bilaterally.
