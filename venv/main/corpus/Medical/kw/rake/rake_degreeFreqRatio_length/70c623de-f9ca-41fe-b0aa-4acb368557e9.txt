Patient underwent left oophorectomy and salpingectomy with right cystectomy.  Right ovary and fallopian tube were not removed secondary to patient desire to remaine furtile.  All appropriate risks and alternatives were discussed with patient.  Patient will be closely followed clinically and the option of removing right ovary and tube will be revisited later.
Pelvic ultrasound demonstrates two large masses of ovarian origin, one in the right adnexa and another centered more midline. Both masses have large cystic components with mural papillary solid components.  Flow is present most of the solid projections.  These findings were reported as highly suspicious for malignancy.
Ovarian tumor of borderline malignancy
24 year old woman with bilateral fullness without pain.  Also, complained of dyspareunia, disruption of menses.
