Bilateral retroareolar nontender masses.
The patient was referred back to the surgeons in the breast care clinic for further management.  Surgical resection is an option however not a requirement for gynecomastia.
Standard two veiw mammograms demonstrate increased tissue density in the retroareolar regions bilaterally.  There is a "flame" shape to the increased tissue density.

Ultrasound demonstrated a focal collection of dilated ducts in the bilateral retroareolar regions.
