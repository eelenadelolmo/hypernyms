Pt initially received physical therapy including electrical stimulation and ultrasound therapy at a 3x/week basis. She also initially received acupuncture and chiropractic treatments also at a 3x/week basis.  This initial care occurred over a 6 week period.  She was dissatisfied and left that facility and began care at the present chiropractic office where the MRI would be ordered.  

Over the course of 5 months patient reports improvement of her symptoms. These include headaches, lower back pain, neck pain, and shoulder pain. Some residual pain of her neck and shoulder still remain, but to a lesser degree when compared to initial presentation.
Pt was also referred to Neurosurgery for consultation. The neurosurgeon felt that the syrinx is asymptomatic and something which can be observed. If follow up MRI shows enlargement, consideration could be given for decompression of the posterior fossa through craniectomy and possible C1 laminectomy.
MRI Cervical Spine with and without contrast
1.	No significant disc herniation.
2.	No significant prevertebral soft tissue swelling
3.	No significant central canal or neural foraminal stenosis at any level
4.	Findings most consistent with a mild Chiari I malformation, cerebellar tonsils low-lying at 6 mm below level of foramen magnum with crowding.
5.	Syringohydromeylia at C6-C7-T1 with no evidence for abnormal enhancement within syrinx to suggest an underlying cervical spinal cord tumor.
Arnold–Chiari malformation I with Syrinx
1.	Arnold Chiari
2.	Vertebral disc herniation
3.	Vertebral fracture
4.	Radiculopathy
5.	Muscle spasm
Five months prior to the MRI evaluation, she was the belted driver of a stopped vehicle, stopped at a red traffic light, when she was hit from behind. The force of the impact caused her vehicle to collide with a stopped vehicle in front of her. Pt’s vehicle was equipped with airbags that did not deploy. According to the pt when vehicle was struck she recalls jerking forward. There was no loss of consciousness and no bleeding. An ambulance arrived and took her to an outside hospital, where she was examined, radiographs were taken, medication was prescribed, and she was released.

Patient reports that following this episode she had pain in the neck, right shoulder, lower back, and also she had a big bruise in the back of the left calf. She reports having headaches on the right side of her head. There is no reported associated nausea, but she does describe associated photophobia and phonophobia. With the onset of headaches she takes Ibuprofen and tries to sleep the headache off. Patient reports no loss of bowel or bladder control.

PMH:
Patient does not report any past medical history

Surgical Hx:
Patient does not report any previous surgeries.

This patient is one of an increasing number of individuals who are being diagnosed with an incidental finding of Arnold Chiari type 1. With an increasing number of people getting imaging done, the incidents of Arnold Chiari I has been on the rise. One study found that within a population of patients who underwent MR imaging at a tertiary care center, 0.77% meet criteria for Chiari Malformation Type I, fourteen percent of which were asymptomatic [14].

With the specific type of presentation for this patient, minor trauma, several questions arise surrounding her diagnosis. Was this malformation present prior to the incident? Was Arnold Chiari malformation precipitated by the accident? Would this type of trauma bring on an earlier presentation of related symptomatology?

The first question of course is almost impossible to answer. A better question would be, how likely it is for a trauma to cause this patient’s Chiari malformation? Freeman et al. reported that patients with a history of motor vehicle crash-associated neck pain, have a substantially higher frequency of cerebellar tonsillar ectopia; 1mm or more than non-traumatic subjects [11]. Freeman et al. and Elsig et al. suggest that a scan performed in an upright scanner may demonstrate increased caudal tonsillar ectopia and that patients post trauma may exhibit instability of the brain that is gravity dependent [10, 11]. Where the brain sits is dependent on the amount of CSF within the dural covering of the spine and brain, which is why post shunting performed to reduce CSF in cases of hydrocephalus can allow the brain to drop in the skull to the point that the cerebellar tonsils herniate through the foramen magnum [7, 9, 11]. Based on this, one can imagine a scenario where trauma can cause a dural leak, lowering pressure and causing the tonsils to herniate. One study showed evidence that dural leaks are associated with whiplash trauma and related symptoms [12]. 

Depending on the populations being studied, 37 to 75% of patients with CMI develop syringomyelia [13, 14]. Several theories have been proposed in the past for the pathogenesis of syringomyelia, many of which assumed a connection between the fourth ventricle and the central canal. A more accepted theory, in which the herniated tonsils act as a piston during systole, was discussed previously in the linked topic [16]. A case study by Takamura et al. describes a young male patient after a motor vehicle trauma acquiring a Chiari Malformation and subsequently a syringomyelia [18]. However, in this reported case the patient also presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage which was attributed as the cause for the acquired Chiari malformation. 

The clinical progression for the patient in this presented case, is still uncertain, particularly since she did not present with any common associated symptoms that one might attribute to Type 1 Chirari malformationsuch as: recurrent suboccipital headache, ocular disturbances, dizziness, disequilibrium, dysphagia, and poor coordination [19]. If she had associated symptoms, then a decompression surgery would be considered for this patient [17]. As discussed previously (in the linked topic), outcomes from surgery depend upon the degree of symptomatology. She also did not have any findings on imaging that would have suggested a possible cause for her Chiari malformation. 
Prognosis for syringomyelia is hard to predict and there have not been many studies in the past evaluating asymptomatic cases. Two long-term observational studies showed that the clinical course of unoperated syringomyelia is slow in the majority of cases and about 50% of patients showed no progression for more than 10 years [2-4]. One study using 103 patients from the Russian Federation, attempted to find a relationship between syrinx dimension and the distribution and severity of clinical symptoms, but were unsuccessful [3]. However, this study did find a correlation between syrinx size and disease progression. A larger Syrinx was related to a relatively rapid progression and shorter duration of disease, while a smaller Syrinx was more likely to present as a slower progression and long duration of disease [3]. This study’s population was all symptomatic and no definitive symptomatic ratio was found. Results were based on a general trend, so it is difficult to make any prediction for our patient. As seen on the images this patient has a Syrinx to cord AP diameter ratio of 0.45. However we cannot interpret this ratio in any significant manner in this patient.   However, the patient does demonstrate motor weakness on her dominant upper extremity without disc herniation.  Since the motor weakness is not limited by pain production it does raise the question regarding the relationship between the syrinx and the motor strength loss.  

The patient presented with symptoms, however considering the progressive recovery and that the symptoms were not strongly associated with the malformation, leads us away from associating these with the Chiari malformation found.  Educating the patient regarding her condition, what symptoms to look out for, and the benefits and risks of surgery should she needed in the future. Periodic neurological assessments would also be a good idea for her in order to catch any associated symptoms early and provide a better prognosis. It has also been shown in several cases that syringomyelia can spontaneously resolve on its own [13]. Therefore, the authors agree with the recommendations given by the Neurosurgeon.
