Increased T2 signal intensity around and within the rectus femoris muscle, most notable at the myotendinous junction.  Increased signal begins at the level of the lesser trochanter and extends distally for 15-20cm.  There is only partial disruption of the myotendinous junction.  No pathology noted in the bone marrow at the lesser tuberosity.
