Specifics unknown in this patient
Increased T2 signal intensity around and within the rectus femoris muscle, most notable at the myotendinous junction.  Increased signal begins at the level of the lesser trochanter and extends distally for 15-20cm.  There is only partial disruption of the myotendinous junction.  No pathology noted in the bone marrow at the lesser tuberosity.
Partial Thickness Tear of the Rectus Femoris Myotendinous Junction
1.	Muscular fiber tear (Rectus Femoris)
