Texto: 
Normal appearing male with distended abdomen.
The patient underwent transurethral resection of the valve on day of life 0 due to inability to pass bladder catheter.  The patient was scheduled to have renal ultrasound and nuclear medicine renal scan to assess kidney function.
A retrograde urethrogram was performed initially, as the catheter could not be passed into the bladder by the nursing staff or radiologists for this examination.  

There is luminal narrowing of the urethra just distal to the verumontanum with dilation of the posterior urethra.

Contrast refluxed into the bladder demonstrates bladder distension, bladder wall trabeculation and diverticula.  High grade vesicoureteral reflux is also noted bilaterally.
Posterior Urethral Valves
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS FOR URETHRAL NARROWING
•Posterior urethral valve
•Urethral stricture

DIFFERENTIAL FOR PRENATAL HYDRONEPHROSIS
•Vesicoureteral reflux
•UPJ obstruction
•UVJ obstruction
•PUV - Males only
•Prune belly (Eagle-Barrett) syndrome - Usually male
Ist day of life baby boy, no urination since birth.  Fetal ultrasound had shown hydronephrosis.
