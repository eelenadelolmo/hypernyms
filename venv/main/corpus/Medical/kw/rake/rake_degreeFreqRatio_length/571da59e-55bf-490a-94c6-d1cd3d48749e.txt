Pain with deep palpation of right hip region.
No lab tests performed.
1. Conservative Watching and Waiting.
2. Orthopedic Treatment Options:
Internal fixation with intramedullary nails 
provides stabilization of extensively affected bones 
prevents further fractures and major deformities 
curettage, and bone grafting.
3. Medical Management: 
Intravenous infusions with the bisphosphonate compound: i.e. Alendronate, Pamidronate.
These drugs alter bone resorption and may help the pain of fibrous dysplasia  and also may strengthen the bone.
