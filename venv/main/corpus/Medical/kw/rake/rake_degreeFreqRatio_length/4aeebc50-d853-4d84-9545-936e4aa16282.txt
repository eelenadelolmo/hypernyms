VITALS
- BP 110/70, HR 80, Resp 12, Temp 97.6
PHYSICAL EXAM
- Alert, Awake and Oriented
- CN I-XII intact
- 3/5 upper and lower extremity on both flexion and extention on left. normal right.
- nl sensation to hot,cold,light touch and pin prick in all extremities.
LABS
- normal Electrolytes, Hgb/Hct, and WBCs.
This patient was treate with unfractionated heparin and fully recovered.
MRI/MRV of the brain demonstrates a filling defect in a large cortical draining vein, likely the vein of Trolard, on the right corresponding to territorial high signal abnormalities on FLAIR and diffusion weighted images and low signal abnormalities on ADC images.
Thrombosis of the right superior anastomotic vein (vein of Trolard)
None.
31 year old G1 P2002 at 7 days post partum after spontaneous vaginal delivery complicated by late pre-eclampsia presents with new onset left sided weakness and headache.
This patient initially had a completely negative non contrast CT of the head.  Had the workup stoped here, a diagnosis would never have been made.  This case illustrates the advantate MRI/MRV of the brain has over conventional CT in the workup of neurologic abnormalities in a patient with a high risk for a cerebral venous thrombotic event.
