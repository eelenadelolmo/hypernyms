Treatment with surgical decompression is usually performed on patients with greater than 5mm midline shift or maximal thickness greater than 1cm.  Surgical treatment is also performed for comatose patients with hematomas less than 1cm or less than 5mm midline shift if the GCS decreases by 2 points, the pupils are fixed and dilated or intracranial pressure is greater than 20mm Hg.  Treatment is with craniotomy and evacuation of hematoma.

Meagher RJ.  Subdural Hematoma. eMedicine Nov 2006.
Non-contrast enhanced CT of the brain shows a large right sided extra-axial fluid collection.  The fluid is high density with dependent areas of increased density.  There is significant mass effect with right to left midline shift.
Subdural hematoma
Acute subdural hematoma
Chronic subdural hematoma
85 year old male presents to the emergency department with altered mental status after a fall.
The patient underwent emergent craniotomy and evacuation of hematoma.
