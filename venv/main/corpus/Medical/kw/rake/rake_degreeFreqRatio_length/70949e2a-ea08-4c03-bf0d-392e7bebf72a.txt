This 74 year old woman has a prior history of rheumatic heart disease, hypothyroidism, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and GERD. She complained of having angina over the past couple of months and described the sensation as a pressure over her chest. She had an echocardiogram performed but it was inconclusive. No valvular abnormality was noted at that time.  She was advised to get CT imaging to identify any possible causes for her angina.
Blood pool inversion technique of imaging was developed by Dan Entrikin of Wake Forest University.
