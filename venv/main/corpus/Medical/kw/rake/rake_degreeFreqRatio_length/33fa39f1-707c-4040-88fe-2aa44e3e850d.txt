Goal of treatment is to induce and maintain remission.  In the process, amelioration of symptoms and improvement in the patient's quality of life are essential.  Aminosalicylates, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, immune modulators (methotrexate, cyclosporine) and biologic response modifiers are potential treatments.  Surgery is often required with 3/4th patients having had surgery by 20 years post diagnosis.  Since recurrence is common, surgery attempts to preserve intestinal length.
