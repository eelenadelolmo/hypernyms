Texto: 
Well elderly male with palpable gastric mass. 
CBC, chemistry, and coagulation panels all within normal limits. Heliobacter pylori positive.
Heliobacter pylori eradication, chemotherapy
â€¢A long segment of the gastric wall lesser curvature is asymmetrically thickened to 23mm. The fat plane between the liver and the stomach appears to be preserved.  
â€¢Additional findings not shown in selected image: A 9 mm lymph node is present between the stomach and the liver. An 11mm pancreatic node is seen.  
â€¢ The liver, spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. A 3.2 cm simple cyst is seen in the superior pole of the right kidney. The left kidney is unremarkable.
Gastric MALT Lymphoma, poorly differentiated
â€¢ Adenocarcinoma
â€¢ Gastric lymphoma
â€¢ Metastatic disease
â€¢ Gastritis
75 y/o man with a history of chronic active gastritis and refractory gastric ulcer.  A 6 cm by 6 cm gastric mass found on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).
Gastric MALT lymphoma is associated with H Pylori infection. While eradication of H Pylori is often (60-75%) sufficient to effect remission, higher grade lesions, as evidenced by the lesion's histopathology require additional chemotherapy. This patient achieved full remission.
