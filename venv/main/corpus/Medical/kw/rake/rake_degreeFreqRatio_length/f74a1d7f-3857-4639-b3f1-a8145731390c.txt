Breast Hamartoma (Fibroadenolipoma)
Breast hamartoma
43 year old who presents for annual screening mammogram.
Hamartomas are included in the differential for multiple breast masses.  The capsule may not always be as well defined or as visible as in this case however look for variations in fat density.  The fat density within the harmartoma will be less dense the normal, surrounding fibroglandular tissue.
