CALCIUM PYROPHOSPHATE DIHYDRATE (CPPD) CRYSTAL DEPOSITION DISEASE
Calcium pyrophosphat deposition disease
Wilsons disease
Hemochromatosis
71 year old female who presents to the internal medicine clinic for bilateral knee pain.
This case is a classic presentation of chondrocalcinosis. It demonstrates an osteoarthritic finding in an atypical location, the patellofemoral joint.  Osteoarthrtis most commonly affects the medial aspect of the knee.  In this patient, the medial and lateral knee compartments are relatively preserved.  CPPD also affects the lateral knee compartment of the knee typically before the medaial compartment.
