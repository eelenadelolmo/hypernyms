S/P ERCP CYTOPATHOLOGY:
1) PANCREATIC DUCT BRUSHING - ADENOCARCINOMA.
2) COMMON BILE DUCT BRUSHING - ATYPICAL CELLS NOS.
SURGERY IS ONLY OPTION WITH CYTOPATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS OF PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA. UNLIKELY SURGICAL CANDIDATE GIVEN SIGNS OF UNRESECTABLE DISEASE WITH EVIDENCE OF REGIONAL NODAL SPREAD. PALLIATIVE STENTING OF OBSTRUCTED COMMON BILE DUCT HAS BEEN APPROPRIATELY INSTITUTED.
ERCP: 
1) DOUBLE DUCT SIGN - CBD AND PANCREATIC DUCTAL OBSTRUCTION WITH CONSEQUENT PROXIMAL DUCTAL DILITATION.
CT, CONTRAST-ENHANCED:
1) PANCREATIC DUCTAL DILITATION WITH HYPODENSE REGION WITHIN PANCREATIC HEAD WHICH MAY REPRESENT VOLUME AVERAGING AND/OR SITE PANCREATIC DUCTAL CANCER.
2) 1.2 CM PERIPANCREATIC NODE.
3) COMMON BILE DUCT S/P STENT PLACEMENT.
MRCP:
1) CONSISTENT WITH ERCP FINDINGS AS ABOVE.
PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA
1) OTHER EXOCRINE TUMORS OF PANCREATIC HEAD: CYSTIC NEOPLASM (MICRO-, MACROCYSTIC ADENOMA), INTRADUCTAL PAPILLARY MUCINOUS TUMOR.
2) ENDOCRINE TUMORS OF PANCREAS: INSULINOMA, GASTRINOMA, NONFUNCTIONING ISLET CELL TUMOR
3) LYMPHOMA
4) METASTATIC DISEASE
5) PANCREATITIS
47 YEAR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH PAINLESS OBSTRUCTIVE JAUNDICE.
