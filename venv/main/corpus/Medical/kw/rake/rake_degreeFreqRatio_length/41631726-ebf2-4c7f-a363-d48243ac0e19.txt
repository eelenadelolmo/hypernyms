The first series of images were obtained after pre-medication with captopril, and demonstrate the following:
1) Normal flow to the kidneys.
2) Normal cortical excretion and clearance of the right kidney.
3) Retention of the radiopharmaceutical within the upper pole of the left kidney, predominantly within the cortex, which does not clear significantly over time.
4) Clearance of radiopharmaceutical that does reach the left renal collecting system.
5) Normal split renal function; (the area of concern is too small to quantitate accurately).

The second series of images were obtained without pre-medication with captopril, and demonstrate the following:
1) Normalization of the cortical retention problem noted on the first series of images (described above).
2) Normal split renal function.
