Physical exam: Hard right testicle enlarged to 7 centimeters.

Labs:
Alpha fetoprotein: 1653 ng/mL (0-8.50, normal)

Beta HCG: <2.0 mIU/L (0-5.0, normal)

Pathology:  
Mixed Germ Cell Tumor, 55% Yolk Sac Tumor and 45% Teratoma
Patient had a radical orchiectomy and had a negative staging CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis which were negative for metastatic disease.
Superior pole of the right testicle demonstrates microcalcifications.  Complex heterogeneous solid mass with cysts and calcifications in the right testicle.
Mixed Germ Cell Tumors of the Testicle
Teratoma
Germ Cell Tumor
28 year old with a 2 week history of right testicular swelling and pain.  Patient was treated for epididymitis prior to evaluation by urology after refractory pain and swelling.
Diffuse microcalcifications are associated with &#8220;germ cell malignancies, infertility, Klinefelter&#8217;syndrome, and cryptochordism&#8221; (Brant). Forty percent of males with testicular microlithiasis have associated germ cell neoplasm. These findings are typically bilateral. Sonographic images show diffuse but irregular punctate echodensities without shadowing (Brant).
