Texto: 
Palpable mass in the 12:00 position of the left breast.
Scars from previous cosmetic breast surgery.
No further treatment.
Routine annual screening mammograms.
Mammography - Dense irregularly shaped and ill-defined density seen only on the MLO view at the 12:00 position of the left breast.  Striated shape of density suggests location within chest wall musculature

Ultrasound - Hypoechoic mass with distal acoustic shadowing in the chest wall musculature.
Silicone Granulomas of the Breast (confirmed by ultrasound guided biopsy)
Differential Diagnosis for ill-defined irregularly-shaped breast mass:
1.	Carcinoma
2.	Silicone Granuloma
3.	Scar (post-surgical or radial)
4.	Fat Necrosis
5.	Extra-Abdominal Desmoid
48 y.o. female s/p bilateral breast implant removal due to complication with the left breast implant (rupture).
