1.  Bard retrievable filter is seen just right of the lumbar spine.  Right internal jugular vein access was achieved with ultrasound guidance, and a long superstiff wire was placed through the IVC and into the left common iliac vein (note also the presence of an enteric sump tube to the left of the IVC filter and the wire).

2.  Pre-retrieval IVC-gram demonstrates no evidence of thrombus, especially at the level of the filter.

3.  A large sheath is placed over the wire, and the filter is engaged.

4.  And this is confirmed with oblique views.

5.  The filter is drawn into the sheath and is removed.

6.  Post-retrieval IVC-gram shows no extravasation of contrast material.  Sucessful retrieval of an inferior vena cava filter.
