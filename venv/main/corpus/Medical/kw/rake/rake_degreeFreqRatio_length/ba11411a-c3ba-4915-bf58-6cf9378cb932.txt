General:  Weight 3454 gm, Intubated and mechanically ventilated. 
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs/rubs/gallops.  Heart sounds are present in the right side of the chest.
Lungs:  Mild intercostal retractions lower 1/3 of rib cage, breath sounds slightly decreased in left lower lobe, coarse prior to suction, cleared after suction. Intubated on conventional ventilator; vent settings of RR 25, pressures 22/5, pressure support 8, FiO2 21%.
Abdomen:  Patient with an umbilical artery catheter in place.
Skin: Pink, no cyanosis, good skin turgor

The child was scheduled for resection of left lower lobe secondary to his pulmonary insufficiency caused by the mass effect of the lesion, left upper lobe was felt to be unaffected and would not be resected.  Surgery was successful and at his first follow-up appointment at POD # 26 the patient was seen in clinic and was doing well.  Patient to follow up for final check in 6 months.
Chest CT with contrast:  The lungs are hyperinflated with flat diaphragms. A large mass is present in the left thorax along its lateral aspect. It extends from above the level of the aortic arch to the level of the diaphragm. It measures approximately 6 cm AP x 8 cm vertically x 5 cm transverse. It consists of multiple air-filled cysts, ranging up to 3 cm in diameter, as well as low attenuation areas that likely represent cysts which are not yet aerated. Some enhancing tissue around its border likely represents lung which is not yet well aerated. The cardiomediastinum is shifted toward the right with the left lung herniating across the midline anteriorly. No abnormal systemic blood supply is seen.  Endotracheal tube is identified as well as catheter in the descending aorta. Central pulmonary arteries have a normal branching pattern. Superior vena cava is right-sided.

Infant born at 37 weeks gestation to a 19 year old G2P1 mother with A+ blood type, rubella immune, HbsAg negative, RPR non-reactive, and GBS positive (treated with ampicillin during labor).  Pregnancy was complicated by hypertension and polyhydramnios.  Child was delivered by Cesarean section due to maternal hypertension.  Apgar scores after delivery were 5,9,9 at minutes 1,5,10 respectively.  Shortly thereafter the child developed respiratory distress was placed on CPAP, given one dose of surfactant, and ultimately required intubation.
