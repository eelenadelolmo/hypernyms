Currently asymptomatic with sterile urine.
Currently none.  Surgery is an option.
CYSTOURETHROGRAM: A filling defect is noted on the right during early bladder filling with contrast that is not seen when the bladder is distended with contrast.

US, RETROPERITONEAL: There is a thin walled cystic structure along the posterior right bladder wall, which measures approximately 8 mm in diameter.  During dynamic scanning this cyst is seen to distend, and then a ureteral jet is visualized arising from it with the cyst partially decompressing. There are no stones or debris within the bladder.
Simple ureterocele
-Simple Ureterocele or in combination with duplication
-Wall trabeculation
-Bladder diverticulum
-Urachal cyst
-Cystitis cystica
-Fistula
8 month old female with first urinary tract infection.
The kidneys were normal in size and echogenicity without duplication. The corticomedullary differentiation was normal and there was no cortical thinning.  There was no dilatation or duplication of renal pelvi, calyces, or ureters bilaterally.
