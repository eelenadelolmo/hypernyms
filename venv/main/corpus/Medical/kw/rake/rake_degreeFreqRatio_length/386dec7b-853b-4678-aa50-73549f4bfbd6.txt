General:  Well-nourished, well-appearing, no acute distress. 

Musculoskeletal:  Point tenderness over lateral aspect of knee, slightly below the joint line.  Approximately a 2 cm hard nodule felt on palpation.  Nodule is non-mobile.  No erythema, swelling, tenderness.

Laboratory:  Unremarkable
Patient was referred to outpatient management for further workup of the lytic lesion and excisional removal with wide margins.
Anteroposterior, lateral and tunnel radiographs of the right knee show an expansile lytic lesion of the proximal fibula with fairly narrow zone of transition.  Lesion measures approximately 4.0 x 3.9 cm AP x LR and extends approximately 7.0 cm SI.  
On bone scans, mass demonstrates  that increased radiotracer accumulation, with suggestion of a mild photopenic area centrally.  Tibia and femur are otherwise normal in appearance. No additional abnormal radiotracer uptake throughout the remainder of the regions of the left and right knees. No associated periosteal reaction or soft tissue mass.   Normal soft tissue radiolabel uptake.

21 year old woman, complaining about pain in her right knee for the past 4 months.  Pain has gradually increased in intensity, interfering with her fitness routine.   Pain is not worse during the mornings or at night.  No fevers, chills nor night sweats.
Giant Cell Bone Tumors are destructive lesions of bone that may be well-defined althoughs sometimes aggressive.   Giant cells are large cells which consist of fused stromal cells.  These tumors are very rare, affecting approximately one a million, usually between the ages of 25 and 40, with most tumors occurring in the 30’s.  Women are affected slightly more than men (50-57%).   This syndrome does not have a genetic link, nor a known cause.

Giant Cell Tumors are seen on radiographs as expansive osteolytic lesions surrounded by a thin rim of white bone.  They are usually near a joint, with 60% occurring at the epimetaphyseal region of long bones.  Fifty percent occur around the knee joint.  They are almost exclusively seen when the epiphysis of the bone is closed.  In 5-10%, these tumors may metastasize to the lungs.

Giant Cell Tumors present with progressive pain as the bone tumor irritates the periosteum and sometimes leads to a pathologic fracture. 

Treatment is surgical – intralesional excision with extensive curettage or may be resection depending upon the extension outside the bone and into the joint.  Various methods are available to ensure tumor cell destruction.  The lytic lesion is stabilized with cement or bone graft.  Non-weight bearing bones may be simply removed with wide excision.  Patients with lung metastases should be further evaluated for resection of metastases(which, surprisingly, may not be necessary).

Prognosis is good, even with metastatic disease.  Local recurrence rates are high, with a 10% to 50% recurrence rate.  Patients should be periodically followed for 2 years after excision.
