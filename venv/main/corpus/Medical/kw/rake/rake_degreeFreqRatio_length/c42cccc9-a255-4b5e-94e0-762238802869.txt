This disease is named after Louis L?opold Ollier a French surgeon famous for his work in orthopedic and reconstructive surgery in late 1800's. 

Enchondromatosis most frequently involves the short tubular bones of hands and feet as well as long bones of upper and lower extremities.  This is a nonhereditary abnormality with one side affected more severely. Lesion growth stabilizes at puberty. Most lesions are metaphyseal or diaphyseal however there can be growth disturbance if the lesion involves the growth plate.

Debated amount of increased risk for chondrosarcoma; however, in an adult long bone with pain and no evidence of fracture malignancy should be considered until proven otherwise.

Enchondromatosis with multiple soft tissue hemangiomas is termed Maffucci’s syndrome. This is unilateral and involves the hands and feet, and carries an increased risk of malignant transformation compared to Ollier’s disease.
