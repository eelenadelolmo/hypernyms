Follow-up US demonstrated no fetal cardiac activity; D&C was performed.
1. Well-circumscribed 1.0x0.6x1.3 cm anechoic oval focus within the endometrial cavity containing a 3.0 m tissue density and no detectable fetal heart tones.

2. Heterogeneously hyperechoic tissue within the endometrial cavity with enumerable cystic foci and scattered flow by color ultrasound.
Partial Hydatidiform Mole
1. Partial hydatidiform mole
2. Early IUP
3. Intrauterine hemorrhage
G6P5005 at approximately 5 weeks gestation by LMP presents for follow-up pelvic ultrasound.  Initial study was performed 6 days prior for right lower quadrant pain and showed a 5.4x6.0x5.8 mm cystic structure within the uterine cavity that may represent early IUP, abnormal IUP or pseudogestational sac of ectopic pregnancy.
