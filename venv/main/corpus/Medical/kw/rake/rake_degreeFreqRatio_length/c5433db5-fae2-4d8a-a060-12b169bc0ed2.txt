2. AT THE C2-C3 LEVEL, THERE IS MILD SMALL CENTRAL SUBLIGAMENTOUS DISC PROTRUSION WITH MINIMAL EFFACEMENT OF ANTERIOR SUBARACHNOID SPACE 
3.	IF FURTHER EVALUATION OF RADICULAR SYMPTOMS OR FORAMINAL PATHOLOGY IS REQUIRED CORRELATION WITH EMG AND/OR NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES WOULD BE HELPFUL.

CC: S/P MVA on 6/11/ this year, here for follow-up
HPI: Eight years ago, patient noticed that she was having right arm pain which interfered with her work. This was followed by bilateral knee pain and subsequently left arm pain; these pains “never went away.” Her primary physician diagnosed her with MS. Soon after, she had a “full attack” where she experienced aphasia and lower limb paralysis. She remained an inpatient for two weeks. This stay was followed by steroids and a trial of Tysabri. She had to discontinue Tysabri with pregnancy four years ago. This caused her to experience another exacerbation, namely diffuse shaking tremors . Until four years ago, patient had also experienced episodes of sciatic nerve paresthesias, ocular blindness, seizures, and daily bowel incontinence. From four year ago until the present, patient had clinical depression but no other MS symptoms.
In June of this year, the patient was in a motor vehicle accident. Immediately following the accident, she reports loss of sensation in her lower extremities bilaterally, shortness of breath, bilateral loss of vision, and  back pain. She was not however admitted to the hospital.  Since the accident she experiences daily frontal headaches which are throbbing, associated with photophobia and occasional syncope, and relieved by ibuprofen. She has also had daily arm and leg tremors, intermittent memory difficulties and decreased energy.
Past Medical History: Asthma, HTN; G6P4024
Past Surgical History: Cholecystectomy, tubal ligation, D and C x2.
Current medications include Soma, Lortab, Ambien, and Ibuprofen (approximately 800 mg every 6 hours).
Allergies: Environmental (summer season).
Social History: Denies alcohol, tobacco, or other drug use, 4-5 cups of coffee/day. 
Family Hx: Mother: living, diabetes mellitus; Father: deceased: CVA in his late forties.
CASE CONTRIBUTORS:Angella Sandell MS 1V, Joanna Garvey, DC; Geoffrey Gerow, DC; Randall Loftus, MD; Krishnan Kartha, MD; Joseph Serghany, MD; Charles Tirone MD.  

The question we are exploring in this case is whether physical trauma can be a cause of exacerbation of multiple sclerosis symptoms. Literature explores  this association in the form of animal models, which show that with physical trauma, integrity of blood-brain-barrier is compromised. This compromise of the BBB underlies an MS type progression theory.  The theory is based on  the concept that a breakdown of the BBB  is necessary for immune cells to cross and subsequently attack native myelin of oligodendrocytes. However , most peer-reviewed prospective and retrospective studies do not suggest a clinical correlation, as outlined in the topic discussion attached to this case. The relationship of physical trauma and MS symptom exacerbation is curious, though, regardless of what one prospective study and other equivoval published literature found; many case reports, patient online forums, and litigation exist in support of an association. Our patient, with pre-existing MS since 2004 (for which there is 2010 MRI imaging available associated with this case report), exemplifies a possible manifestation of the relationship we are exploring. 

The patient stated that immediately following the motor vehicle accident, she experienced ophthalmologic blindness, bilaterally, along with bilateral loss of function and sensation of her lower extremities, which lasted for one week.  In this case it would be prudent to acquire ER records to further understand these described complaints.  She reported not being admitted to the local hospital. 
Vision was tested during a follow-up meeting with the patient, five months after the accident. She demonstrated 20/30 vision in both eyes without glasses. This does not rule out that patient-reported loss of vision at the time of her accident was related to MS because MS symptoms classically wax and wane.

During our meeting in November, she also reported bilateral arm pain and leg pain, which she said she had experienced since the accident. She did also give a history of arm and leg pain since 2004. MRI from 12/2012 demonstrates that she has findings on MRI evaluation that is consistent with degenerative disc disease that likely could be of long standing nature.  However, she also demonstrates findings on MRI that are suggestive of recent worsening that is consistent with post MVA findings.    Exacerbation of disc disease following a high impact motor vehicle accident is a plausible cause of herniation of vertebral discs. Regarding her reported arm and leg tremors, it was not demonstrated on evaluation—neither intention nor resting tremor was observed.  Tremors could be due to a number of pathologies and further evaluation by a neurologist is warranted.

She has experienced daily headaches since the accident. Headaches, along with almost any neurologic complaint, can be due to multiple sclerosis. Headaches, though, could also be related to her accident. This is known as a “post-traumatic headache.” In its chronic form, post-traumatic headaches may not remit.  Migraine headache and multiple sclerosis are known to coexist.   

It should be noted that the patient has had extensive multiple sclerosis disease since at least 2010 (see imaging). It would be difficult to quantify disease progression since that point, as diffuse plaques were present in the past. Images (MRI, brain) were obtained in 12/2012 as follow-up. Though the images continue to demonstrate extensive disease, it is unclear whether it has progressed since 2010 due to the 2012 MRI only having axial scans and where the coronal and sagittal images were not performed.  

Finally, the patient has admitted history of depression. Headaches, fatigue, and memory difficulties can all be related to depression. Patient follow-up with an outpatient psychiatrist to manage these symptoms (once other serious causes are ruled out) would be prudent. Constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and memory difficulties could be due to systemic medical disease other than multiple sclerosis, such as hypothyroidism, iron or other nutrient and mineral deficiencies, or impaired sleep due to obstructive sleep apnea.
