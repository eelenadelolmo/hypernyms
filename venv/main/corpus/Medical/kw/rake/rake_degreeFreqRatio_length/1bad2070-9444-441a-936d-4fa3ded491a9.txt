Heterogeneous irregular ring-enhancing mass right temporal lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema. Small, thin and irregular linear areas of T-1 shortening (bright) may represent hemorrhage, melanin, or even micro-calcifications.  The lesions shows some peripheral rim T2-shortening (dark) which is also consistent with older hemorrhage (ferritin or hemosiderin).
