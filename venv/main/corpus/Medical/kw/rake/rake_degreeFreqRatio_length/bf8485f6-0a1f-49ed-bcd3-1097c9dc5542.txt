N/A
She was diagnosed with acute appendicitis on CT, however there was also an incidental finding in the left lower quadrant.  

Patient is in stable condition with a favorable prognosis.
Contrast enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate a mass arising from the left ovary (notice the “claw sign”) with fat, soft tissue, and calcified components.  The mass measures approximately 5.5 cm in largest dimension.
Mature benign cystic teratoma
On the Left:
• Mature cystic teratoma
• Ovarian neoplasm (epithelial carcinoma)
• Endometrioma

On the right:
• Appendicitis
24 y.o. woman presented to the ER with right lower quadrant pain.

A mature cystic teratoma (a.k.a. "dermoid cyst") is a benign neoplasm made up of a variety of parenchymal cell types.  Mature cystic teratomas may contain hair, teeth, fat, skin, and muscle.  They are the most common ovarian germ cell tumor, and usually present by age 30.  The most common location is sacrococcygeal (57%), although they are commonly seen in the ovaries, or less frequently the testes.  They are usually asymptomatic and diagnosed as an incidental finding on CT or ultrasound. Complications include torsion, rupture, or malignant degeneration.   Malignant degeneration is rare and only occurs 1-2% of the time. 

Diagnosis is easily made by ultrasound, CT, or MRI.  Mature cystic teratomas appear as heterogenous hyperechoic masses on ultrasound, with cystic and solid components.  Calcification may show posterior shadowing on ultrasound.  The “tip of the iceberg” sign refers to a strong echogenic interface at the leading edge of the mass, blocking deeper components from view.  On CT, they are described as a well-defined heterogenous mass with fat, soft tissue, and calcified components.  As in this case, a “claw sign” or rim of ovarian tissue may be noted surrounding the mass.  MRI demonstrates a mass with mixed T1 and T2 signal intensity.  A fluid/fat debris level may be present, with chemical shift artifact from fat.  If the teratoma is less than 6cm, some propose conservative management.  If larger, surgical resection is recommended.
