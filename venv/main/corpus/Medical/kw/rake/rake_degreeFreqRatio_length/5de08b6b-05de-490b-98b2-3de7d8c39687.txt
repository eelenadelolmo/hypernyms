Rotator cuff biceps tendinitis.
Incidental note of mid proximal humerus endosteal scalloping on plain film evaluation - Now, referred for evaluation of the right shoulder with MRI.
No treatment is required if bone lesions are stable and do not incur pathological fracture. If so stabilization surgery is required.
Bone scan for evaluation of other bone involvement.
Follow-up imaging is recommended to document stabilty and monitor for malignant degeneration.
• Plain film RUE - Endjavascript:void(null);osteal scalloping and lucency within the mid to proximal shaft of the right humerus.

• Plain MR of the right shoulder - Multiloculated cystic lesion of proximal humerous with some solid component and associated endosteal remodeling without evidence of cortical breakthru. 

• MRI of the right humerus w/ contrast - 
Multifocal, predominantly cystic multiloculated circumscribed bony lesions spare the humeral epiphyses, the largest proximal metaphyseal lesion measuring approximately 5.2 cm in its maximum diameter.  The lesions exhibit predominantly peripheral enhancement and a mild increase in central T1 intensity suggesting a proteinaceous/fibrous matrix.  No overlying cortical disruption is seen in the setting of grossly stable associated endosteal scalloping.  No circumferential soft tissue abnormality is identified.
Monostotic Fibrous Dysplasia
• polyostotic fibrous dysplasia
• enchondroma
• Other differential diagnoses include:
Eosinophilic Granuloma, Fibrous Cortical Defect, Nonossifying Fibroma, Giant Cell Tumor, Neurofibromatosis Type 1, Paget Disease, Hemangioma, Hyperparathyroidism, Metastasis
A 29-year-old man with injury to right shoulder while lifting weights. Clinically diagnosed with rotator cuff biceps tendinitis.
Plain radiographs are highly specific when characteristic features are present in a lesion. MRI findings complement plain radiographs. On T1-weighted MRIs,  fibrous dysplasia has a low-to-intermediate signal intensity rougly equal to that of muscle.
