Consistent with rotator cuff or labral tear.
Contrast is seen between the superior labrum and the glenoid, indicating a separation of the glenoid labrum from the osseous glenoid.
SLAP Lesion of the Glenoid Labrum
SLAP tear (Superior Labrum Anterior Posterior)
Normal variant
Athlete with a painful shoulder.
The images are from an MR arthrogram, where a combination of iodinated and gadolinium based contrast material is injected into the joint prior to MR imaging.  The iodinated contrast is so the correct location is confirmed on fluoroscopy prior to sending the patient to the MRI Suite.
