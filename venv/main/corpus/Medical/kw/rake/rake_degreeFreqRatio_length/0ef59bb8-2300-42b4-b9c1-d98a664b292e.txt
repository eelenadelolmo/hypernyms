This patient was treated with both radiation and concomitant chemotherapy.
T2 sequence reveals a nasopharyngeal mass on the right measuring approximately 2 cm. It invades the fossa of Rosenmueller and there is extension of this mass into the skull base. It is heterogeneous in appearance but mildly hyperintense to surrounding muscles. Note is made of inflammatory debris within the right mastoid air cells.
On pre contrast T1 images, the mass is again visualized. It is isointense to the surrounding muscles. After administration of Gd-DPTA, there is  homogeneous enhancement of the mass.
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, undifferentiated type.
