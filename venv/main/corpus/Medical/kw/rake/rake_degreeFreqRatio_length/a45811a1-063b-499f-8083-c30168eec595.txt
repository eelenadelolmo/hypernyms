Non-contrast CT images of the head with "stroke window" settings demonstrate a wedge-shaped focal area of decreased density and loss of gray-white matter differentiation at the leve of the right frontal lobe, just anterior to the central sulcus.

Diffusion weighted and associated ADC map axial MR images show a corresponding focus of restricted diffusion, consistent with an acute infarct.
