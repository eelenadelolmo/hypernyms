Texto: 
Arterial or venous thrombolysis, thrombectomy, or surgical decompression and shunt placement.
Near occlusive thrombosis is seen in the main portal vein with complete occlusion of the right portal vein, but trace contrast to the left portal vein.  There is no evidence of enhancement within the thrombus.  These findings suggest a bland thrombus.
Portal Vein Thrombosis
Idiopathic, portal vein invasion or compression by tumor, post operative (splenectomy, transplant), blood dyscrasias, coagulopathies, sepsis, pylephlebitis, pancreatitis, cholangitis, suppurative lymphadenitis, cirrhosis, and portal hypertention.
71 year-old male three months post radio frequency ablation of liver malignancy.
