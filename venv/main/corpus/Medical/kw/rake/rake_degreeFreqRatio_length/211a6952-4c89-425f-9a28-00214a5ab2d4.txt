Texto: 
There is a mass in the frontal horn of the right lateral ventricle.  The lesion appears attached to medial, rather than the lateral wall.

This lesion does not enhance after Gadolinium injection.

Subpendymomas are uncommon low-grade tumors, thought (perhaps) to arise from subependymal cells called "tanycytes".  These lesions occur most often either as asymptomatic masses in the 4th ventricle - or as symptomatic masses in the lateral ventricles.

Most 4th ventricular ependymomas show some contrast enhancement; whereas most in the lateral ventricle do not enhance.
