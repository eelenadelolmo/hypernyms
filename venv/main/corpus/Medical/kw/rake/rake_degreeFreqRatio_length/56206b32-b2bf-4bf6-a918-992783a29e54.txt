Symmetrical areas of T2 hyperintensity are noted in the deep cerebral white matter. In addition, there is a prominence of the sulci and ventricels, which is greater than would be expected for age, consistent with diffuse cerebral atrophy.
Metachromatic Leukodystrophy
The imaging findings for metachromatic leukodystrophy are non-specific, and can be seen in many of the dysyelinating disorders.  These disorders typically spare the subcortical U fibers until late in the disease.

In addition, some demylenating processes, such as toxins/radiation may result in a diffuse white matter pattern.
Change in gait and mental status. Follow up of known neurological disorder
