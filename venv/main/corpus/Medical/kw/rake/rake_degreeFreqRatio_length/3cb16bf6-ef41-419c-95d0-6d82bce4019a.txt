Diffuse tenderness to palpation (TTP)
Normal Breath Sounds bilaterally
Clinically Stable
Initially observed w/o Tx.  A right thoracostomy tube was inserted when no significant decrease in size of PTX was observed after the first 24 hours.
• Initial Chest X-ray
-On initial evaluation, no evident pneumothorax (PTX) nor displaced fracture
-On close examination, subtle increased visualization of the right heart border with associated relative regional lucency

• Trauma Scan - CT
-Anterior pneumothorax comprising approximately 25% of right thorax
-Patchy foci of lung density representing lung contusion
-Representative non-displaced rib fracture

• Initial Upright CXR
-PTX is now in the typical location laterally and superiorly

• Second Upright CXR
-Following minimal change after 24 hours, thoracostomy tube inserted
Anterior Pneumothorax
• Normal
• Pneumothorax
• Skin fold (not confirmed by CT)
19 y.o. man with chest pain following an MVA
The clinicians had no suspicion of pneumothorax and were surprised when the CT results were reported.  Diffuse chest pain is common in trauma patients following an MVA and no decrease in breath sounds was appreciated on physical exam.
