Biopsy demonstrated Classical Hodgkin's Lymphoma of the nodular sclerosing type.
PA and lateral radiographs demonstrate a large lobulated upper mediastinal mass measuring approximately 10 x 13 x 16 cm, projecting predominately to the right, but obscuring the upper margin of the aortic arch.

PET Scan demonstrates multiple foci of activity, including a large region of increased activity in the superior mediastinum.  The spleen demonstrates increased activity.  Increased activity is also seen in the right supraclavicular region, sub-carinal and paraaortic regions, as well as multiple rib and vertebral lesions.
