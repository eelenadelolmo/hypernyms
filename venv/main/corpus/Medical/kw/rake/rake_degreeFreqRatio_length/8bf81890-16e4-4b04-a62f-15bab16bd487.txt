PHYSICAL EXAM:	There was a 8cm x 3.5cm lesion on the temperoparietal scalp. Centrally within the lesion were areas of alopecia and five firm, mobile 0.5-2cm subcutaneous nodules and several well healed biopsy sites. No bruits were appreciated on auscultation. 
Laboratory: Bone scan and cerebral angiography were normal. MRI revealed an enhancing lesion in the deep soft tissues of the scalp covering a 9cm x 9cm area overlying the left parietal and frontal bones, superficial to the temporalis muscle, with no evidence of bony involvement. 
HISTOPATHOLOGY: Proliferations of nevomelanocytes, dendritic and spindled cells, and Schwann cells extending from the lower dermis through the subcutaneous fat to the galea.
Surgical excision of the entire lesion
NEUROCRISTIC HAMARTOMA (1997 Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, Case#20) submitted by: David S. Mezebish, LCDR, MC (FS), USN
This 27 year old white female has a lifelong history of alopecia on the left scalp, and a 10-15 year history of slowly growing, slightly tender subcutaneous left scalp nodules.
