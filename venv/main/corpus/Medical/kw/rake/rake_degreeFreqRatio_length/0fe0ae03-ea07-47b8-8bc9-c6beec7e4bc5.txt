Texto: 
Lower abdominal pain.
Initial labs: WBC's: 24.4, Neut: 94
Follow-up labs: Positive for c. Difficile.
The patient was treated with Flagyl and labs post treatment were negative.
In the sigmoid colon there is a thickened colonic wall with preserved, but thickened, hausta.  Contrast is present between the thickened folds.  These findings were all left sided within the colon, extending up the descending colon.
PSEUDOMEMBRANOUS COLITIS
Colitis of other causes:

Vascular insult - IMA
Ulcerative colitis
35 y/o male who was 6 days status post removal of orthopaedic hardware presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain and diarrhea.  The patient was sent to radiology to rule out appendicitis.
This case is not specific for pseudomembranous colitis, lacking the pan colonic involvment and "toxic megacolon" appearance of dilatation often present.  The clinical senario of association with having received peri-surgical antibiotics guided diagnosis.
