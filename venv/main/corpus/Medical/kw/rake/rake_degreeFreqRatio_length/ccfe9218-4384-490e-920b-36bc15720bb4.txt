Texto: 
Barium swallow (1): Following ingestion of low- density barium and later, high-density barium (double contrast study), the pt. was found to have a diffuse abnormal mucosal pattern with shaggy margins to the esophagus. Multiple longitudinal filling defects. The entire thoracic esophagus is involved, but was most marked in the distal half. Changes are consistent with esophagitis.

Barium swallow (2): On comparison to film #1, the patient is noted to have some minimal improvement, however the disease remains widespread. Equivocal evidence of improvement.

CT chest: No previous scans. Esophagus is normal caliber throughout most of its length. Contrast column is more lateral than posterior, which is not in itself abnormal. No definite abnormality of the esophagus which could explain the symptoms, but this is not very sensitive for mucosal abnormalities.

Barium swallow (3): No residual evidence of esophagitis. The diffuse esophageal changes seen in December have regressed in their entirety and the appearance of the esophagus is regarded as normal, with no residual inflammatory changes.
Esophagitis (Candida albicans)
Patient is a 17yo African American male with a past medical history significant for hemophilia and transfusion acquired HIV infection with low T4 count, who is medically managed at a hospital. He presents to the hospital with a chief complaint of painful swallowing for one week with persistent oral thrush infection.
Esophagitis is one of the predominant disease processes that a radiologist encounters in a radiologic evaluation of the esophagus. As with any medical study, the primary objective of esophagography is to detect esophagitis at its earliest possible stage, and to determine the underlying cause of infection. In immunosuppressed patients, to include patients with HIV, opportunistic (ie, fungal or viral) esophagitis has been recognized with increasing frequency.
     Candida albicans, an organism common to the human oral flora, is the most common cause of fungal esophagitis. On occasion, other species such as C. tropicalis, C. glabrete, or C. parapsilosis have been known to cause disease. Herpes simplex virus and CMV have also been seen with increasing frequency. In mildly inmunosuppressed patients candida esophagitis is usually asymptomatic, but in patients with severe immunosuppression, dysphagia is the most common presenting complaint. Further presenting complaints can include oral lesions, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, and weight loss. In the case of this patient, he presented with similar symptoms of painful swallowing for one week with persistent oral thrush.
     Technique for examination can include the double-contrast esophagogram, which is obtained as a biphasic examination that includes double-contrast and single-contrast views of the esophagus. In this particular study, the patient was asked to swallow low-density barium and subsequently effervescent liquid, followed by high-density barium. Studies are performed under the guidance of fluoroscopy. Double-contrast esophagography permits a detailed assessment of the esophageal mucosa, and provides the radiologist with a relatively sensitive technique for detecting subtle manifestations of esophagitis. Some of these findings can include mucosal nodules, plaques, or shallow ulcers. The classic appearance of C. albicans using this study technique is discrete plaque-like lesions oriented longitudinally, producing linear or irregular filling defects with distinct margins from trapped barium. As seen in this patient, a diffuse abnormal mucosal pattern with linear striations and shaggy margins are seen on the barium swallow, suggestive of esophagitis.
     Unfortunately, typical lesions are not always seen. The esophogram may be normal or may have only nonspecific findings such ag stricture, ulceration, polyps, mucosal bridging or fistulas. Furthermore, even when the diagnosis of esophagitis is possible radiographically, endoscopy must be performed to obtain an etiology.
