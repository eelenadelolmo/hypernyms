Texto: 
Physical exam significant for right chest wall deformity, shortened right upper extremity, and syndactyly of all digits on the right hand.
As patient's with Poland's syndrome are normal, except for their anatomic deformities, reconstructive surgeries are the only treatment.
Non-contrast axial CT images of the chest demonstrate absence of all right sided pectoralis muscles.  There is hypoplasia of the right latissimus dorsi.  There are several hypoplastic ribs on the right.  The right lung is small but with normal parenchyma.
