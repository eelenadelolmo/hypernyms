AP and coned-down AP and lateral views of the right tibia and fibula demonstrate hardware from total knee arthroplasty without evidence of hardware complication in visualized portion of prosthesis. In the distal fibula, there is subtle graying of the cortex and periosteal reaction consistent with a healing stress fracture. Bone mineralization is decreased.
