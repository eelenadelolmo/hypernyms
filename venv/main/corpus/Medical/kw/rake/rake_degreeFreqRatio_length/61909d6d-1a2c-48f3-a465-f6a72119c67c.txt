serum creatinine - 10
On the PA view there is proximal and distal clavicular resorption.  The lateral view demonstrates vertebral body endplate band-like sclerosis and resorption.
Renal Osteodystrophy
Differential Diagnosis and Discussion

Rugger Jersey Spine
	Pimary Hyperparathyroidsm
	Renal Osteodystrophy (secondary hyperparathyroidism)
        Osteopetrosis

Destruction of Distal Clavicle
	Hyperparathyroidism
	Rheumatoid arthritis
	Gout
	Scleroderma
	Osteomyelitis
	Post-traumatic osteolysis
45 year old male with chronic renal failure presents for routine chest radiographs.
Given that the patient has chronic renal failure and both a rugger jersey spine and clavical resorption at both ends, renal osteodystrophy is the top differential diagnosis.  Although gout and traumatic osteolysis, as well as rheumatoid arthritis may also be present, the constellation of findings point towards the chronic renal failuire and subsequent hyperparathyroidism as the culprit
