Normal clinical breast exam.
None. Small, benign lesion.
On the initial screening CC and MLO views of the left breast, there is an ill-defined nodular density in the middle third, inferomedial, new from the prior exam. Patient was recalled for additional evaluation.  Spot compression views reveal a well-cirmscribed nodule/mass. Lesion was further localized with a true lateral view and evaluated with ultrasound, demonstrating an anechoic mass with no complexity and good posterior enhancement.
Simple Cyst, Left Breast
Before ultrasound:
-Cyst
-Fibroadenoma
-Papilloma
-Well-circumscribed malignancy

After ultrasound:
-Simple cyst. (Roentgen Classic)
Routine screening mammogram, patient called back for further evaluation of abnormality.  Clinically asymptomatic with respect to the breasts. No personal or family history of breast cancer and no other significant risk factors.
The teaching point of this case, beyond the typical presentation of a simple breast cyst, is to address the value of additional mammographic views in problem-solving.  In order to accurately target breast ultrasound to a small lesion, the location of the lesion within the breast must be as acurately identified as possible.  This is typically accomplished by obtaing a true medial-to-lateral projection and lining up the 3 views (CC-ML-MLO) with the nipple line along a horizontal plane.  A straight line should be able to be drawn through the lesion, defining it's position on the 3rd view.  The spot magnification views, while helpful for characterizing the lesion, are less helpful for localization.

In this case, the lesion remained ill-defined on the true ML lateral view.  Because the lesion is in the medial half of the breast, a lateral-to-medial view (LM) would therefore place the lesion close to the film and likely sharpen definition-- as was true in this case.  The lesion could be accurately located to the 9:00 position and proven by ultrasound to represent a simple cyst.
