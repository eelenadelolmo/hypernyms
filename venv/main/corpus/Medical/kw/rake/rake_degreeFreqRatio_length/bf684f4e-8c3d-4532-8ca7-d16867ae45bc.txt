Texto: 
Treatment of traumatic aortic injury used to consist of open surgical repair with or without cardiac bypass.  Endovascular stent grafts are becoming more common due to the decreased morbidity and mortality compared with open surgical repair in the multitrauma patient.  The best follow-up modality and interval, as well as duration is not exactly known as this is a relatively new treatment.

Axial CT with IV contrast demontrates enlargment of the proximal descending aorta distal to the left subclavian artery with intimal flap involving the entire diameter of the proximal descending aorta.  A large amount of mediastinal hematoma is present.

Aortogram demonstrates a large pseudoaneurysm distal to the left subclavian artery.  Aortic stent graft placement was performed with exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm.
