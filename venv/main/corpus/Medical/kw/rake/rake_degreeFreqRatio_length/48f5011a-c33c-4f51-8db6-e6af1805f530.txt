Williams-Campbell syndrome
This is a 51 year-old patient with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx treated with radiation and three cycles of 5-FU/cisplatin who presents to the oncology clinic for follow up.  Patient denied cough, fevers, chills, weight loss, hemoptysis.  Patient denied prior alcohol/tobacco use.  Patient does have a recent history of treated bronchopneumonia.
This case is unique because there are no CT criteria for bronchial wall inflammation.  This could be related to the fact that the patient is undergoing chemotherapy and thus immunocompromised.
