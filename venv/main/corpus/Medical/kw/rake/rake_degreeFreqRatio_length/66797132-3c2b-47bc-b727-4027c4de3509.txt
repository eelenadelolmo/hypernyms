Diffuse abdominal pain on palpation.
Saline flushes were stopped, catheter tip was repositioned.  Fistula showed evidence of resolving and decision was made to pull catheter on POD#16.  Patient's WBC continued to decline and she remained afebrile with no pain.

Persistent Ceco-Abdominal Fecal Fistula
Persistence of fistula likely due to repeated flushing with saline and presence of catheter.
10 year-old female presented with 3 days nausea, vomiting and periumbilical pain that progressed to RLQ.   Appendiceal fecolith found on abdominal ultrasound.  Patient underwent laparoscopic appendectomy.   Post-operatively, patient developed fevers, recurrence of pain and elevated WBC to 24.7 on POD#6.
Post-operative appendectomy intra-abdominal abscess incidence has been found to be 5-20% (1).  Options for treatment include open vs. percutaneous drainage, with the latter being preferred.   After the initial drain placement the output in this patient was minimal (<5mL) and the fistula was likely kept open my the TID saline flushes (5mL not counted in output).  On POD#13 the catheter tip was repositioned away from the fistula tract by rotating the catheter.   Saline flushes were stopped at this time.  On POD#16 the fistula was minimally patent (image not available) and the drainage catheter was removed.  While there is a risk that the abscess may recur, the patient was asymptomatic and the WBC was normal.  It was reasoned that the removal of the catheter would further promote closure of the space.
