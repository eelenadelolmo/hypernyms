Afebrile.  Pelvic examination within normal limits without palpable adnexal mass or cervical motion tenderness.  No vaginal discharge.

WBC 9.5 (4.5-10.8)
Qualitative serum HCG negative
Salpingostomy and/or tubal reconstruction are commonly performed for infertile women with hydrosalpinges. When hydrosalpinges are encountered during hysterosalpingography, some gynecologists recommend a course of antibiotic therapy.
Pelvic sonography demonstrates a dilated (9 mm diameter), fluid-filled, thick-walled, avascular tubular structure adjacent to the left ovary.  No internal echoes or fluid-debris levels are evident.

Fluoroscopic images obtained during hysterosalpingography demonstrate preferential filling of the dilated left fallopian tube without evidence of free flow of contrast material from the distal end consistent with tubal occlusion.
