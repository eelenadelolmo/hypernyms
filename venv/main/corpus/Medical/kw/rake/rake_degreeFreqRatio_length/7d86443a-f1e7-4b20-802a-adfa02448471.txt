Vitals: T 99.1, HR 88, BP 137/84, 20R, 96% 4L NC
Gen: Pt in no acute distress, alert and oriented x’s 3
CVS: rrr with no r/m/g
Pulm: ctab no r/w/r, no decreased lung sounds throughout
HEENT: unremarkable, no tracheal deviation
Ext: 2+ pulses throughout, no c/c/e
A pneumodart was placed and subsequent images showed a resolution of the pneumothorax. Pt improved clinically.
Decreased lung markings on superior aspect of right lung field
Pneumothorax
• Pneumothorax
• Tension Pneumothorax
• Poor quality/technique CXR
• Skin fold mimic
63 yo man s/p epidural placement in T3-T4 interspaces for chronic back pain relief. Now has SOB for past 4 hours beginning shortly after receiving epidural procedure.
Primary Spontaneous PTX: rupture of apical pleural blebs
Secondary Spontaneous PTX: known underlying lung disease; COPD, TB, Pneumonia
Traumatic PTX: including friendly and non-friendly trauma (ie. iatrogenic)

Epidural induced pneumothorax is rare but can be found in the literature in the form of case reports.
