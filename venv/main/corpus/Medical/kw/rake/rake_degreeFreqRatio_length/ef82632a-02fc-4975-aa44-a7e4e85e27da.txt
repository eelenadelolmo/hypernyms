Lumbar Puncture: CSF was sent for analysis of cell count, gram stain culture, protein, and glucose, the results of which show an elevated number of nucleated cells showing 71% lymphocytes. The glucose was within normal range at 63 and the protein was elevated at 86. LDH and lactic acid were
normal and gram stain showed no organisms. No blood.
