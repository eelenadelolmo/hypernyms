Lumbar Puncture: CSF was sent for analysis of cell count, gram stain culture, protein, and glucose, the results of which show an elevated number of nucleated cells showing 71% lymphocytes. The glucose was within normal range at 63 and the protein was elevated at 86. LDH and lactic acid were
normal and gram stain showed no organisms. No blood.
Patient improved over 10 days.
No follow-up MRI obtained to date
• Multiple lesions in white matter, pons, midbrain, and basal ganglia.
• Lesion have elevated T2 signal with minimal mass effect.
• No enhancement
Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis
• Multiple Sclerosis
• Lyme disease
• Bechets disease
• ADEM (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis)
