Vital signs: 127/85 61bpm 68‚Äù 206lb BMI 31.32

CV: RRR, normal S1/S2. No murmurs. No carotid bruit. Normal peripheral pulses.  No peripheral edema. 

EKG: Sinus bradycardia at 57bpm, otherwise normal.
The plan for this patient is to follow his aortic dissection with cardiac-gated CT imaging at regular intervals. He is currently being managed with medication for blood pressure control, and the dissection has been stable over the intial 6 months since onset.

Regarding the PDA, since it is long-standing and has at this point only caused mild dilation of the pulmonary artery, there is no plan to correct it. The patient has no symptoms from his PDA, either at rest or with exertion, and indeed no murmur is appreciable on exam.
Cardiac-gated CTA images in multiple planes demonstrate a patent ductus arteriosus, shown by a small contrast-enhanced vessel connecting the descending aorta to the pulmonary artery. Patency of vessel is demonstrated by a jet of contrast spilling into the pulmonary artery at its connection with the ductus arteriosus. 
Of note, you can see changes in the proximal descending aortic wall indicative of this patient's stable aneurysm/dissection.
Patent Ductus Arteriosus
Patent ductus arteriosus
Intraarterial fistula
56 y.o. man, a commercial airline pilot, presented with with acute onset of severe chest pain, radiating to the back. 
PMH: HTN, HLP, Type B (descending aorta) thoracic aortic dissection
FamHx: noncontributory
Meds: Metoprolol, Amlodipine, HCTZ, Atorvastatin, Omeprazole
Allergies: NKDA
Currently, this incidental finding of PDA is of little clinical consequence, as the patient does not have symptoms at this time. However, if he were to develop symptoms such as exercise intolerance or differential cyanosis, it would become important to evaluate the shunt fraction with a functional study or transthoracic echocardiogram.
