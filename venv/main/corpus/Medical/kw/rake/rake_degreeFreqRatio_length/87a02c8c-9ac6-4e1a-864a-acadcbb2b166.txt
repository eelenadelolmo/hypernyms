Texto: 
Firm, tender palpable mass lateral right knee; Palpable mass lateral distal femur just proximal to the left knee.
The patient was referred to a pediatric orthopedist who will continue to follow these lesions.
Right knee radiograph demonstrates a prominent pedunculated bony projection pointing away from the knee joint, with apparent continuity with cortex and marrow. Questionable cortical irregularity of the inferior stalk is suspicious for a fracture.

Multiple exostoses project from numerous additional sites on bone survey.
Multiple Osteochondromatosis
Hereditary Multiple Osteochondromatoses
Usually characteristic. Myositis ossificans could be included if less diffuse involvement.
17 year old male presents with persistent severe right knee pain after being kicked in the lateral knee 2 days earlier.
There was no known family history of additional family members with signs or symptoms of osteochondromatosis.
