nl physical exam and nl labs
Patient was treated with CHOP+Rituxan and is awaiting bone marrow transplant.
Digital Fluroscopic images demonstrate persistent separation of small bowel loops in the LUQ that are only minimally mobile with compression.

CT of the abdomen demonstrates sig mesenteric adenopathy in a bed of fatty mesenteric panniculus and aneurismal dilitation of the small bowel

CT/PET scan of the abd and pelvis demonstrates sig increase in uptake in the small bowel and mesentery indicating diffuse involvement.  Rounded areas of sparing corresponsing to low density on CT are likely areas of necrosis.
Small Bowel Lymphoma - diffuse large B cell
Infection
Ischemia
Edema
Neoplasm
 - lymphoma
 - adenocarcinoma
 - metastatic disease
48 year old male presents with LUQ pain and nausea for the past 4 months.
This case represents a good example of small bowel lymphoma and the modalities used to explore this disease.
