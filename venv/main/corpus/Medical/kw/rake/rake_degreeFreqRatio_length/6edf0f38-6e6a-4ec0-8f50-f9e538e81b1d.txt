No focal neurologic deficits.
This patient had an incidental mass found on a head CT after a fall.  He has no history of seizures or focal neurologic deficits.  The patient elected to have a gross total resection of the mass.  He continues to be free of seizures and focal neurologic deficits at one month post-op.
Right frontal lobe lesion without midline shift or sulcal effacement, measuring 3.5 x 2.9 x 3.0 cm.  On CT, the lesion low attenuation compared  to brain.  On MRI, it has corresponding low signal on T1 and high on T2.  There is no post-contrast enhancement and demonstrates no suppression on FLAIR.
Diffuse Astrocytoma WHO Gr 2
• Diffuse astrocytoma (Gr 2 or Gr 3)
• Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma (PXA)
• Pilocytic astrocytoma
• Anaplastic astrocytoma
• DNET (dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor)
• Neurocysticercosis
• Metastasis
This patient is a 35 year old man who presents after a fall.  He has no history of seizures or focal neurologic deficits.
Diffuse astrocytomas are Grade 2 astrocytic tumors according to the WHO classification of CNS masses (1).  They often present in the 4th-5th decade of life (2), with most being found in the frontal lobe (40%) (3).  Patients typically present late and have a history of seizures.  On MRI, these lesions are typically bright on T2, but do not enhance and do not suppress on FLAIR.  Occasionally, high T2 intensity can be see surrounding the lesion.  This represents infiltration of the astrocytoma, but it can be mistaken for edema.

These neoplasms have a variable course, with some progressing malignantly to higher grade gliomas (anaplastic or GBMs).  Indicators that confer better prognostic include: higher degree of function on the KPS scale (>80), location of the lesion in non-eloquent locations, size of the lesion less than 4cm, and age less than 50 (2).  Similar patients with all of these indicators have a pre-op 10 year survival of 90% (2).

Resection of these lesions is controversial.  Pathologically, these lesions are often infiltrative.   If gross total resection is chosen by the neurosurgeon and the patient, >50% will recur in 5 years (4).

MR Spectroscopy

In some cases, it may be difficult to determine whether or not an abnormality on MRI represents a benign or malignant lesion.  Proton MR Spectroscopy (MRS or 1HMRS) can be a useful  adjunct to MRI.  MRS uses the same nuclear magnetic resonance mechanisms used in MRI, but instead of creating an image, it creates a spectrum representing the biochemical composition a region of interest.  Lesions have unique biochemical signatures that can assist in diagnosis.

Normal brain tissue has major peaks for the molecules myo-inositol, choline, creatinine, and N-acetylaspartate.  On the spectra, these are read left to right, and generally will have a upward angle of 45 degrees (5).  This angle is known as the Hunter’s Angle (5).  The angle is deranged when any of these compounds are greater or less than normal, and this can indicate pathology.  

Examining these peaks closer, choline on MRS represents cellular turn over, while N-acetylaspartate represents normal neural tissue (5).  An increase of choline and a decrease of N-acetylaspartate can represent neoplasia (5).  Elevated lactate can be seen on the spectrum, which is also a useful indicator for neoplasia (5).

MRS takes experience to understand and interpret correctly.  Certain other molecules in the system and physiologic states can make MRS more complex.  For instance,  the neonatal brain can look similar to neoplasia due to increased cellular turnover.  Additionally, alcohol, mannitol, glucose, and many common medications can be present in the patient and the region of interest, changing the appearance of the spectrum with their unique chemical shifts (5).  

Unfortunately, despite 20 years of existence, there is scant research in this aspect of MRI, despite it being a noninvasive and relatively inexpensive adjunct to MR imaging that physicians already request (5).  At the same time, small, but growing utility has been found in the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of pathologic conditions of the brain.  Some research has also been conducted in various other tissues, including the kidney, liver, and breast, but more research is into this technology is needed to improve clinical applicability.
