Patient appeared well and did not have abnormal laboratory values on her workup.
No treatment or followup are necessary, as long as, the patient remains asymptomatic.
A three-phase CT scan of the liver was performed.  There is a 5.6 cm focal liver lesion is present within the right lobe of the liver on the CT scan.  Chunky internal calcifications are present.  There is the suggestion of peripheral enhancement and fill in on delayed images. 

The red blood cell scan demonstrates abnormal radiotracer accumulation within the anteroinferior aspect of the liver, which correlates to the hypodense, partially clacified mass identififed on the CT scan.

46-year-old female presented to the emergency room with right lower quadrant pain.  A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed at that time - but, there was no evidence for appendicitis on the scan.  However, a liver lesion was incidentally found and the patient was referred for further imaging.
Cavernous malformations (hemangiomas) are the most common benign tumor affecting the liver with a reported incidence of approximately 2%.  The increased use of noninvasive imaging has lead to an increased detection of asymptomatic lesions, such as in this case.  Hepatic hemangiomas can occur at any age, but are more common in older patients, with female-to-male ratio of 4-6:1.   Female patients tend to present at a younger age and with larger tumors.  There is no association with oral contraceptive use, as with hepatic adenomas.
Hemangiomas are composed of irregular or atypical masses of blood vessels.  The etiology is unknown.  The classic CT appearance is that of a hypodense lesion that enhances gradually with centripedal fill in over time.  The differential diagnosis for hemangiomas includes other benign or malignant hepatic lesions such as focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatic adenoma, hepatic cysts, metastatic disease, or hepatocellular carcinoma.  When the three-phase CT appearance of a hepatic lesion is not typical for a hemangioma, further imaging with a nuclear medicine tagged red blood cell scan can be performed for more definitive diagnosis.  This case demonstrates a slightly atypical appearance of a hemngioma with internal calcifications.  Further imaging with the nuclear medicine scan gives a more definitive diagnosis.
Unless the lesion is large (greater than 10 cm) or there is evidence of bleeding, no further work up or treatment is typically required.
