Renal chromophobe carcinoma eosinophile type that perforates renal capsule and infiltrates perirenal fat tissue
Treated with left radical nephrectomy
• Scout abdominal scan from a comuter tomography  demonstrates a radio-opaque lobular mass  projected in the left renal fossa. 

• MDCT shows a heterogeneous mass arising from the left kidney
• There is irregular enhancement after IV contrast
Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma, eosinophile type, that perforates renal capsule and infiltrates perirenal fat tissue
• Renal Cell Carcinoma
* Oncocytoma
• Transitional Cell Carcinoma
40 y.o. woman with evolution over one month or lower urinary tract symptoms, left renal pain, hematuria, and no improvement with treatment.
Renal Cell Carcinoma:
Incidence 80-90% of all renal malignant primaries in adults.
Arises from proximal tubular cells; 30% found incidentally with imaging.
Tumor growth pattern: papillary (best prognosis); trabecular/tubular/cystic/solid (poorer prognosis). Predisposing factors: tobacco, von Hippel-Lindau disease, hemodialysis, acquired cystic disease of uremia.
The most common sites of metastases are the lung (55%), lymph nodes, liver, bone, adrenals, contralateral kidney, brain, heart, spleen. It?s important to know that 28% of patients have clinically apparent multiple distant metastases at presentation! 
Radiology findings in CT: mostly hterogeneous enhancement (due to cystic areas or necrosis), subcapsular/perinephric hemorrhage. MRI best modality to assess stage III+IV disease: low to medium signal intensity on T1WI; hyperintense areas are usually due to hemorrhage. Heterogeneous signal intensity on T2WI.
Staging:
    I: Confined to within renal capsule
   II: Extension into perinephric fat but confined to Gerota fascia
  IIIA: Extension into renal vein or IVC
 IIIB: Positive lymph nodes
 IIIC: Extension into renal vein + lymph nodes
 IVA: Extensio into adjacent organs( other than ipsilateral adrenal)
 IVB: Distant metastases

Treatment and prognosis: Recurrence in 11% after 10 years. Radical nephrectomy has a 2-5% operative mortality. Tumor stage and histological grade are the most important prognosticators!

Chromophobe Carcinoma of Kidney:

A distinct type of renal cell carcinoma
5% All
Males= females in contradistinction to classic RCC where male 2-3:1 females
Unlike other Renal cell carcinomas can be hypovascular on imaging
Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome a risk factor for chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and these patients need to be screened
Can look identical to oncocytoma, and in case reports has coexisted with this.
