11 yo girl with "failure to thrive".   The child has had increased hunger recently, but eats only small amounts at a time because she gets full quickly and her “belly aches”.  The mother stated that that the child had always had a round belly and also suffered from “low iron” for quite some time.
This patient had incomplete tumor resection and has been treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.  She has no progression of disease to date.
