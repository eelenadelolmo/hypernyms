This is a normal congenital variant, and typically is asymptomatic and does not require treatment.
â€¢ PA Chest radiograph: demonstrates a oval opacity superimposed over the the right superior vena cava (SVC).

â€¢ CT w/IV contrast: demonstrates a dilated azygous vein and there is no visualization of the intrahepatic segment of the inferior vena cava (IVC).

â€¢ This patient also has poly-splenia, which is a known companion abnormality.
Azygous Continuation of the Inferior Vena Cava
Differential of dilated azygous vein also includes: 
â€¢ obstructed SVC or IVC
â€¢ CHF (congestive heart failure)
â€¢ constrictive pericarditis
â€¢ overhydration or fluid overload (e.g. resuscitation)
â€¢ aneurysmal dilatation.
40 year old woman, previously healthy, presents to the emergency room with chest pain.
