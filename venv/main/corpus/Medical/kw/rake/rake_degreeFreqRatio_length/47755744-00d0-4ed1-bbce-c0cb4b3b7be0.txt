Texto: 
Patient is afebrile with normal vital signs.  Labs were normal to include complete blood count and urinalysis.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis using stone protocol was performed to evaluated for kidney stones.
In this case, no further followup or treatment is needed or recommended.  Larger myelolipomas have rarely hemorrhaged requiring surgical removal.  In cases with a more confusing picture, surgical removal would be performed.
Round, well-circumscribed, 4.2 cm mass arising from the right adrenal gland containing discrete foci of low attenuation density measuring -52 Hounsfield units.  No calcifications were identified.
Adrenal Myelolipoma
Adrenal Myelolipoma is the diagnosis in this case due to presence of pure fat in the tumor.
In cases were fat is not so apparent, differential diagnosis could include:
1. Adrenal adenoma
2. Adrenal metastasis
3. Lymphoma
4. Pheochromacytoma
5. Retroperitoneal sarcoma involving the perirenal space may also simulate an adrenal fatty tumor.
44 year old male seen in the emergency room with left sided flank pain radiating to the left groin.  Patient denied prior history of kidney stone disease.
The myelolipoma was an incidental finding in this case, as it often is.  The patient was not found to have nephrolithiasis or an obstructing stone, but did have signs suggesting recent passage of a left urinary stone including mildly ectatic ureter and mild perinephric fat stranding.
