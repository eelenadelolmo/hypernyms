Right sided scrotal fullness with palpable dilation of the veins.

No labs at this time.
As the cyst was determined to be stable over the course of 3 years, no treatment or follow-up was recommended as long as the pt remained asymptomatic.  This was not related to his right sided varicocele.
There was a simple cortical renal cyst within the mid right kidney.
Simple Renal Cyst
-Renal Cyst
-Malignancy
Pt presented to his PCM complaining of right scrotal discomfort.  He described it as an intermittant, achy pain that seemed to worsen after prolonged periods of standing, and be relieved with lying down.  He stated that it seemed to occur more frequently over time.  He was diagnosed with a varicocele and advised to undergo an abdominal CT for further work up due to the unusual presentation of this being a unilateral right sided varicocele.
