Address possibility of malabsorption contributing to weight loss and vitamin deficiency in this patient.  This may be secondary to bacterial overgrowth from "blind loop syndrome," whereby stagnant bacterial in the diverticuli consume dietary intake and B12, while subacute inflammation may adversely effect intestinal uptake mechanisms.

Empiric antibiotic therapy may help with malabsorption and abdominal pain.  Promotility agents, bulk forming agents, and hi-fiber diet may help reduce intestinal transit times.

Monitor for and rule out complications of small bowel diverticulosis to include perforation, obstruction or pseudoobstruction, bleeding, or anemia.
SBFT demonstrates innumerable small bowel diverticula; enhanced abdominal CT demonstrates similar findings (but more difficult to perceive -- white arrows mark the diverticula)

87 y/o female with vague epigastric discomfort and increased abdominal bloating for several months.  She has suffered a 10lb weight loss over the past year and now weighs 90 lbs.  She has had increased bowel frequency with 3-5 normal BM's/day.  She denies fever, nausea, vomiting.

This patient appears to be suffering from chronic vague abdominal pain, bloating, weight loss and B12 deficiency, all of which can be attributed to significant duodenal and jejunal diverticulosis.  The vast majority of cases are asymptomatic.  In others the symptoms are vague and chronic and include malabsorption, anemia either due to B12 deficiency or blood loss, epigastric pain, bloating, and diarrhea or constipation.  Uncommonly, small bowel diverticulosis may become complicated by perforation, major bleeding, obstruction or diverticulitis and require inpatient or surgical treatment.
