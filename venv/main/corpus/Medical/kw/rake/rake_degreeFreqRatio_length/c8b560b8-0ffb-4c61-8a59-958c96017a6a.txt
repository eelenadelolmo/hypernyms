Surgical resection of meningioma.  No treatment for the cavernous malformations.
• CT calcified mass right basal ganglia and a hemispheric convexity mass almost isodense with brain

• MRI  Large right basal ganglionic/temporal  heterogeneous black-and-white mass lesion with remarkably little mass effect.  A similar but smaller lesion is seen in the base of left frontal lobe.  There is a right frontal convexity extraaxial lesion, hemispheric, with an enhancing "dural tail".

1) Meningioma
