On physical exam, there was no gross bone deformity. However, there was a moderate amount of edema with the most prominent being over the lateral malleolus. There was severe lateral perimalleolar tenderness noted, as well as moderate medial perimalleolar tenderness. The patient was unable to bear weight on the affected foot. No open wounds were recorded. Both passive and active range of motion were limited secondary to pain. The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial artery pulses were 2+ along with a normal sensory exam.
This patient was discharged with a cast for ankle immobilization and follow-up was arranged with orthopaedic surgery. A few days later, he underwent an open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF).
The standard radiographic series (AP, lateral, mortise) was performed. There was an oblique fracture of the distal fibula that extended approximately 6 mm proximal from the tibiotalar joint. There was also a disruption of the supratalar joint with a measured 9 mm medial clear space.
Low Danis-Weber type C fracture
Traumatic fracture
33 year old male presented to the Emergency Department of a private community hospital with right ankle pain. It is unclear as to the exact mechanism of injury but findings were consistent with a forceful abduction with external rotation of his ankle. An example of such an injury would be a soccer player’s foot hitting the ground in an attempt to kick the ball. The patient’s pain was localized to both the lateral and medial malleoli. There was no reported history of diabetes or metabolic bone disease. No history of prior trauma to the ankle. The patient denied any use of steroids in the past.
All Danis-Weber type C fractures require an orthopedic consultation in the Emergency Department. General treatment is ORIF with or without a syndesmotic screw. Vascular supply to the ankle and foot may become compromised by the development of a compartment syndrome or direct injury to blood vessels from bone fragments. Of note, the mortise view, which is taken with the ankle in 15 to 25 degrees of internal rotation, is most important for evaluating the congruity of the articular surfaces between the dome of the talus and the mortise. The lines formed between the articular surfaces should be parallel throughout the tibiotalar and tibiofibular components of the joint and the medial clear space should not exceed 4mm.
