Change in patient&#39;s awareness of the feeling and shape of her breasts.
The FDA and the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, advise removal of ruptured SGBIs whether intra or extracapsular. SGBI - silicone gel breast implant
There is rupture of both silicone breast implants.  Intracapsular rupture is present on the left showing a good example of the "linguini" sign.  Strong chemical shift artifact is present in the right breast due to the MR signal differences (frequency) in the silicone, hydrogen associated with silicone and pure water.  No extracapsular rupture.
