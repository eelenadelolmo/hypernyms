Texto: 
Left upper extremity weakness and numbness for past couple days
Treatment: ASA, heparin if no bleed and large vessel atherothrombosis, thrombolytic (t-PA) if within 3 hours of symptom onset
Disposition: Often long term inpatient stroke rehabilitation
23 Jan: NON-CONTRAST Head CT (from emergency dept)
-regional hypoattenuation in right temporal lobe, extending from cerebral cortex into white matter
-loss of gray/white matter differentiation
-sulcal effacement of right temporal-parietal lobes (may represent ischemia and resultant edema)
-some chronic microvascular ischemic disease of periventricular white matter
-ventricles and cisterns preserved, no intracranial hemorrhage or mass
-likely represents infarct of unknown time course (subacute vs. acute)
-MRI recommended

24 Jan: Brain MRI (from emergency dept)
-axial DWI—increased signal in right posterior parietal lobe=restricted diffusion
-ADC map--corresponding decreased signal
-consistent with acute stroke in right posterior parietal lobe

24 Jan: CAROTID US
-echogenic calcified plaque in right carotid bulb and proximal internal carotid artery with 50-69% stenosis with elevated velocities in internal carotid
-hemodynamically insignificant stenosis in left carotid bulb

24 Jan: TRANSTHORACIC ECHO (no images shown)
-normal left and right ventricular size and function
-negative bubble study

25 Jan: CT ANGIOGRAPHY W/ CONTRAST (sagittal view)
-large calcified plaque in right carotid bifurcation and proximal ICA 
-hemodynamically significant stenosis of 64%

26 Jan: NON-CONTRAST Head CT (following worsening left sided weakness and sensory loss)
-hypodensity of right temporal lobe
-two new foci of calcification within the right sylvian fissure, not present on previous exams, likely represent further acute thromboemboli
-more prominent ventricles and cisterns
-no intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect

28 Jan: Brain MRI (following worsening left sided weakness and sensory loss)
-DWI—interval increase in size of signal in right temporal-parietal region
-ADC map—corresponding decrease in signal
Ischemic stoke in right temporal-parietal lobes secondary to emboli from carotid bulb atheroma
Ischemic stroke (embolus, thrombus, arterial dissection)
Hemorrhagic stroke
Malignancy
-87 year old woman
-Left upper extremity weakness and numbness for past couple days
-Son says her left face is “droopy”
-No documented medical history
-On no medications
Etiology of ischemic stroke:
-cardioemboli
-carotid occlusion
-arterial dissection
-local arterial thrombosis

Middle cerebral artery most common destination with
contralateral hand, arm and face weakness and sensory deficits, and spatial neglect--especially if the infarct is in the right parietal lobe resulting in left sided neglect as seen in this patient

Imaging in ischemic stroke patients:
-Noncontrast CT to rule out hemorrhage/mass, some early signs of infarction, yet relatively insensitive to acute infarction
-MRI (DWI/ADC map): DWI can detect infarction within minutes of symptom onset with high sens/spec
-CT angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, transthoracic echocardiogram to evaluate vascular integrity
