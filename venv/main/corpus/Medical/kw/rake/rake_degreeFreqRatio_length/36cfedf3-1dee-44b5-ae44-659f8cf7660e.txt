Upon arrival, he was able to follow commands and admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.  A lumbar puncture showed pleocytosis, suggestive of a viral etiology.  HSV PCR was negative.
Patient died on hospital day four.  Patient died from brain herniation.  Viral cultures negative at time of death.
A CT of the head performed on hospital day three following acute decompensation showed mild-to-moderate dilatation of the third and lateral ventricles and slight crowding in the craniocervical junction, possibly secondary to downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils.
Meningoencephalitis, probably viral
(1)Meningitis or meningoencephalitis…many different pathogens can cause this condition, including bacteria (N.meningitidis, S. pneuminiae), viral (enteroviruses, HSV1, HSV2, varicella zoster) and parasitic (Angiostongylus cantonensis, Gnathostoma spinigerum) (2) Empyema…unlikely, as no evidence on MRI or CT.  Seen as fluid collections over the convexities or interhemisperically[1], (3) Toxoplasmosis….can cause encephalopathic changes like those in this patient, usually not as acute.  No evidence on MRI….seem as ring enhancing lesions in basal ganglia, (4) pituitary adenoma apoplexy….can rarely present as meningitis due to meningeal irritation [3].  No evidence on MRI or CT.
The patient is a 14-year old boy who presented to an outside hospital with acute mental changes.  A CT performed at the outside hospital was normal.
