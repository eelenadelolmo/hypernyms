Unknow exam.
Labs significant for:
Hemoglobin A1c 6.0-8.0 over past 6months
WBC 13.0-23.9 over past month
Wound cultures negative.
For patients with severe joint destruction, chronic ulcers, and possibly osteomyelitis, amputations are typically involved to prevent systemic infection.  Upon presentation IV vancomycin was begun on this patient, but was later dicontinued after all wound cultures were negative.  Further follow up is unknown.
Two images are submitted.  The one on the right is 6 months prior to the one on the left.  Interval worsening of the joint destruction is evident.  Please see the specific captions for the findings.  However, typical radiographic findings include: joint destruction, disorganization, subluxation, dislocation, heterotopic bone formation, soft tissue swelling, sclerosis, periostitis.  Most of these are found in the images submitted.  Please see captions for specific findings for each image.
Charcot Joint
The term "Charcot joint" is a general term used to describe severe articular abnormalities related to neurologic deficits, regardless of the primary cause.  The following is a list of some of the causes.
1) trauma
2) infection
3) neuropathic osteoarthropathies:
   A) central nervous system disorders (syphilis, syringomyelia, meningo-myelocele, multiple sclerosis, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease)
   B) congenital vascular anomalies
   C) other causes of cord compression, injury, or degeneration 
   D) peripheral neuropathies including diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, amyloidosis, infection, pernicious anemia, trauma, and intra-articular or systemic administration of steroids.
55 yo female with a known long history of diabetes mellitus who presented with acute on chronic foot swelling and draining ulcer.The patient has had a long history of poorly controlled diabetes and peripheral neuropathy
Diabetes is the leading cause of neuropathic osteoarthropathy.  Diabetic neuropathic osteoarthropathy typically appears in patients with long standing poorly controlled diabetes.  In addition to the progressive loss of sensation and repetitive trauma, the findings relate in part to a neurally initiated vascular reflex that leads to increased blood flow.  The fractures, subluxations, and joint destruction may represent the terminal event occuring when repetitive mechanical trauma is applied to a site containing bones made weak and vulnerable by hypervascularity.  This particular patient has had long standing poorly controlled diabetes, evident by her HbA1c levels, and known peripheral diabetic neuropathy.
