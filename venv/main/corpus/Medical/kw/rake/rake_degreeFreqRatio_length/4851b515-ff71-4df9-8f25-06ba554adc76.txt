Pain in the right hip.
For plain films, an anteroposterior radiograph of the pelvis shows the ilioischial and iliopectineal lines and the lateral margin of the anterior and posterior walls.  The posterior oblique radiograph specific to the side in question, which is also called the iliac oblique view, shows the posterior part of the acetabulum and greater sciatic notch to advantage.  The iliac wing is also well seen.  The contralateral posterior oblique view, also called the obturator oblique view, shows the acetabulum in question well, in addition to the obturator foramen.  The anterior portion of the iliopectineal line and posterior wall are also seen to advantage.  Careful evaluation of all views is of the utmost importance in evaluating for fractures.  Resorting to CT or MRI in times of question should not be hesitated.
acetabular fracture
There is no differential in this case.
62 year old male with right hip injury.
This patient fractured both the anterior and posterior columns and the posterior wall.  By analyzing the bony lines on the plain film, a posterior column fracture can diagnosed by disruption of the ilioischial line.  With the CT the complexity of the fracture pattern is revealed.	
This case demonstrates the importance in evaluating the pelvic lines carefully as the fracture was initially missed.  The complexity and number of the fracture types can be daunting to those who do not often use the system.  However, the referenced paper gives a detailed description on how to classify the fracture types, resulting in more comfort dealing with the complex anatomy and fracture pathology.
