Child was taken to the OR for hemicolectomy.  Stress dose steroid replacement was provided.
Plain films of the extremities demonstrate diffuse calcinosis compatible with established diagnosis of juvenile dermatomyositis.

CT scan performed to evaluate abdominal pain shows extensive pneumatosis of the right colon at the hepatic flexure.  Free abdomenal air is noted.

Assymetric perfusion of the kidneys was incidentally discovered and confirmed with repeat delayed scanning of the abdomen done to look for free abdominal air.
Juvenile Dermatomyositis
Bowel Ischemia
Infection in immune compromised patient
Steroid dependent child with systemic weakness and established diagnosis presents with  abdominal pain.  Later clinicians supplied additional history of hematuria.
Vasculitis is associated with dermatomyositis and can cause both the bowel wall ischemia and the differential renal perfusion.  Because the patient is on high dose steroids, the free abdomenal air may have been occult.
