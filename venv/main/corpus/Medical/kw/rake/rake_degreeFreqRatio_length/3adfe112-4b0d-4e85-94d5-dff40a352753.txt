This patient was assessed as a possible surgical candidate, but at the time of this write-up had not elected for surgery. Initial treatment of osteoarthritis is conservative, with a goal of pain reduction and minimization of swelling and disability. At present there are no pharmacologic therapies that prevent the progression of damage due to osteoarthritis. Conservative nonpharmacologic therapies include tailored exercise programs, weight loss (when appropriate), and specially designed shoes. Dietary supplements such as glucosamine and chondroitin may also be useful. Pharmacologic intervention includes non-opioid analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs for long-term pain control, and in severe cases opiates for acute exacerbations. Surgical intervention is considered as a final option in patients with severe symptomatic OA of the hip in which medical management is insufficient, and there is marked interference with daily activities.  Total hip arthroplasty (replacement), may provide marked pain relief as well as significant functional improvement.
AP and frog-leg views of the hips demonstrating marked joint space narrowing bilaterally, especially in the superolateral regions.  There is also evidence of subchondral sclerosis and cyst formation. In the superior aspects of the acetabula, large osteophytes are present bilaterally. 
Both femoral heads demonstrate contour abnormalities consistent with slipped capital femoral epiphyses, the right side greater than the left. 
There is no evidence of flattening or collapse of the femoral heads, and they are well covered by the acetabulum.
Osteoarthritis of the hips bilaterally, secondary to slipped capital femoral epiphyses.
Osteoarthritis
The patient is a 52 year-old African-American male with bilateral DJD secondary to slipped capital femoral epiphyses at a young age.
Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is the displacement of the epiphysis from the femoral neck at the physeal plate. The typical patient is an obese male in early adolescence, although it is not uncommon in obese females. At presentation nearly 20% of cases are bilateral (1), and of those with a unilateral slip 30-60% will eventually have a slip in the contralateral hip. Risk factors include obesity, renal failure, history of radiation therapy, some endocrine abnormalities (GH deficiency and hypothyroidism), and certain genetic disorders (eg, Down syndrome).  SCFE is caused by shearing forces applied to the femoral head which exceed the strength of the capital physis. Pain and altered gait are the common presenting complaints of SCFE. Diagnosis can often be made by plain films alone. MRI may be used for diagnosis when clinical suspicion is high but there is no radiographic evidence. In fact, MRI is quickly becoming the modality of choice in these equivocal cases (2). Patients with a history of SCFE have a significantly increased risk of developing osteoarthritis especially if left untreated (3). The rate of development of osteoarthritis is related to the severity of the slip. Common radiographic findings of osteoarthritis include asymmetric joint space narrowing, osteophytes, periartcular sclerosis, and subarticular cysts.
