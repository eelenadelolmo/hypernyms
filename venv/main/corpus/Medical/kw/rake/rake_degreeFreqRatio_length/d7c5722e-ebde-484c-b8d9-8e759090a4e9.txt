No palpable abnormalities in the breast.  Two small skin moles, marked with metallic BB's.
No treatment or followup neccessary.
Bilateral screen film CC and MLO views of the breast were performed.  Metallic BB markers were placed over the nipples and two small skin lesions on each breast.  No palpable abnormality is present. Within the 6 O'clock position of the left breast in the retroglandular fat, is an area of fat and glandular tissue separate from the normal breast parenchyma.  Patient was called back for spot compression and magnification views of the left breast lower half.  These extra views show to better advantage the separate glandular tissue and fat that is surrounded by a pseudocapsule.  This pseudocapsule is best appreciated on the spot magnification view. The above findings are consistent with a hamartoma of the breast.
