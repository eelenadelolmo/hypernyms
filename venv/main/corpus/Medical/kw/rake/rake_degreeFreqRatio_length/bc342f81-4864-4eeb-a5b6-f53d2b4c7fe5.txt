Chest Radiography: Biapical air space opacities are noted with stranding toward the hila.  No pleural effusions or adenopathy is evident.

Contrast Enhanced CT: Both patchy and confluent air space opacities are evident in a central bilateral upper lobe distribution, with sparing of the lower lung zones.  No significant adenopathy is noted.

39 year old male who is HIV positive, with a CD4 count of 71 cells/mm3, and complaint of dyspnea on exertion.
This case demonstrates atypical radiographic findings of PCP, as the salient abnormalities are air space opacities occurring in a predominately upper lobe distribution.  These findings are in stark contrast to the symmetric perihilar and bilateral lower lobe reticular opacities frequently identified in PCP.
