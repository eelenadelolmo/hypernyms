Tenderness to palpation over the left lower lateral chest wall.  A single cutaneous laceration was noted in the left lower lateral chest wall.
She underwent diaphragmatic repair; the diaphragmatic tear was felt to have been caused by a puncture of the displaced rib fracture into the diaphragm; no foreign bodies were found.
Chest radiographs demonstrate left subpulmonic effusion with partial LLL atelectasis.  Chest CT images demonstrate a left diaphragmatic laceration with abdominal fat herniating into the left pleural space and a displaced left rib fracture.  A left pleural effusion is noted.
