Enlarged and exquisitely painful left hemiscrotum
Heterogeneous appearance of the left testicle on the initial image.  A mass cannot be excluded, though this appearance can arise in subacute to chronic torsion.

In the second image, no blood flow is seen.  This must be compared with the contralateral testicle to assess relative flow.

Histologically, there is significant hemorrhage surrounding the seminiferous tubules, with regions of necrotic tubules.  This testicle was blue and non-salvageable in the OR.  The hemorrhage contributes to the heterogeneous appearance on ultrasound
Testicular Torsion
Testicular torsion, sub-acute with or without underlying mass lesion.

Testicular hemorrhage/hematoma due to trauma
Sudden onset of testicular pain approximately 12 hours prior to ultrasound evaluation, no significant past medical history, no trauma
