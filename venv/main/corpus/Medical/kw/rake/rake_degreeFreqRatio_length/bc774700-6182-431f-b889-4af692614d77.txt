3 year old with macrocephaly and lower extremity stiffness.
Sagital T1 image shows cerebellar tonsilar ectopia with tonsils extending 6mm into a "tight" foramen magnum.  There is impingement of the spinal cord between the tonsils and the posterior aspect of C1 without signal alteration of the cord itself.

Axial images show enlargement of the lateral ventricles without evidence of transependymal CSF flow.  The third ventricle is also somewhat enlarged while the aqueduct and 4th ventricle are normal in size.  A normal CSF flow void is appreciated in the cerebral aqueduct.

3 year old with macrocephaly and lower extremity stiffness.
Ventriculomegaly is likely due to disruption of normal CSF flow through the foramen of Magendie and around the lower brainstem due to impingement by the "tight" foramen magnum.
