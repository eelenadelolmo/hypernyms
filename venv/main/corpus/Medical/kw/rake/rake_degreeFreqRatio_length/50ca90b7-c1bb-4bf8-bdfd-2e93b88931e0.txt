Bradycardia.
Supportive
CSF filled supratentorial cranium with minimal tissue anteriorly and posteriorly along the falx and also residual bilateral thalami.
The posterior fossa structures remain unremarkable with normal sized fourth ventricle and small but present quadrigeminal plate cistern.  The previously seen right-sided shunt catheter is now with tip superiorly and posteriorly in the CSF on the right side of the falx. There is no intracranial bleeding.
Cephalic disorders, Hydranencephaly
Hydranencephaly
Severe hydrocephalus
Alobar holoprosencephaly
2-year-old female with suspected shunt failure and
bradycardia.
Careful assessment for presence of peripheral brain parenchyma will help distinguish hydranenchyaphaly, which lacks peripheral parenchyma, from severe hydrocephalus, which has compressed peripheral brain parenchyma. Presence of a falx excludes the diagnosis of alobar holoprosencephaly, which is also associated with large fluid structures in the supratentorial cranium.
