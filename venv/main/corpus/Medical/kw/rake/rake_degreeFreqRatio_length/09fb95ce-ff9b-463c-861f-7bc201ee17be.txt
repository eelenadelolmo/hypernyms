Blastomyces Dermatitidis Ag 2.66 (2.1 – 4 considered positive)
Treatment usually includes amphotericin B or one of the azole drugs, which is normally itraconazole.  Some factors influencing treatment include 1) the clinical form and severity of the disease and 2) the immune status of the patient.  If the infection is severe, in the CNS, or systemic, a lipid formulation of amphotericin B is preferred.  If the disease state is mild or moderate and excludes the CNS, then itraconazole is the drug of choice.

If the patient is immunocompetent and presents with an acute infection, they may not require treatment at all.  If there is any possibility of an immunocompromised state, then amphotericin B should be promptly administered.
• Chest PA/lateral - normal

• CT Chest w/o contrast -  Cavitary left lower lobe nodule with evidence of endobronchial spread.
Pulmonary Blastomycosis
Acute pulmonary blastomycosis may be initially diagnosed as community-acquired pneumonia. 
Chronic blastomycosis is often misdiagnosed as tuberculosis or malignancy. 
Sarcoidosis and primary pulmonary lymphoma are possibilities.  
Any skin lesions may be mistaken for pyoderma gangrenosum or keratoacanthoma.
