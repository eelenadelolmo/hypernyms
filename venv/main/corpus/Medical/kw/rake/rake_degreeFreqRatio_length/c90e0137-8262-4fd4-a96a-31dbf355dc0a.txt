Premature infant with UVC, ET tube, and NG/OG tube.Area of pneumatosis in the stomach wall.  Dilated loops of bowel in RLQ.  Otherwise abdomen normal.
Gastric pneumatosis, etiology uncertain
1. Necrotizing enterocolitis
2. Gastric outlet obstruction 
   a. Duodenal atresia
   b. Malrotation with volvulus
3. Iatrogenic gastric mucosal injury
4. Emphysematous gastroenteritis - gas-forming organism
24+6 week infant at day of life 8 for a corrected age of 26 weeks.  Pt premature secondary to incompetent cervix with failure of cerclage. Pt with a history of umbilical artery and umbilical venous lines after birth, history of hyperkalemia, leukemoid reaction, and respiratory distress.  Pt with birth trauma and bruising to left lower extremity.  Pt with ng tube, UVC, and ET tube.  Pt on day 3 of enteral feeds with new residual after morning ng feed.  The residual was dark red in color with the consistency of digested formula.  Pt was made NPO after residual.  Pt without other signs of infection or changes in vent settings.
Isolated gastric pneumatosis is a very rare entity, and is most commonly seen with gastric or duodenal obstruction.  The more typical presentation of gastric pneumatosis is in association with more extensive pneumatosis intestinalis involving small and/or large bowel in patients with necrotizing enterocolitis.  However, this patient did not have additional areas of involvement.
