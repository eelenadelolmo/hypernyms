Texto: 
Mammography: Multiple folds and decrease size of the breast implant consistent with collapse.  

Breast MRI: Shows linear low signal intensities - "linguini sign" - within the breast implant.  There is also posterior extension of the saline superiorly and inferiorly consistent with extracapsular rupture.
Breast Implant Rupture
Implant rupture, intracapsular versus extracapsular
67 y.o. woman with history of left breast cancer.  She was treated with lumpectomy and radiation.  She had reconstruction with bilateral saline implants.
Saline implants have mostly replaced silicone gel implants at this time.  Many breast cancer patients will have implants and complications of implants are common.  Implants are typically walled off by a fibrous capsule.  Implant rupture and capsular contracture are common complications.  Capsular contracture is detected by physical exam where the implant becomes hard and immobile.   Intracapsular rupture occur when the capsule of the implant is rupture but contained by the fibrous capsule.  They are not usually seen by mammograms.  On MRI the ‚ÄúLinguini‚Äù sign can be seen and appears as linear low signal within the implant.  This is presumably implant shell floating in the implant.  Extracapsular rupture occurs when both the fibrous capsule and the implant is ruptured.    Occasionally, the implant material can extend into the axilla.
