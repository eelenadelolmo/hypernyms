Ovarian Vein Thrombosis
N/a
38 year old asian female with a long standing history of refractory hypertension and prior history of pancreatitis presents with right upper quadrant pain into the emergency medical department.

Right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrated a retroperitoneal mass in the region of the pancreatic head with extension into the porta hepatis.  Provision diagnosis of malignancy, undergoing workup.
Ovarian vein thrombosis is cited as a rare finding in post partum women and incidentally in patients with extensive pelvic surgery.  Complications include "perivenous phlegmon formation with hydronephrosis, sepsis, septic pulmonary thromboembolism, caval thrombosis, and death."

This patient presented with a presumptive malignancy involving pancreas.  Secondary to the hypercoagulability in malignancy, this is the probably etiology of this disease.
