Texto: 
On urine sample for evaluation of microalbumin and microscopic hematuria were noted (mild blood, 3 RBCs).  One month later, repeat urinalysis also had small amt. blood and 2 RBCs.  Additional tests were ordered.
CT urography showed no evidence of mass when bladder was opacified with IV contrast.  No evidence of echogenic cysts or fistulas on US.  Urine cell cytology showed no evidence of malignancy.

As a developmental variant, no treatment is required at this time.
â€¢ CT urography shows an anterior extension of the bladder lumen, without evidence of mass. 
â€¢ This "diverticulum" extends from the anterior bladder dome to a small, fat containing, umbilical hernia.
Vesico-urachal diverticulum
â€¢ fistulous tract from the bladder
â€¢ bladder diverticulum
â€¢ ulcerating bladder neoplasm
â€¢ persistent urachal duct or diverticulum
34 year old man seen by his primary care physician for management of newly diagnosed hypertension and diabetes.  No family or personal history of urinary neoplasms.  No urinary or abdominal symptoms.
Because of the persistent abnormal urinalysis, CT urography was obtained - showing the persistent urachal diverticulum, extending from the anterior bladder to the abdominal wall.
