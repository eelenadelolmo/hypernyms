• Adequately aligned spine. Diffuse joint tenderness; no joint erythema. Normal muscular development. Normal gait.
• Range of Motion:
» Limited cervical extension (67% of normal), R and L lateral cervical bending (45% and 64% of normal) [1].
» Cervical flexion, extension, rotation elicits pain in the back of the neck that radiates to shoulder.
» Limited lumbar flexion (85% of normal) and extension (60% of normal) [1].
» Limited lumbar R and L lateral bending (68% and 84% of normal) [1].
» Lumbar flexion elicits pain in low back, both buttocks and thighs down to knees.

• Jamar grip dynamometer: R 60lbs; L 55lbs; R-handed.
• Cranial Nerves: II-XII intact. 
• Deep Tendon Reflexes: +2 at brachioradialis, biceps, triceps, patellar, and Achilles bilaterally.

The patient continues to receive thorough chiropractic care to the cervical and lumbar spine, and upper and lower extremities for symptomatic relief of his arthralgia. The patient was instructed to take over-the-counter doses of acetaminophen as needed to alleviate diffuse pain, as well as lifestyle modifications involving improved diet and exercise.  Further evaluation is needed, with possible administration of tri-cyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline or cyclobenzaprine), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (duloxetine or milnacipran), or gabapentinoids (pregabalin, gabapentin)  if a diagnosis of fibromyalgia is confirmed [1].

Unenhanced multiplanar 3-T MRI imaging of the lumbar spine from T11-12 to L5-S1:
• The conus terminates at the level of the T12-L1 disc space, and within limits of the study. No distal cord abnormality is seen.
• At T11-12, T12-L1, L1-L2, L2-L3, and L3-L4, the canal and the neural foramina are patent. There is no annular bulge. The discs are well hydrated.
• At L4-5, there is a shallow annular bulge and mild facet arthropathy. Overall, the canal and the neural foramina still maintain their caliber.
• At L5-S1, the canal tapers in diameter due to increased deposition of epidural fat. The disc remains well hydrated and the neural foramina are patent.

Patient Photos:
• Diffuse macules and patches chest, abdomen, and thighs with sloughing and epidermal loss – characteristic of Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
Post Stevens-Johnson syndrome, resembling fibromyalgia
• Fibromyalgia
• Recurrent arthralgia secondary to Stevens-Johnson syndrome
• Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS)
• Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)
• Cervical and lumbar disc herniations
This is a 22 woman who was referred for further diagnosis of her worsening pain in her neck and low back. She first noticed the pain after recovering from Stevens-Johnson Syndrome in about 14 months ago, following the use of Bactrim for mastitis. She states that her neck and low back pain is constant, and is described it as a nagging ache with a deep stabbing sensation when aggravated.  Her neck pain is aggravated by movement and physical activity (e.g. cradling her baby), and radiates to her shoulders. Her low back pain is also aggravated by movement and physical activity, and radiates to her buttocks and thighs bilaterally. She also states that her arms and legs feel weaker, especially on the left side. She denies any associated fevers, headaches, or loss of function of any muscles/extremities. She has tried using NSAIDs, specifically aspirin and ibuprofen, but they have provided little relief. Patient rates her current discomfort at a 5/10, but rates her maximum pain when aggravated at an 8/10. She does not recall ever having a similar episode of neck and low back pain in the past.

Her past medical history is significant for Stevens-Johnson Syndrome with dermatological and ophthalmic sequelae.  Patient is not on any medications, is allergic to Bactrim, and denies alcohol, tobacco, or illicit/IV drug use.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread pain and increased sensitivity to pressure [1]. Prominent concomitant symptoms include chronic fatigue, cold extremities, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbances, anxiety and/or depression, gait instability, and muscle twitching [2]. Diagnosis is made according to the American College of Rheumatology guidelines, which requires that three conditions are met [3]: 

1. A widespread pain index (WPI) > 7 and symptom severity (SS) scale score > 5 OR WPI 3-6 and SS > 9.
2. Persistent symptoms for at least 3 months. 
3. No other disorder that would otherwise explain the pain.

WPI is scored on a 0-19 scale, with one point assigned if the patient has experienced pain over the last week in various locations: R/L shoulder girdle; R/L upper arm; R/L lower arm; R/L hip; R/L upper leg; R/L lower leg; R/L jaw; chest; abdomen; upper back; lower back; and neck. Symptom severity score asks the patient to rate level of fatigue, waking unfreshed, and cognitive symptoms each from 0 (no problem) to 3 (severe problem).  

The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, however studies postulate that a stressor triggering abnormal central nervous system pain processing – central sensitization – is to blame [4]. Psychological stressors – death of a loved one, prolonged hospitalization, trauma or MVA[5]  – and biological stressors – infections (Lyme disease, EBV, parvovirus, Q fever), acute GI  infections (Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella), status-post surgery or prolonged illness – are all associated with an increased risk of developing fibromyalgia [1]. Further studies have also noted an aggregation of fibromyalgia in patient families and specific polymorphisms in serotoninergic, dopaminergic, and catecholaminergic systems, suggesting a polygenic mode of inheritance [6].

With regards to our LG, WPI was scored at 18 out of 19, with pain experienced everywhere but the jaw. SS scale score was also greater than 5, with LG complaining of all three symptoms. Furthermore, in relation to the 1990 American College of Rheumatology guidelines for fibromyalgia diagnosis, pain upon palpation was elicited at 17 out of the 18 tenderness points, excluding the anterior aspects of inter-transverse spaces between C5 and C7 [2]. Given these findings through the history of present illness, review of symptoms, and physical exam, paired with a negative MRI of the lumbar spine, we concluded that the condition affecting LG most closely correlated with fibromyalgia, likely secondary to her recent episode of Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
