Transient oxygen desaturation.  Elevated heart rate.
Apparent thoracic aortic dissection.  Selected axial CECT images at the level of the ascending thoracic aorta as well as multiplanar reconstructed images show an apparent intimal/dissection flap extending from the aortic root to the aortic arch in a contiguous fashion.  The observation that the finding persisted on multiple contiguous images as well as the relative lack of findings to strongly suggest motion artifact led to concern on the part of radiologists and the patient’s ICU providers that acute thoracic aortic dissection was possible.  Due to the patient’s confounding clinical presentation (i.e., lack of clinical findings consistent with acute dissection), a repeat CECT examination was performed, this time with a dedicated thoracic aortic dissection protocol.  This CT showed no evidence of dissection.

Incidentally, note is made that no PE was seen on the original examination.
Motion artifact simulating acute thoracic aortic dissection
1.  Motion artifact, likely arising from the pulmonary artery outflow tract, resulting in the appearance of a dissection flap of the ascending thoracic aorta extending from the aortic root to the top of the aortic arch
2.  Ascending thoracic aortic dissection (shown not to be the case on follow-up imaging studies with more optimal timing of the administration of contrast material (CECT, aortic dissection protocol as opposed to CECT PE/DVT protocol).
64 year-old female with nonspecific, acute cardiopulmonary decompensation in the intensive care unit.  Primary service orders computed tomography to exclude pulmonary embolism.
There are several clues that the appearance of dissection may be do to motion artifact.  On the axial images, the main pulmonary artery appears wider than the aorta despite the fact that the calibers of the right and left pulmonary arteries are normal.  On the second axial image, the anterior superior recess of the pericardium projects over the pulmonary artery like a "double exposure" due to motion.  On the coronal oblique image, the apparent contour of the dissection flap matches that of the right ventricular outflow tract.  On the sagittal image, the infundibulum is not visualized despite the presence of the ascending and transverse aorta on the film.
