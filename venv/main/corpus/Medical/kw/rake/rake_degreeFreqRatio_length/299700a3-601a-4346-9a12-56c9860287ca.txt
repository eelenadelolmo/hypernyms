Mechanical dilitation
Film represents the esophagogram, performed with barium contrast as part of this patient's upper G.I. series. The film is remarkable for the abrupt narrowing in the distal third of the esophagus, consistant with a ring. This study demonstrates adequate distention of the distal esophagus which may be required to notice the finding in some individuals. Look at the film, and measure the width of the narrowed portion, and read on about the clinical significance of the measurement.

51yo Caucasian obese man presents with a three year history of intermittant epigastric tightness, usually occurring during meals or immediately postprandial.
Schatzki's ring of the esophagus is thought to be an exaggeration of an otherwise normal transvere mucosal fold, resulting in a narrowed passageway. The etiology is unkown. Although many clinicians frequently "call" this finding on radiographs, at least one source* claims this is a rare condition and should be differentiated from annular peptic stricture, the ring of Barrett's esophagus, or post-surgical fibrosis. A Schatzki's ring consists histologically of squamous epithelium above the ring and columnar below, but unlike Barrett's or other muscular rings, it is fixed and will not relax with the administration of amyl nitrate or anticholinergic agents. Schatzki's ring involves the lamina propria only, and there is no evidence of significant inflammation or fibrosis.
     Patients, if symptomatic, can complain of the classic "steakhouse syndrome," or occasional attacks of abrupt dysphasia while eating large bites of poorly chewed food, such as steak. Complaints can include substernal or even epigastric pain, as in this patient, and the sensation can be reportedly "fixed" by the intake of fluids or with regurgitation. The amount of narrowing naturally correlates to the risk of symptoms; rings less than twelve mm in diameter are likely to produce symptoms vs. rings greater than 21mm, as seen here, which are not usually found to be bothersome to the patient. Both sources list an associated finding of a hiatal hernia, as in this patient, which is discussed briefly below. Treatment for symptomatic rings
includes mechanical dilitation; however it is important to differentiate this from an annular peptic stricture, which is associated with esphagitis and makes the risk of esophageal rupture more likely during dilitation. Endoscopy can also make the distinction. Other elements of the differential include drug ingestion, such as doxycycline, quinidine, ascorbic acid, caustic ingestion, and also neoplasm (although generally would result in a longer area of narrowing).
     Most hiatal hernias are of the "sliding" variety, in which the defect in the esophageal hiatus allows a portion of the cardiac stomach to protrude into the thorax. This is thought to occur as a result of an age-related decrease in the firmness of the phrenic-esophageal membrane, which attaches the esophagus to the diaphragm. Radiologic proof of this abnormality includes demonstration of the hernia on a barium swallow exam, plus on e of the following: protrusion of greater than 2 cm pouch of stomach through the hiatus, presence of 3 or more gastric folds across the hiatus, a wide (over 3 cm) hiatus, or demonstration of a "polyp and fold complex" consisting of a single gastric fundal fold crossing the hiatus and leaving a pedunculated appearance.
     The supine LOA position is best for demonstrating a slinding hiatal hernia, with abdominal compression to increase or bring out the finding. Other types of hernias include a shortened, or "bradyesophagus," which can occur congenitally or secondary to Barrett's, or a paraesophageal hernia, in which the fundus protrudes through a separate opening in the diaphragm. Small sliding hernias typically are without clinical significance, and usually reduce in the standing/sitting position. However, if large, problems such as lesser curvature ulcers can arise from continued friction of the stomach through the hiatus.
