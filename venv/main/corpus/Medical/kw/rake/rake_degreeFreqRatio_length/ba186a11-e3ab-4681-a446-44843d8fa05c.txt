4/5 Strength of Right Upper Extremity – Grip Strength 25 pounds, Pinch Strength 5 pounds.
5/5 Strength of Left Upper Extremity – Grip Strength 50 pounds, Pinch Strength 12 pounds.
Positive Tinel’s Sign at the Right elbow; 8 PSI over cubital tunnel produced tingling of 4th/5th digits
Positive Spurling’s test at right upper extremity with pain localized to arm and elbow
Atrophy of right thenar muscles, most notably adductor pollicis

Cervical Spine ROM
Flexion to 25 degrees and extension limited to 4 degrees due to shoulder/neck discomfort
Right rotation limited to 30 degrees – limited by pain in R Shoulder; Left side rotation to 50 degrees

Neurological: Deep-Tendon Reflex +2 Bilaterally at Biceps, Triceps and Patellar; Sensation intact
To further evaluate cubital tunnel syndrome, electrodiagnostic studies were obtained. There was abnormal conduction velocity of right ulnar nerve motor fibers with evidence of conduction block above elbow stimulation site. Abnormal needle EMG of right upper limb showing increased insertional activity was also noted. 
This was interpreted by electromyographer as right ulnar neuropathy with axonal loss affecting motor fibers across the region of the right elbow. In addition, there was no electrophysiological evidence of cervical radiculopathy, brachial plexopathy, peripheral polyneuropathy or myopathy. This not inconsistent with the diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy as these studies are not sensitive.

This patient was followed by her chiropractor and additionally referred for surgical evaluation. Many of her diagnoses could be conservatively managed with possible improvements over time and the possibility of adequate symptom relief with chiropractic adjustments and medical therapy. However the potential for improved outcome of her cubital tunnel syndrome with surgical intervention was deemed to warrant consultation.

Cervical radiculopathy, Lumbar radiculopathy, Cubital tunnel syndrome, Right SLAP tear (grade 1), post-concussive syndrome, cervicalgia, acute lumbago
This patient’s complaints all began after her motor vehicle collision suggesting a high likelihood of traumatic etiology.

This patient’s complaints of right upper extremity pain, which was intermittently worsened and associated with tingling is suspicious for multiple possible diagnoses including cubital tunnel syndrome and cervical radiculopathy. The intermittent nature of distal neurological findings which are reproduced by applying pressure to the cubital tunnel region (Tinel’s sign at elbow) is suggestive of a diagnosis of cubital tunnel syndrome. 

Interestingly this patient also had complaints of upper extremity pain localized to the arm proximal to the elbow and occurring independently of the intermittent pain in the distal upper right extremity. Pain in this location has a low likelihood of being caused by cubital tunnel syndrome and the presence of a positive Spurling’s test suggests a diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy in addition to cubital tunnel syndrome. Cervical MRI provided additional evidence for this diagnosis with the finding of bilateral foraminal stenosis and encroachment of the osteophyte disk complex on the spinal cord at the level of C5-6. 

Headache, dizziness and neurovegetative symptoms of insomnia, forgetfulness, low energy, poor mood, and decreased appetite are consistent with post-concussive syndrome. Alternative or exacerbating etiology includes psychogenic origin secondary to stress from recent accident and injuries.
The patient is a 52 year old female with a recent history of motor vehicle collision. She was the front seat passenger of a vehicle which traveled off the road and collided with a telephone pole. She reports no air-bag deployment and was wearing her seat belt during the incident. She recalls her head colliding with the front windshield as well as her left arm, but does not know if any other body parts collided with anything during the accident. She reports brief loss of consciousness and no blood loss. Following the collision the vehicle was not drivable but she was able to walk back to her home without incident and sought no emergency care.

Since the collision, she has complaints of neck pain localized between her shoulder blades, lower back pain, pain in both lower extremities, and right upper extremity pain, weakness, and tingling. Movement of the right arm increases her pain, and the pain is minimized with returning the extremity to a resting position. The medial right forearm and 4th and 5th digits have intermittent tingling, weakness and pain which is worse with elbow flexion.

Since the accident she has also had new onset headaches, insomnia and tinnitus. The headaches are experienced in the temples bilaterally which are reported as severe in nature. These headaches are associated with photophobia, phonophobia and nausea. The headaches are aggravated by reading and relieved by resting and sleep. She also complains of forgetfulness, low energy, decreased mood, poor mood, and dizziness since the accident. She has had no incontinence, chest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain.

Past Medical History
She reports no prior medical conditions, no prior surgeries and takes no medications. She has had no previous traumatic events or injury.

 Atrophy of the palmar thenar muscles in this patient is evidence of significant impingement of the ulnar nerve, in her case likely at the cubital tunnel. Cubital tunnel syndrome is described as peripheral entrapment of the ulnar nerve as it travels in the region of the cubital tunnel under the humeroulnar arcade. Injury and disease at this location produces intermittent numbness, tingling, and pain distal to the entrapment commonly along the medial hand and 4th and 5th digits (1). The more broad terms ulnar neuropathy at the elbow and ulnar nerve entrapment refer to similar presentations where the lesion has not been specifically localized to the region of the cubital tunnel (3, 2).  Cubital tunnel syndrome most commonly presents after acute trauma causing nerve compression, sustained traction or friction. Additionally, joint pathology including osteophytes, arthritis synovitis, anomalous muscles or fibrous bands, ganglia or other mass lesions may produce ulnar nerve entrapment (1).

 Prognosis of cubital tunnel syndrome varies based on symptoms and severity at presentation. Patients with intermittent sensory symptoms and electrodiagnostic features only showing conduction slowing across the elbow often improve with conservative measures or remain stable over years.  Patients presenting acutely with persistent sensory loss and weakness without muscle atrophy often improve over three to six months. Some suggest that those who fail to show improvement after six months should be considered for surgical intervention (1). Potential surgical interventions include ulnar nerve decompression or transposition, the choice of which depends mainly on the experience and preference of the surgeon. There is limited research showing the natural progress of significant cubital tunnel impingements such as in this patient’s case or the outcomes of surgical treatment. It is possible that earlier surgical intervention in the presence of significant impairment may improve long term outcome. In patients assessed to have less severe symptoms or onset lasting less than six months conservative therapy including splinting, pads, activity modification, avoidance of provoking factors and nerve gliding exercises are recommended (1).

Cervical radiculopathy refers to nerve root damage in the spine at the cervical level that causes pain, numbness, tingling and weakness along a dermatome distribution (4). Cervical radiculopathy can be subclassified based on etiology including compressive cervical radiculopathy in which nerve roots are directly impacted by pathological processes or chemical cervical radiculopathy in which nerve roots are impacted secondary to inflammatory changes without direct impaction of nerve roots (3). Factors associated with increased risk of cervical radiculopathy include heavy manual laboring, smoking, driving or operating vibrating equipment. Less frequently cervical radiculopathy can be caused secondary to the presence of a tumor of the spine, an expanding cervical synovial cyst, giant cell arteritis and spinal infections (4).

Cervical spondylosis and disk herniation are the two most common pathological processes causing cervical radiculopathy. More rare etiologies include infectious processes like herpes zoster or lyme disease, nerve root infarction, root avulsion, tumor infiltration, or demyelination. Disc herniation causes cervical radiculopathy when the nucleus pulposus prolapses through the annulus and directly presses on a nerve root or causes inflammation affecting the nerve root (3). Spondylosis is the nonspecific condition resulting from deterioration of the spine. It has been proposed that spondylosis can cause cervical radiculopathy when musculoskeletal stress causes reactive osteophyte formation which impinges or compresses the cervical nerve roots (3). Because the foramina progressively decrease in size from C2-C3 to C6-C7 the majority of cervical radiculopathy occur at the lower levels with an estimated 25% of cervical radiculopathies affecting the C6 nerve and 60% affecting C7 (4).

When treating cervical radiculopathy, non-surgical treatments includes exercise therapy, avoidance of provocative activities, cervical traction, using a cervical pillow for padding and the use of medications for symptomatic relief. This includes NSAIDs like ibuprofen or naproxen for pain relief; gabapentin, pregabalin or amitriptyline for neuropathic pain and in more severe cases corticosteroids (oral or injections) or opiates like oxycodone can be used. In the event of muscle spasm, muscle relaxants like cyclobenzaprine or methocarbamol can provide relief (4). The benefits of surgical intervention have not been clearly established, however a randomized clinical trial showed short term improvement in pain, muscle strength and sensory loss at 4 months after surgery but at 12 months of follow-up no significant differences in pain or sensory disturbances were found between the surgical and non-surgically treated groups (5).
