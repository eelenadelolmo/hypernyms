Thyroid gland- Non-tender, estimated to be approximately 25-30 grams in size.  The contour of the thyroid is irregular.  No discrete nodules are palpable.  No cervical lymphadenopathy is appreciated.TSH- <0.08 (REF 0.49-4.67)FT4- 1.30 (REF 0.71-1.85)
Treatment options: I-131 ablation, thioamides (methimazole or propylthiouracil, B-blockers like propanolol, surgery (thyroidectomy), or close clinical follow-up without medical or surgical interventionFollow-up: NM uptake scans can be performed after a series of hyperthyroid treatment as above to assess effectiveness of treatment.  If concern is for cold nodules, FNA can be performed to rule out malignancy.
I-123 24-hour thyroid uptake scan was performed.  The thyroid gland appears symmetrical, in usual shape and location.  There are four foci of increased radiotracer concentration within the gland; one at the level of the isthmus on the right, one small focus at the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the right lobe, one in the upper left lobe and one in the mid-lower half of the left lobe.  There are no photopenic areas identified.  The thyroid-to-background ratio appears normal to increased.Radioiodine uptake: 4 hours- 6% (REF 2-12%); 24 hours- 16% (REF 12-30%)

48 yo woman followed in the internal medicine clinic for abnormal thyroid function tests, she is clinically euthyroid.
