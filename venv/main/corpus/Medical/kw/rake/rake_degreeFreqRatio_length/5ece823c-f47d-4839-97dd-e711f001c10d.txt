Surgical excision of the esophageal mass.  Patient did recieve a post operative up barium swallow to rule out any tears within the mucosa folowing resection.  Studies reveled an intact esophageal mucosa with no leakage of contrast.No further follow up required.
Sagittal CT images through the chest with IV contrast.  Imageing shows an esophageal mass approximately 2.2 x 1.9 cm located at the gastroesophageal junction.
Esophageal leiomyoma
esophageal cancer, esophageal diverticula,esophageal lymphoma
Patient is a 20 year old active duty female with chest wall deformity.  Patient was sent for pre-operative CT. Patient without any complaints.
This patientâ€™s leiomyoma was asymptomatic with no complaints of dysphagia, regurgitation, esophageal obstruction or chest pain.  Her leiomyoma was an incidental finding and following surgical resection without complications no other follow up is needed because no incidence of reoccurrence has ever been reported.
