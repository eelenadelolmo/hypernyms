Unremarkable physical exam.  Specifically, there is no TTP over the superiolateral patella.
No labs drawn.
None required.
The visualized osseous structures display normal mineralization
and alignment, without fracture, subluxation, dislocation, or significant
degenerative changes.  Incidental note is made of a bipartite patella with a clearly visualized lucency separating the superolateral aspect from the remainder of the patella.  The soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
Bipartite Patella
Bipartite Patella
Patellar Fracture
Stress Fracture
Osteochondral Fragment
Patient is a 23-year-old male with pain in the subpatellar area over the past few days.
This patient's bipartite patella is a type III superolateral bipartite patella, which can become symptomatic from repetitive trauma and require intervention.  If the vastus lateralis is partially detached from the bipartite fragment, symptoms may be relieved. Absence of TTP in the current case makes this scenario unlikely.
