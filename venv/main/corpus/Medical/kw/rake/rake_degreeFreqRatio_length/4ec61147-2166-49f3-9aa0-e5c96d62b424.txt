Chronic Interstitial Lung Disease secondary to SLE
The patient is a 55yo African American female with a 30 year history of SLE manifested by proteinuria, Jaccoud's arthritis, h/o CNS vasculitis, discoid lesions, and chronic interstitial lung disease who presented with a non-productive cough, clear rhinorrhea, and an increase in her home oxygen requirement from 2LNC to 3LNC. Pt complained of shortness of breath without chest pain that progressed over three days prior to admission. Pt reported that she increased her use of her albuterol inhaler with minimal relief of her dyspnea. Pt denied any fevers, chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Pt was afebrile and her WBC was WNL. Pt was on prednisone chronically.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease with a peak incidence in females between the ages of 15 and 40. The female to male ratio is about 5:1. In the United States, SLE is more prevalent among blacks and Hispanics. SLE occurs with a much higher frequency among first degree relatives. Also, within extended families other autoimmune conditions such as hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, and thyroiditis may be found in addition to SLE. Although SLE demonstrates a hereditary influence, most cases of SLE are sporadic and idiopathic.

Pulmonary disease is a relatively common manifestation of SLE. However, the specific clinical manifestations of SLE involvement of the respiratory system are very diverse. These manifestations include acute lupus pneumonitis, chronic interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, and shrinking lung syndrome. Lupus pneumonitis can present as an acute illness or as a chronic process.

Acute lupus pneumonitis is uncommon. It presents with the same signs and symptoms as an infectious pneumonia; cough, fever, dyspnea, patchy alveolar infiltrates on chest .radiography, and occasionally hemoptysis with a drop in hematocrit. Often the acute lupus pulmonary disease is accompanied by other signs of SLE exacerbation. When there is a doubt as to the etiology of the pulmonary infiltrates, a bronchoalveolar lavage is indicated. The accepted first line treatment is glucocorticoids. When hemoptysis is present, it is thought to be the result of pulmonary hemorrhage due to pulmonary vasculitis. For the pulmonary hemorrhage syndromes of acute immune-mediated lung injury in SLE patients, pulse methylprednisone therapy may be effective. For critically ill patients, the addition of azathioprine or cyclophosphamide to the glucocorticoids is recommended. The reported overall mortality rate for acute lupus pneumonitis is over 50% despite treatment.

The chronic form of lupus pneumonitis can result as a consequence of previous insult to the lungs from acute pneumonitis or can be an independent manifestation of SLE. It is characterized by exertional dyspnea, non-productive cough, basilar rales, and radiographic findings consistent with interstitial lung disease. Often radiographic findings of interstitial lung disease may be noted prior to clinical symptoms being manifested. The major clinical question that must be addressed in chronic lupus pneumonitis is whether inflammatory alveolitis present. Inflammatory alveolitis can be treated with immunosuppression where as chronic fibrosis is not treatable. Discriminating between inflammatory alveolitis and chronic fibrosis can be difficult. A reticular pattern with honeycombing on high resolution CT is suggestive of irreversible fibrosis. A ground-glass appearance is indicative of active inflammation on high resolution CT.
