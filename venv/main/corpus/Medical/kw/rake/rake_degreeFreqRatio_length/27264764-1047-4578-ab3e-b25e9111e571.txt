Normal laboratory values and physical exam.
The patient will follow up with Urology and will repeat the Whitaker test in 2-3 weeks with consideration of repeat pyloplasty.
Multiple fluoroscopic images during the placement of a percutaneous nephrostomy tube and performance of a Whitaker Test.  The collecting system is dilated with no contrast seen to extend beyond the UPJ.  The bladder is emptied with a Foley Catheter.  Pressure measurements are discussed below.
UPJ obstruction.
The question asked in this case of known ureteropelvic juction obstruction is whether or not he is completely obstructed.  This question was answered utilizing the Whitaker Test.  The initial measurement of pressure differential between the renal pelvis and bladder was approximatley 17 cmH2O.  After infusion of contast at 10cc/min the measurement rose to 18 and at 20cc/min the pressure was 21 cmH2O.  All of these signify obstruction according to the Whitaker test.
Patient is a 36 year old male with a history of multiple obstructing renal stones who has undergone mulitiple lithotripsy procedures.  He has also undergone two endoscopic pyloplasties and stent placements.  He recently presented with pain and stones on the affected side.
The Whitaker Test was originally described in 1973 as a way of assessing for ureteropelvic junction obstruction.  The procedure is performed by emptying the bladder with a urinary catheter.  The renal collecting system is accessed percutaneously using standard aseptic technique.  A dual lumen nephrostomy tube or needle is inserted.  The nephrostomy tube is connected to a three way stopcock.  One channel of the stopcock is connected to a power injector, one to a pressure measuring device and one to the nephrostomy tube or the 22 gauge needle.  The initial measurement, with the bladder empty, is recorded. A measurement of less than 15 cm of water is considered normal.  The power injector is then set in infuse into the collecting system at 10cc/min.  Measurements at a flow rate of 20cc/min can also be recorded.
