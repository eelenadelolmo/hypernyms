Texto: 
A port-a-catheter reservoir is palpable in the region of the left anterior chest subjacent to a recently healed surgical incision.
The patient underwent successful flouroscopic guided endovascular snare retreival of the catheter embolus.

A new port-a-cath was eventually placed.
Foreign Body(catheter) in right ventricle, infundibulum, pulmonary trunk, right pulmonary artery, and segmental branch of the right pulmonary artery subserving the superior segment of the right lower lobe.
Foreign body embolization.
Device failure
Operator error
44 y/o female with one day history of sharp, substernal chest pain. One week prior to onset of chest pain, she underwent placement of Port-a-Cath via a left subclavian vein access for long term chemotherapy administration.

Her past medical history is significant for bilateral breast cancer.
Her past surgical history includes bilateral mastectomies.
Port-a-caths are longterm venous access devices most commonly used for the administration of chemotherapy, but which can also be used for TPN, and intermittent blood draws. The most common complications include infection, thrombosis, catheter occlusion, catheter embolization, and catheter deconnection.
