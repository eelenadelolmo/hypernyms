Texto: 
Pleasant woman of low normal intelligence demonstrates the facial stigmata of tuberous sclerosis, adenoma sebaceum.  She is had severe left flank tenderness upon physical examination.  Her hemoglobin value was 6.5
Superselective embolization with particles and coils.
A renal scan showed significant preservation of renal function.
The CT performed revealed a huge left retroperitoneal hematoma and fat containing tumor within the kidneys bilaterally.  A conventional angiogram confirmed the presence of multiple angiomyolipomas in the left kidney.
Angiomyolipoma with hemorrhage
The findings in this case are pathonmemonic but it is important to note that minor trauma could have been a contributing factor to the acute bleed.  Intellectually it is important to remember that renal cell cancer can engulf fat within the renal pelvis.  Therefore fat within a renal mass does not by itself exclude the possibility of cancer.
30 year old woman with a known history of tuberous sclerosis and seizures has an episode of unrelenting left flank pain and is noted to be hypotensive upon presentation to the emergency room
The patient had an ultrasound from a prior visit that demonstrated the large number of angiomyolipomas bilaterally.  A previous CT of the brain was available which demonstrated calcified subependymal nodules.
