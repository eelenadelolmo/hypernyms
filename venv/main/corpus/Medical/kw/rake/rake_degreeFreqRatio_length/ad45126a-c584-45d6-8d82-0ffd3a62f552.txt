The patient presented to the primary care physician with complaint of two weeks of left lower quadrant abdominal pain which was originally sharp and crampy.  The pain slowly resolved over two weeks duration.
The patient was found to have acute diverticulitis as the source of her acute left lower quadrant abdominal pain and fevers.  The cystadenoma was an incidental finding.  On further questioning the patient admitted to long history of urinary incontinence that was undoubtedly caused by the neoplasm.  Surical managment was uncomplicated.
