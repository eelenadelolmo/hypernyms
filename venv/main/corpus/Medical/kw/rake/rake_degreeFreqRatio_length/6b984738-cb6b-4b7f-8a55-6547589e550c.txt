Tenderness over distal fibula; lateral ankle ligamentous laxity was noted on physical exam.
The patient was seen by an orthopedic surgeon for the ankle pain.  During ankle surgery to reconstruct ankle ligaments, the calcaneal lesion was removed and the space was filled with bone cement.
Radiograph (fig 1) demonstrates a lucent lesion in the calcaneus.  No central calcification was originally noted.
The internal matrix of the lesion could be fluid or cellular tissue.
A follow-up radiograph (fig 2) was encountered 9 months
later.

Chondroblastoma is cartilage-containing lesion first described in the 1920s under different names, but appropriately named in the 1940s.

Chondroblastoma is an uncommon primary bone tumor
comprising less than 1%-3% of primary bone tumors from
two large series. It occurs most frequently in the
epiphyses (calcaneus is an "epiphyseal equivalent") and secondary ossification centers of long bones, with 70% occurring in the femur, humerus, and tibia in that order.
Approximately 10% of all chondroblastomas occur in the small bones of the hands and feet; the talus and calcaneus are the common sites.

About 90% of the tumors occur in those aged 5-25 years.

The typical radiographic appearance is of a lucent bone lesion with a narrow zone of transition.  Lesion size can range from 1-6cm.  Scalloping or expansion of cortical bone may be present. Fine calcifications, either punctate or in rings, may be visible. Cysts are present about 20% of the time, and both MRI and CT can define the fluid levels. 

Complications associated with chondroblastoma include pathologic fractures and, rarely, malignant transformation. Without surgical excision, the tumor may extend into the adjacent soft tissues or synovium and metastasize to distant organs. Metastasis, when they occurs, most frequently involves the lungs.
