Prolonged cranial traction (3 months) is only method that will reduce lateral mass displacement. Skeletal traction is necessary for a total of 3 months.
CORONAL CT CSPINE: Lateral translocation of right C1 articular pillar relative to C2.
AXIAL CT CSPINE: Breaks in the anterior and posterior ring of C1 with asymmetric right lateral mass displacement and disruption of the transverse atlantal ligaments.
CT HEAD: Diffuse cerebral edema with loss of gray-white matter differentiation, subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage.
