Unremarkable physical exam and labs.
This patient will be conservatively managed by follow-up imaging only.
Axial pre-contrast CT image demonstrates a large heterogeneous-appearing lesion in the deep white matter/basal ganglia of left frontal region. The lesion demonstrates high density resulting from calcification and/or small areas of hemorrhage. 

T2-weighted MRI demonstrates a hypointense blooming artifact within a lesion in the left frontal lobe.

Gradient-echo MRI demonstrates multiple, bilateral punctate and rounded areas of hypointensity within the periventricular and subcortical white matter.
Cerebral Cavernous Malformation (Angioma)
•Cerebral Cavernous Malformation
•Other occult vascular malformation (thrombosed AVM/aneurysm, capillary telangiectasia)
•Hemorrhagic primary or secondary neoplasm (metastatic melanoma, thyroid, renal cell, choriocarcinoma)
•Amyloid angiopathy
•Treated or prior infection (toxoplasmosis, cysticercosis)
•Multiple hemorrhages associated with blood dyscrasia (disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, leukemia)
34 year old man with history of intermittent headaches throughout the last 10 years. The last 4 episodes were associated with transient minimal non-specific neurological deficits.
