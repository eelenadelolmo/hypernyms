Blood pressure:  160/90.
AV graft in the left forearm â€“ no thrill is present
Right-sided surgical scars at the base of the neck and on the anterior chest wall from previous dialysis catheters
Elevated serum creatinine
Angioplasty and subsequent stent placement

Editor's note: most operators would not place a stent between the clavicle and the first rib because of the high risk of stent fragmentation due to repetative mechanical stress at this location (This same rational is what prohibits most operators from stenting across joints)  Angioplasty alone, followed by diligent monitoring of dialysis intrafistula velocities and flow rates during dialysis and repeat angioplasty when necessary, is the optimal therapy
Stenosis in the left subclavian vein at the level of the thoracic inlet
subclavian vein stenosis
Intimal hyperplasia due to arterialization of flow in the subclavian vein, leading to greater vessel caliber, followed by repetitive trauma from impingement between the first rib and clavicle.  This is a common reason for dimished flow through dialyis fistulae
47 year old female with end stage renal disease who is dialyzed through a left upper extremity arteriovenous graft.  The flow rates in the graft have become suboptimal.
Most operators would treat this lesion with angioplasty alone rather than with stenting.
