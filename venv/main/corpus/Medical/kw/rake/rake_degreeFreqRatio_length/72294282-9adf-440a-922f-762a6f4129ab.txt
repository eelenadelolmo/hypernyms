Texto: 
Scrotal enlargement with increased size of left testicle, soft mass anterior with firm, more normal density testicular tissue posteriorly.  Minimal discomfort with palpation.
There is a 9 cm anechoic cystic mass adjacent but external and superior to the left testicle with multiple free floating echogenic specks within the cyst fluid.  This is within the epididymal head on the left.  

Within the testicular parenchyma are multiple cystic foci in the region of the testicular mediastinum without soft tissue mass.  The findings are classic for tubular ectasia within the rete testis which may be associated with small adjacent intratesticular cysts

A small surrounding hydrocele is present
Small hydrocele, Epididymal head cyst and tubular ectasia of the Rete Testis
For the findings external to the testis:
Spermatocele / Epididymal head cyst
Hydrocele
Pyocele
Hematocele secondary to:
          Trauma
          Infection
          Neoplasm
Hernia

Within the Testis:
      Tubular ectasia of the rete testis
      cystic testicular neoplasm
45 yo male, active duty military with 1 month history of increased scrotal size and pain.  No history of significant trauma recalled, mild discomfort
