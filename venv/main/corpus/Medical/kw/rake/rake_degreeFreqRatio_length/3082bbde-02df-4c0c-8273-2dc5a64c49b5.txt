18-FDG PET images demonstrate decreased cerebral metabolism in the left hippocampus and the bilateral parietal lobes.  Coronal T2/Flair MR images demonstrate decreased signal and size of the left hippocampus, relative to the right.
Mesial Temporal Hypometabolism (sclerosis)
Multiple infarcts / ischemia
Alzheimer's dementia
Mesial temporal sclerosis
78 y.o. man with chronic seizure disorder and worsening memory loss.
This case demonstrates how 18-FDG PET can be used for assessment of cerebral metabolism, and corresponding functional deficits.  Mesial temporal sclerosis is a well-known cause of refractory seizures.  The hypometabolism in the parietal lobes has also been found in patients with Alzheimer's dementia, although often the posterior temporal lobes are involved as well.
