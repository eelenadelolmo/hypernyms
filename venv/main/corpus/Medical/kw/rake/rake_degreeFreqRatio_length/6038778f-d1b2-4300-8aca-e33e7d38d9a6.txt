Physical exam: Irritable with gait disturbance.
Bone marrow transplant.  Patient will be followed both clinically and with imaging to assess the progression of the disease.
CT:  Abnormal white matter low attenuation within the periventricular white matter, most pronounced in the region of the right centrum ovale.

MRI: Nonspecific prolonged T2 signal in the periventricular white matter adjacent to the patient's  right  greater than  left  occipital  horns. This is not associated with any focal enhancing mass.
Krabbe Disease
Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis: Battens disease, Taysachs Disease and other lipid storage syndromes Neurofibromatosis 1
Metachromic Leukodystrophy
The patient is a 2 year, 2 month old African American male who presents with gait disturbance, irritability and fever. Incidentally, the patient’s 4 year old sister presents concurrently with similar complaints. The patient has no significant medical or surgical history prior to this presentation.  Allergy to morphine: rash.  No history of known definite exposure to toxins.
Incidentally this patient’s sister presented at the same time with irritability and fever.  The sibling was found to have a  glioma within the left basal ganglia that was surgically resected.  The pathology returned as pilocytic astrocytoma.  While no connection between neoplasm and Krabbe was found through data/literature review, a link cannot be completely excluded.
