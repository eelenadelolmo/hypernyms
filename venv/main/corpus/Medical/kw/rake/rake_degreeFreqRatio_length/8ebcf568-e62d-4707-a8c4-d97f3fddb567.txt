Decreased lower extremity motor and sensory function.
Surgical clipping of fistula.
Chronic disk protrusion and posterior discogenic osteophytes at T5-6. 

Intramedullary focus of high signal intensity on both T1 and T2 sequences consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage. T2 hyperintensity within the spinal cord extending from approximately T5 to T9 
  
Multiple large serpentine flow voids within the thecal sac posterior to the spinal cord extending approximately from the level of T3 to T12.
Spine dural arteriovenous fistula
Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula
Spinal arteriovenous malformation
64 y.o. man with Hx of abnormal MRI from outside institution
A small focus of late acute hemorrhage is noted within the cord exhibiting the signal characteristics of extracellular methemoglobin.  This hemorrhagic event may have been why the patient sought treatment.

Chronic hemorrhage within the cord is more common with AVMs, which leads to low signal on Gradient echo sequences.  An acute hemorrhage may mask the presence of chronic hemosiderin on spin echo sequences.
