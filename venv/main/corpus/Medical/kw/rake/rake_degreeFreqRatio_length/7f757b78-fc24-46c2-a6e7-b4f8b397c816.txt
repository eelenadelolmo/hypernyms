Congenital bronchial atresia is felt to be the result of an in-utero vascular insult after the 15th week of gestation which results in focal obliteration of a lobar or segmental bronchial airway while the distal structures remain intact. Most commonly in the LUL, any lobe can be affected. Typically, mucous plugging affects the atretic and distal segment secondary to inadequate clearing past the focal occlusion. Collateral air filling through pores of Kohn and channels of Lambert results in a hyperlucent hyperinflated lobe distal to the atretic segment. The mucous impacted bronchus distal to the atresia appears as a tubular / ovoid opacity near the center of the hyperlucent lobe. Hyperinflation of the affected lobe may result in secondary findings such as diaphragmatic flattening, mediastinal shift, or displacement of normal fissures.
