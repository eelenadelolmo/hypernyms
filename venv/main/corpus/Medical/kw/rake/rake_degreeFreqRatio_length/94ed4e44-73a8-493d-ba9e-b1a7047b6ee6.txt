Preoperative labs within normal limits.
The patient is followed with periodic CXR's.
PA/LAT chest radiographs demonstrate a 3cm thick walled cavitary mass in the anterior aspect of the right lower lobe.  No air-fluid level is seen.

CT: Axial CT image of the chest in lung window demonstrated 3cm cavitary lesion in the anterior right lower lobe.  The wall has a thick, irregular nodular appearance.  There is associated surrounding bronchiectasis.

PET:  Increased F18-FDG uptake within the right lower lobe mass.
Squamous cell carcinoma
Cavitary lung tumor (squamous cell, sarcoma, metastasis)
Abscess
Cavitated granuloma
78 y/o male smoker with past medical history of head/neck cancer presented for preop PA/LAT CXR and CT prior to resection of enlarging lung mass.
This patient had a history of head and neck cancer and was found to have a Bosniac II renal cyst.  A CT of the chest done in 2004 showed a 1 cm RLL nodule.  On follow-up CT the mass had enlarged and cavitated.  A PET scan showed increased F18-FDG uptake.  Bronchoscopy was positive for SCC.
