On physical examination, patient had mild fever, a few oral ulcers, asymmetric arthritis of hands and feet with clinical inflammation and erythema.  Laboratory studies show HLA-B27 as positive.
Symptomatic treatment is high doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as indomethacin.  Intra-articular steroid injections may be helpful in patients w/ large joint effusions.
AP of the feet shows joint space narrowing and proliferative changes at first metatarsophalangeal joint (left greater than right) with subluxations at the metatarsophalangeal joints of both feet.
