Post operative scans reveal complete tumor removal.  No evidence of residual infundibulum.  Tumor completely replaced the pituitary stalk at surgery.  This is, obviously, a very unusual location and presentation for hemangioblastoma.   Most commonly, hemangioblastoma is a cerebellar lesion; and, is associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease in about 20% of cases.  More on hemangioblastoma:
