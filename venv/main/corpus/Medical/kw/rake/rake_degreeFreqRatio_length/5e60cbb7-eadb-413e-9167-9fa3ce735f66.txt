Texto: 
Pt. had no motor or sensory deficits. No gross osseous deformity was noted.
The patient has an MRI pending on his most symptomatic exostosis in the left proximal humerus to assess for fracture, measure the cartilagenous cap to exclude malignant transformation to a chondrosarcoma and assess for bursitis or mass effect on adjacent structures.
Plain films of the upper arms and knees demonstrated multiple exostoses. No acute fractures or abnormal soft tissue masses were identified.
MULTIPLE HEREDITARY EXOSTOSIS
Multiple Hereditary Exostoses, Post traumatic changes.
14 year old male with knee and upper arm pain after a football game.
This patient was asymptomatic from his exostosis and became symptomatic following contact sport activity. This is likely because of a fracture of the exostosis, mass effect on surrounding structures or bursitis (in the overlying bursa exostotica).
