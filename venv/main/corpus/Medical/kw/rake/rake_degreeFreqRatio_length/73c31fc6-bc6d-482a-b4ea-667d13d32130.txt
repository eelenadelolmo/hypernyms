Extra-abdominal loops of bowel were placed in a silo device and eventually surgically returned to the patient’s peritoneal cavity without complication of necrotizing enterocolitis.
Gastroschisis.  Frontal portable radiograph of the abdomen in this neonate shows an anterior abdominal wall defect just lateral to the level of the umbilical cord insertion.  To the left of the patient, herniated loops of small bowel are individually outlined by air.  The umbilicus was found to be normal in position.  Prominent tubular shaped opacity projecting in a superior to inferior manner over the mid-portion of the patient’s lower abdomen and pelvis represents a silo into which the loops of small bowel were eventually placed.
