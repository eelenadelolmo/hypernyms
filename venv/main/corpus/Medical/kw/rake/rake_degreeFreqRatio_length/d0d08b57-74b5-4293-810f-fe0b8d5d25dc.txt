If her primary care physician wanted to pursue the above he/she tap the joint space affected.  Identification of CPPD crystals would be diagnostic.  Light microscopy can further distinguish needle-shaped gout crystals from rhomboid-shaped crystals.  

Treatment for chondrocalcinosis is typically aimed at the primary disease.  Cochicine and NSAIDS are used most often.
