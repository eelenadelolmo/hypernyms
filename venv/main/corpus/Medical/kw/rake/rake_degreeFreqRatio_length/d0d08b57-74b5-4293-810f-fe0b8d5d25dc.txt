Calcium level   9.0    (8.4 - 10.2) nml

No other relavent laboratory data available.
This patient did not undergo treatment or follow up via labs or radiology.

If her primary care physician wanted to pursue the above he/she tap the joint space affected.  Identification of CPPD crystals would be diagnostic.  Light microscopy can further distinguish needle-shaped gout crystals from rhomboid-shaped crystals.  

Treatment for chondrocalcinosis is typically aimed at the primary disease.  Cochicine and NSAIDS are used most often.
