Treatment consists of anticoagulation and supportive care.
There is a large saddle embolus that extends into the bilateral proximal main pulmonary arteries. There is a small-to-moderate sized right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. 

IMPRESSION:                                                 
1. Saddle pulmonary embolus with involvement of the bilateral main pulmonary arteries.
Saddle pulmonary embolism
A 62 year old male status post recent CABG developed sudden onset chest pain, shortness of breath, hypotension, and hypoxia.
More than 600,000 cases of pulmonary embolism occur each year in the United States.  1/3 of these cases result in death.  Patients typically present with symptoms such as dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, anxiety, and cough.  Asymptomatic embolisation can also occur.  Physical examination often reveals tachypnea, rales, and a second heart sound.  These findings are obviously nonspecific.  
There are a number of different radiologic imaging modalities  used to diagnose pulmonary embolism.  The most common include chest radiograph, ventilation/perfusion lung scintigraphy, helical CT pulmonary angiography, and pulmonary angiography.  Methods of noninvasive imaging deep venous thrombosis include compression and Doppler ultrasound of the legs and magnetic resonance venography of the extremities and pelvis.
Dedicated CT angiography of the central pulmonary arteries using a helical acquisition technique, thin collimation, and rapid infusion of intravenous contrast are sensitive in the detection of segmental, lobar, and main pulmonary artery emboli.  Intraluminal filling defects or nonopacified vessels represent pulmonary emboli.  
Pulmonary angiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.  It can reliably detect pulmonary emboli at the segmental level.  Techniques such as balloon occlusion cineangiography and magnification angiography can detect emboli as small as 2 mm in diameter.
