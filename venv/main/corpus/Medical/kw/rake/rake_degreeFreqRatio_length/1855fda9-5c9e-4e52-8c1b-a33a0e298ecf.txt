Patient had elevated prolactin levels (22.5 ng/ml; normal 3-18.6), as well as a slightly elevated estradiol level (15 pg/ml). An LRF stimulation test with Leuprolide acetate (synthetic gonadotropin-releasing hormone) was ordered to rule out precocious puberty, and an MRI was ordered to rule out pituitary adenoma. A neurology/oncology clinic was consulted, and at the time the prolactin and estradiol levels had returned to normal. However, the alpha fetal protein levels were mildly elevated (11.5 ng/ml; normal 0-8.5 ng/ml).
Normal LRF stimulation labs ruled out precocious puberty. CSF studies ruled out a germ cell tumor for the intrasellar cyst.  No calcifications, which is common in craniopharyngioma, and the absence of a suprasellar lesion rule-out craniopharyngioma.  No treatment is needed if there is no adenoma.  An MRI every year is required to ensure no significant growth has occurred.
The first MRI showed a pituitary mass of 7.5 x 4.8 x 4.3 mm in height, transverse, and AP views, respectively. By age 6, the adenoma has grown to 8 x 12 x 6, but has remained stable since. Imaging shows no anterior or posterior flattening of the pituitary gland.
Intrasellar cyst with spurious hyperprolactinemia
• Pituitary microadenoma (intrasellar pituitary cyst)
• Rathke’s Cleft Cyst Remnant
• Precoccious puberty
• Craniopharyngioma
1 yr old girl presented with premature thelarche and hypertrichosis on legs during the 1st year wellness checkup.

The initial concern in this young child was hyper-prolactinemia from a suprasellar mass causing the "stalk effect".  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2668659/

However, the imaging did not show a suprasellar mass, and the prolactin elevation was minimal.  Prolactin levels due to the stalk effect are usually lower than produced by a prolactinoma. However, the values from the stalk effect will still be significantly higher than just the slightly elevated prolactin levels this patient showed (Anywhere from
100ng/ml to under 250ng/ml verses this patient's 23ng/ml). 

After discussing this case with a pediatric endocrinologist, his top theory was the stress caused to the patient. It could be due to the child&#39;s environment at home, or the fact the she
just had about 10 immunization shots (1 year check-ups are the worst).

Lastly, regarding the DDX. I was looking into distinguishing the cysts from the adenoma. One thought I had was that the growth of the cyst would be slower than the adenoma presented. 

Followup of the child, for early detection of any visual disturbance, will prevent loss of sight in the event that the lesion grows.
