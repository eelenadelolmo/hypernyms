HCG 1578 mIU/ml
Laprascopic surgery to remove the left fallopian tube.
A ovoid fluid collection with thick soft tissue wall and hypervascularity is seen in the left adnexa.  There is no evidence of a gestational sac within the uterus.  The finding is consistent with a tubal ring sign with an attempt at a "ring of fire"
Ectopic Pregnancy
Ectopic pregnancy
acute onset left lower quadrant pain
Left adnexal mass with no evidence of an IUP and a positive HCG in a range which should allow visualization of the gestational sac is highly concerning for an ectopic pregnancy.  The appearance here of a tubal pregnancy demonstrates a classic tubal ring sign.  While the ring of fire is also discussed frequently, the ring of hypervascularity seen about a corpus luteum can be distracting and attempt to simulate this finding.
