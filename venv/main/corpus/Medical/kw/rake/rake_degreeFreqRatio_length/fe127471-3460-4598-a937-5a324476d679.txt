Texto: 
Labored breathing but without abnormal breath sounds. No tenderness to palpation of the lower extremities.
This patient was acutely anticoagulated with Heparin and admitted to the hospital.  She was ultimately transitioned to Warfarin to treat the multiple thrombi.
Bilateral filling defects of the pulmonary arteries.  While the timing is too early and the venous enhancement is poor on the DVT portion of the study, there are possible filling defects of the bilateral popliteal veins.  On the right, there is suggestion of a rim of enhancement surrounding a low density thrombus.  The left lung base demonstrates airspace opacity in a somewhat wedge-shaped appearance.
Pulmonary Embolus
Pulmonary embolus with 
Deep venous thrombosis

Possible Hemmorhagic infarct of the lung - Hampton's hump.
64 y/o woman with shortness of breath, hempoptysis, and left-sided chest pain.
If it would have affected management of this patient, the lower extremities would have been re-evaluated with ultrasound.  A major risk factor for this patient was a history of colon cancer and a contemporaneous finding of liver metastases that were found via pathology to be adenocarcinoma of the colon.
