PHYSICAL EXAM:	Large smooth annular plaques with raised edges were present on the anterior neck. The edges were firm, indurated, and erythematous and there was central clearing and mild atrophy. No scale was appreciated. There were papules which had coalesced into smaller annular plaques with central clearing and slight atrophy on the left and right inner upper arms.
LABORATORY DATA: TFTs: normal; CBC: normal; Glucose: normal; Electrolytes: normal; BUN/Creatinine: normal
HISTOPATHOLOGY: incisional biopsy. Sections demonstrated focal dermal granulomatous inflammation. Elastic stains revealed absence of elastic fibers within the zone of inflammation and normal elastic fibers bordering the zone of the inflammation. Scattered giant cells contained elastic fibers. The findings were
consistent with actinic granuloma (annular elastolytic granuloma).
Patient was started on topical temovate ointment, 0.5% BID for three weeks with 90% clinical improvement of the appearance of her lesions. She is currently using Westcort cream BID during weekdays and temovate ointment BID until her next follow-up (eight weeks).
ACTINIC GRANULOMA (ANNULAR ELASTOLYTIC GIANT CELL GRANULOMA) (1997 Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, Case#26) presented by: Jay L. Viernes, Maj, USAF, MC, FS
presented with a three year history of pruritic red circular and annular plaques on her anterior neck and left and right upper arms. The plaques seemed to be enlarging slowly since first noted. The patient reported that the lesions also occasionally burn. She denied any history of similar lesions in the past. There were no aggravating or alleviating factors. She had been prescribed  l% cortisone and various antifungals without relief.
