3/5 left lower extremity weakness.
Diminished proprioception.
Loss of vision in left eye.
Supportive
Non-contrast CT images of the brain demonstrate a 1.3 x 1.2 cm mass within the left optic nerve with multiple additional diffuse hemorrhagic lesions with associated vasogenic edema and mass effect.  The largest and most concerning mass is within the right frontal lobe.  This mass measures approximately 2.9 cm in greatest dimension.

A whole body bone scan demonstrates intense focal uptake at the left femoral head, and subtle intake within the mid right femoral diaphysis.
Malignant Melanoma
Metastatic carcinoma (breast, kidney, lung, thyroid)
melanoma, 
lymphoma
sarcoma
The patient is a 79-year-old woman who presented with a two-day history of left lower extremity weakness associated with loss of proprioception, and vomiting after falling and striking the back of her head.  The patient's past medical history is significant for multiple medical problems, including recent seizures.
Radiologic Diagnosis: Patients with melanoma of 1 mm thickness will undergo chest radiography.  Patients with advanced disease may undergo MR imaging of the head, as well as computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

However, single whole body positron emission tomography is quickly emerging as the study of choice to detect metastatic disease.
