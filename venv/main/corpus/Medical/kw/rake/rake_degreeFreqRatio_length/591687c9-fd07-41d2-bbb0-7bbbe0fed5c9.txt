•	Strength of the upper extremities revealed a left bicep to be weak graded 4/5, bilateral finger extension extensor weakness was noted and graded 4/5. Grip strength, tested using a Jamar dynamometer revealed he right hand to have 50 pounds of strength and the left hand to have 40 pounds of grip strength. He reports to being right hand dominant. Wight’s procedure was performed on either side and such was negative with no diminution of pulse. The costoclavicular procedure when performed on either side reproduced numbness into the fourth and fifth digits on the ipsilateral side. Follow up test with digital palpation and a compressive matter beneath the clavicle b/l and such did no reproduce his symptomatology of numbness in the 4th and 5th digits. With contralateral head rotation, ipsilateral left and right numbness into the 4th and 5th digits was reproduced when such was tested and additionally diminution of the pulse was noted. Roo’s test was positive bilaterally for numbness into the 4th and 5th digits bilaterally
This patient will continue to follow up with his chiropractor and primary character and will be monitored for improvement of his suspected TOS. The standard of care for thoracic out syndrome is a trial of nonoperative conservative management. A trial of conservative management should be attempted before surgical options are explored. It is thought that 2-3 years of conservative management is appropriate. Physical therapy should initially be explored for a period of at least four to six weeks. Exercises strengthen the muscles surrounding the shoulder and postural exercises help the patient to sit and stand straighter, potentially lessening pressure on neurovascular structures in the thoracic outlet. Other conservative measures include passage of time and weight reduction. Medical therapy can also be employed consisting of interscalene injection of anesthetic agents, steroids, or botulinum toxin type A. Surgical intervention should be explored if no progress is made after a trial of conservative management but as of now, this patient should be referred to a physical therapist.

There is no focal posterior disc herniation, central stenosis or foraminal narrowing.

Figure 2: T2 weighted MRI image with sagittal view of cervical spine with axial cut through C3-C4 disc space.
There is a disc bulge with effacement of the anterior CSF.  Spinal cord is not deformed.  There is at least mild foraminal narrowing.  Findings stable from previous study.

Figure 3: T2 weighted MRI image with sagittal view of cervical spine with axial cut through C4-C5 disc space.
There is a posterior disc protrusion herniation which is in contact with and deforms the spinal cord with a least mild to moderate central stenosis.  Mild foraminal narrowing is seen, there is posterior subluxation.  There is some loss of the disc space height.

Figure 4: T2 weighted MRI image with sagittal view of cervical spine with axial cut through C5-C6 disc space.
There is posterior subluxation which attenuates the posterior disc protrusion herniation.  The disc is in contact with and does deform the spinal cord.  There is loss of the disc space height and posterior subluxation.  Bilateral foraminal narrowing is seen.

Figure 5: T2 weighted MRI image with sagittal view of cervical spine with axial cut through C6-C7 disc space.
There is loss of the disc space height with posterior subluxation.  There is a posterior disc osteophyte complex with effacement of the anterior CSF.  Spinal cord is not deformed.  There is at least mild foraminal narrowing present.

Thoracic Outlet Syndrome
In this case we are most interested in the symptomatology producing the bilateral arm and hand numbness, weakness, and pain. Based on the symptomatology present, the fact that the correlation of symptoms can be linked to the MVA, and the presence of positive tests discussed in the physical examination, our most likely differential would be thoracic outlet syndrome. Other possible diagnosis worth considering on our differential include acromioclavicular joint injury, brachial plexus injury, cervical disc injuries, cervical discogenic pain syndrome, cervical radiculopathy, clavicle fractures, elbow and forearm overuse injuries, shoulder impingement syndrome, thoracic disc injuries, thoracic discogenic pain syndrome.
52 year-old African American male with a past medical history significant for past MVA, HTN, HLD and scoliosis with a recent MVA.  He reports the accident occurred as a belted driver of a moving vehicle that was hit on the front passenger side of another vehicle.  Upon impact, he reports a whiplash event as his body went forward and backward rapidly.  Per the patient, he reports bracing himself against the steering wheel upon impact.  He denies loss of consciousness, air bag deployment, or blood loss.  No ambulance was called to the scene.  The day after the collision, he was treated at an urgent care facility. He was examined and prescribed Naproxen and Robaxin. 

In the office today, the patient reports neck pain that radiates down both upper and lower extremities into the 4th and 5th hand digits bilaterally.  There is associated numbness in the aforementioned digits.  This pain is specifically associated with the MVA, as he states he did not have this symptomatology prior to the collision.  He also reports associated headaches on the left temporal region. The headache noted is constant with variable intensity.  The patient reports to baseline pain that is 3/10 in severity, with increase at times to 9/10. The pain is described as stabbing in the left temporal region. The pain has no temporal association and the patient cannot site any aggravating factors. Drinking alcohol alleviates the pain.  He reports the neck pain to be constant. The focal point of the neck pain is the center of the neck. The pain is currently 6/10, but can be 8/10 at times. No temporal relationship is described.  He does not cite any alleviating or aggravating factors associated with the pain.  There is numbness and pain that the patient classified as 4/10 bilaterally in the 4th and 5th digits of his hands.  There is also intermittent numbness in the left thigh radiating to the left foot.

There is certain subtleness to the presentation of thoracic outlet syndrome that makes diagnosing the condition a difficult and tedious task. A cautious and mindful physical exam when TOS is suspected is key to diagnosis.. When TOS is being considered, specific tests can be performed to confirm our suspicions.  

A majority of patients show "scapular ptosis" and atrophy of the ipsilateral trapezius muscle. Downward pressure on the ptotic scapula often reproduced paresthesia in the hand and arm, confirming the postural causation. Weakness of the trapezius may occur from trauma or a traction injury to the spinal accessory nerve, or some distal upper limb problem, causing the shoulder to be immobilized. All of the above may create a postural ptosis resulting in compression by pulling the nerves and vessels down onto the first rib.

Provocative tests used to help diagnose the condition.  These include Wright's test, in which the patient's arm is raised in varying degrees of elevation above the level of the shoulder.  The costoclavicular test is another test that is valuable in the diagnosis of TOS.  In this test, the patient brings the shoulders back in an exaggerated posture.  In the overhead exercise test, the patient holds the arms up and rapidly flexes and extends the fingers for 30 seconds. The Adson test can obliterate a pulse or produce a plethysmographic abnormality by assuming different positions. For the Wright’s test and the costoclavicular test to be considered positive, a patient must state that the symptoms have been reduplicated. Symptoms can include paresthesias or pain and cramping in the limb. The overhead exercise test requires a complaint of cramping or fatigue to be considered significant. Association of the typical symptoms of TOS, with at least one and preferably two of the provocative tests positive, leads to the probability of this condition. Manual muscle testing may reveal subtle deficits: in more severe cases, frank weakness of the interossei and hypothenar muscles and less in the flexor profundi of the little and ring fingers. 

Electrophysiological evaluation is indicated in anyone with suspected neurogenic TOS, although the majority of TOS patients test negative. When positive, the electrophysiological signature of neurogenic TOS is quite specific, though not sensitive. As in the case of our patient, EMG testing was negative and thus inconclusive.
