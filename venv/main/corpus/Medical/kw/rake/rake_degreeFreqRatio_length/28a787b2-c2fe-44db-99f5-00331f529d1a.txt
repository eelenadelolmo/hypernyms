Unremarkable physical exam.  No labs drawn.
The report of the study was sent to the ordering provider.  Given chronic symptoms, the patient will most likely proceed to arthroscopy for definitive treatment.
There is high signal on T2-weighted images, partially extending through the anterior labrum.  There is a paralabral multiseptated, multilobulated cyst which dissects along the anterior margin of the acetabulum over a length of 4.1 cm with a 2.4 cm cystic component positioned at the medial margin of the iliopsoas muscle, just lateral to the common iliac vasculature.  

No defect in the hyaline articular cartilage is identified.  Osseus structures demonstrate normal signal intensities.
Acetabulum, Partial Labrum Tear - Paralabral Cyst
Partial Labrum Tear
Complete Labrum Tear - no evident complete tear.
Osteoarthritis - no evident degenerative changes.
42 year-old woman with chronic bilateral hip pain. Normal plain films.
When a paralabral cyst is present, there must be a tear of the associated labrum.  In this case, the labral tear appears to be a partial tear only.
