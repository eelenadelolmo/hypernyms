Texto: 
She is obese and has a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and currently on oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for symptom control.  Exam is significant for her degree of discomfort and for confirming facial numbness.  The facial strength is intact bilaterally.
Admission and heparin drip anticoagulation.
The vein of Galen, straight sinus, and dominant left transverse venous dural sinus are particularly hyperattenuating, and apparently prominent in caliber.
 
The superior sagittal sinus is notably less hyperattenuating and is normal in appearance.  The right transverse dural venous sinus is hypoplastic.
 
Gray/white matter discrimination is preserved.  There is no evidence for infarction or intracranial hemorrhage.  There are no brain masses or mass effect.  There is no hydrocephalus.
 
The skull is intact.  The partially imaged aerated portions of the skull base are free of significant effusions..

Impression: The vein of Galen, straight sinus, and dominant left transverse venous dural sinus are all particularly hyperattenuating and apparently prominent in caliber, all very concerning for thrombosis.
Venous thrombosis of the vein of Galen, straight sinus, and dominant left transverse venous dural sinus.
Venous sinus thrombosis
Severe dehydration
Polycythemia
17 yo girl presents with left sided facial weakness and numbness and the worst headache of her life that is rated 10/10.  The headache has been progressive for about 24 hours.  She has a history of migraine, but the patient states that her current headache does not feel like her typical migraine headache.
Venous thrombosis is a medical emergency.  Complications include cerebral infarct and intracerbral hemorrhage.  Patients may present with headache, seizure, and focal neurologic deficits.  The neurologic findings can wax and wane.  Risk factors include the typical thrombosis risk factors such as pregnancy, OCP use, smoking, dehydration, and the hypercoaguable disorders.  

Radiographic findings include hyperdense venous structures.  One should be aware of a few diagnostic pitfalls, such as normally dense venous structures.  These structures can be more dense with dehydration or elevated hematocrit, but the density is concerning when the venous structures are more dense than arteries on non-contrast CT scans.  Other findings, such as infarct and hemorrhage, if present, can also help confirm a diagnosis of a venous sinus thrombosis.  CT angiography and MR venography (MRV) can be used to verify findings.  One common variant that can confuse the diagnostic picture is an aberrant or hypoplastic transverse sinus.
