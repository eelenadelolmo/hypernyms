79 year old female with incidental findings of a right lung nodule on virtual colonography.
This is an uncomplicated presentation of a common malignancy.  Undoubtedly, the patient's disease would have progressed significantly had she not sought screening CT colonography.  One of the benefits of screening CT colonography is in finding extra-colonic disease.  Clinically significant findings depend upon the screened population where age is the most important factor determining risk for extra-colonic malignancy.  It is generally agreed that in older populations (>70 y/o), the CT colonography technique has benefit in findings significant extra-colonic disease whereas virtual colonography and the potential benefit in discovering extra-colonic findings important in a younger screening population.
