Fifth metacarpal fracture.
Fracture.
31 year old African American male with no past medical history smelling of alcohol, complains of soreness in his hand after an altercation. Proud of his injury, the patient repeats over and over again "the best shot is a cheap shot!"
This patient has a fracture of the neck of the fifth metacarpal. Other names for this fracture include Boxer's fracture, Brawler's fracture or Street-fighter's fracture.

A boxer's fracture may involve any of the metacarpals, however it is most common in the fifth metacarpal.  The colloquialism is derived from punching a hard object with a closed fist. Some clinicians prefer to use the term Brawler's fracture because the trained pugilist knows not to strike with the knuckle of their fifth digit.  

If enough force is used the bone can become displaced or comminuted.  Complications from this type of fracture may result in malalignment and could have a significant effect on grip strength.
