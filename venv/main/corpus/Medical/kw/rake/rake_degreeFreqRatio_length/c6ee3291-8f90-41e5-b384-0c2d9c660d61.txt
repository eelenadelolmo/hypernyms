If the patient is a smoker, smoking should be discontinued.  Corticosteroids are used in progressive or systemic disease. Cytotoxic agents can be employed for patients who do not respond to smoking cessation or steroids. No treatment has been confirmed useful.
Lung transplantation also has been performed for treatment.  No specific criteria exist for determining which patients are candidates for lung transplantation. Patients with rapidly declining lung function, severe pulmonary symptoms, and a lack of response to other treatments are the best candidates for transplant consideration; however, the disorder may recur in the transplanted lung.
• Chest Radiographs:  Left sided pneumothorax with bilateral increased interstitial lung markings which are predominantly in an upper lobe distribution.

• Chest CT:  There is a moderate sized left-sided pneumothorax.  Linear reticular opacities and ground glass opacities are within the lingula, which likely represent atelectasis secondary to the pneumothorax.  There are multiple subcentimeter nodules throughout both lungs which are in a bronchovascular distribution.  There are multiple well defined and variable sized cysts throughout both lungs.  The nodules and cysts are most prominent in the upper lobes and superior segments of the lower lobes.  No evidence of central bronchiectasis.  Small left pleural effusion with left basilar atelectasis.
Pulmonary Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis
• Eosinophilic Granuloma (Pulmonary Langerhans Cell Histiocystosis)
• Sarcoidosis
• Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
• Atypical infectious process such as PCP pneumonia
• Laryngotracheal papillomatosis
• Lymphangioleiomyomatosis
• Williams-Campbell Syndrome
This 43 y.o. man presented to the ER with left sided chest pain and shortness of breath.  He had a spontaneous pneumothorax 5 years ago.
This patient has multiple thin-walled cysts with irregular shapes, centrilobular nodules smaller than 10 mm, an upper and middle lung zone predominance to the disease, relative sparing of lung bases, ground glass opacities, reticular opacities, and emphysematous changes which are all consistent with eosinophilic granuloma or pulmonary langerhans cell histiocytosis.  Additionally, 10-25% of patients with eosinophilic granuloma present with a spontaneous pneumothorax as did this patient.  Lymphangioleiomyomatosis almost exclusively occurs in middle aged females, has a diffuse distribution of thin walled and round cysts throughout the lungs, and rarely has centrilobular nodules making this diagnosis unlikely.  The patient denied any history of inhaling abnormal antigens to suggest a diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonia.  The patient was not immunocompromised making PCP pneumonia unlikely.  There was no evidence of bronchiectasis making Williams-Campbell syndrome and laryngotracheal papillomatosis unlikely as well.
