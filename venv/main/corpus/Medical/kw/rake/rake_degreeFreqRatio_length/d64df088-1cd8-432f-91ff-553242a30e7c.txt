PE: VSS. ABD: Tender RUQ with no rebound. Mild distention.
- HIDA scan or cholangiogram for leak localization. Percutaneous/endoscopic stent placement versus drain placement to be considered.
POST-OP DAY 2:
- Homogeneous fluid collection around the liver which appears to be layering in Morrison's pouch and delineating Gerota's fascia. Likely extracapsular by its appearance. 
- Clips/free intraperitoneal air in gallbladder fossae.
POST-OP DAY 11:
- Subcapsular hepatic collection of homogeneous attenuation. No complicated features appreciated. 
- Clips in gallbladder fossae.
Biliary leak
- Subcapsular hematoma.
- Bile leak/biloma.
- Abscess.
11 days s/p cholecystectomy with abdominal pain and elevated LFTs.
