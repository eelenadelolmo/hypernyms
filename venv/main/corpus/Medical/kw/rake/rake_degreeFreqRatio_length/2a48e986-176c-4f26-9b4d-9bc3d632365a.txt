Vitals: 100/64, HR107, RR12. T104.

FOCUSED PHYSICAL EXAM:
Heart: Regular rhythm. Tachycardic.
Abdomen: Soft, NT. Left hemiabdomen percutaneous nephrostomy tube clean, dry, intact. Capped. 

LABS:
ALB 2.4
AST 39
ALT 105
Alk Phos 347
TBILI 1.0

Creatnine 1.2

WBC 10.8

Blood cultures - Gram + cocci.
1) Long term antibiotics.
2) Follow up MRI ABD/PELVIS.
3) Transplant surveillance ultrasounds.
4) Close inteval follow up with Transplant Surgery.
HEPATIC ANGIOGRAM:
1) Frontal view - Approximately 40% stenosis at the transplant tie-in to the recipient replaced right hepatic artery. Focal narrowing of the intrahepatic arteries is high grade, however, flow appeared grossly adequate and treatment of these narrowings has high risk of further compromising arterial flow.  Of note, the gastroduodenal artery fills the celiac axis via the common hepatic artery.  The proper hepatic artery (which in this patient would only feed the left hepatic artery) has been tied off.  2) Oblique view - as above.
MRI ABDOMEN:
1) 5 MIN DELAY AXIAL T1 fSPGR FATSAT POSTGAD: Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilitation and beading. Cannot exclude new ischemia of the biliary tree given this appearance.
2) 70 SEC DELAY AXIAL T1 POSTGAD: Round ringed lesions - dark signal intensity centrally rimmed by bright signal intensity peripherally. Liver abscesses are favored in context of high fever, white count, and positive blood cultures. Cannot exclude biliary seeding as an abscess source in context of possible biliary ischemia.
HEPATIC ANGIOGRAM TO EVALUATE FOR VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS AFTER LIVER TRANSPLANT
ACUTE CHOLANGITIS
1) Infection of obstructed bile ducts
- Choledocholithiasis
- Stricture from prior surgery
- Sclerosing cholangitis
- Infected drainage catheter
- Ampullary, cholangio- carcinoma
2) Oriental cholangiohepatitis
3) Vascular compromise

CHRONIC CHOLANGITIS
1) Sclerosing cholangitis
- Primary: Idiopathic
- Secondary: IBD, Cirrhosis, Chronic active hepatitis, Retroperitoneal fibrosis, Pancreatitis
2) Obstuctive cholangitis
- Carcinoma
- Biliary cystadenoma
- Bile duct hamartoma
- Choledochal cysts
- Vascular compromise
54 year old African American male who is status post a left kidney (CRT) and liver transplant (OLT) 3 months prior to angiogram. The kidney was transplanted secondary to diabetic glomerulosclerosis and lipidosis and the liver secondary to PSC. History of hepatic artery thrombosis at time of transplant - coumadinized. During an admission for ARF (secondary to obstructive uropathy with stenosis at the ureteral anastemosis), patient demonstrates an acute increase in his liver enzymes and a decrease in his hepatic arterial flow velocities compared with an ultrasound one month prior.
