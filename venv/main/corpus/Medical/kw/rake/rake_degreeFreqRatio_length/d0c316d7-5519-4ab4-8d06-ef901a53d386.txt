None.  Documentation in the event of future surgeries and interventional procedures.
Three axial and one reformatted coronal image of the abdomen after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast demonstrates opacification of the abdominal aorta and less dense opacification of a fusiform structure to the left side of the abdomimal aorta.  To the right of the abdominal aorta is a fusiform structure that is not tubular as demonstrated on the coronal reformated images.  These are periaortic lymph nodes.
Left sided infrarenal inferior vena cava.
* Missed left infrarenal inferior vena cava due to the presence of lymph nodes.

* Duplicated inferior vena cava.
Patient diagnosed with testicular cancer and CT scan ordered to screen for lymphadnopathy.
The infrarenal inferior vena cava is formed by the right and left distal supracardinal veins.  Normally, the left regresses and the right persists to become the infrarenal inferior vena cava.  When both the right and left supracardinal veins persist, duplication of the inferior vena cava exists and is associated with renal anomalies according to Mani et al. in "Case Report: Duplication of IVC and Associated Renal Anomalies: Ind J Radiol Imag 2000;10.
