Texto: 
No specific findings noted. Possibly enlarged and irregular uterus on bimanual exam.
Depending on the patient's symptoms, surgical options may be discussed.
Numerous areas of discrete low signal intensity in the muscle of the uterus and below the serosa. Uterus is irregularly enlarged.
Uterine Leiomyoma
-Adenomyosis
-Leiomyosarcoma
-Endometrial polyps
-Endometrial cancer
Patient referred by OB-Gyn for pelvic MRI. No symptoms noted.
Lesions/Condition: Uterine Leiomyoma 

Cell of Origin: Smooth muscle cells of uterus 

Synonyms: Fibroids 

Associations/Predisposing Factors: Increase estrogen states, pregnancy, african american, obesity, perimenopausal 

Common Locations: Uterus; submucosal, intramural, subserosal 

Demographics: About 25% of American women and about 40% of African American women by age 40. 

Gross Morphology: Smooth muscle tissue 

Histology: Smooth muscle tissue with a pseudocapsule 

Radiology: Ultrasound shows areas of hyperechogenicity and an enlarged uterus. MRI shows discrete areas of low signal intensity and an irregularly enlarged uterus. 

Treatment: Usually expectant management. If symptomatic, treated with medications to decrease estrogen (Provera, danazol, GnRH agonists), uterine artery embolization, myomectomy, endometrial ablation, or hysterectomy.
