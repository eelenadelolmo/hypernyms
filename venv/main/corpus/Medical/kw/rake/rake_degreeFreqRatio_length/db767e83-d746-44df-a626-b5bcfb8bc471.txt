MRI of spine demonstrated small central disc herniation at L5-S1. Concentric bulging disc and annular tears at L4-L5 and L3-L4 level. 

Chest Xray demonstrated small left pleural effusion with subsegmental atelectasis at the left base.
Pulmonary Thromboembolism associated with Pregnancy, small lumbar disc herniation.

22 year old woman, G2P0, 17 wks pregnant presented to ED after an automobile accident. As per patient, she was driving straight when a car trying to make left turn hit the front side.

Patient denied any tingling or numbness in arms, gait issues, ataxia, vision problems, vomiting, tinnitus, and bladder or bowel dysfunction. 
MRI of spine was done which demonstrated disc herniation. Details of the imaging will be discussed in the next section. One week later patient had a miscarriage. Patient was recommended to start chiropractic treatment 3 times  for 2 weeks for back and shoulder pain. Two months later, after one of her treatment session patient suddenly experienced shortness of breath and chest pain. Chest pain located in mid sternum and left side.

Patient is a 22 year old woman who had a miscarriage 1 week after being involved in an automobile accident.  It is a credit to the treating doctor of chiropractic that the appropriate referrals were made for evaluation.  Patient at that time was 17weeks pregnant. 2 months later she experienced sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. CT of chest was consistent with PE. Risk factors for pulmonary embolism in this patient includes recent pregnancy and decreased ambulation post accident.   The patient is improving with chiropractic treatment received.
