On initial exam, the patient had some confusion and decreased orientation to her surroundings. Cranial nerves 2 through 12 were intact bilaterally, with pupils being equal, round and reactive to light and an oropharynx appearing moist and clear of any lesions; jugular venous distension was not noted. Chest examination revealed an elevated heart rate of greater than 95, tachypnea of over 20 breaths per minute and bilateral rhonci in the anterior lung fields. Abdominal examination was unremarkable, including a negative hepatojugular reflex, and the lower extremities were non-edematous bilaterally. The patient was placed on 3 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula and was saturating well at 96% on pulse oximetry. Persistent confusion and tachypnea, however, prompted intubation with mechanical ventilation.
* Following the above-described plain film of the chest, the patient underwent bronchoscopy, which confirmed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage as being causative of the abnormalities seen on imaging. Moreover, nursing staff noted the patient to be anuric with a serum potassium of 7.3, creatinine of 22.81, but no evidence of structural kidney disease on renal ultrasonography. To investigate for potential autoimmune vasculitis, further studies were performed, which included serum C3 of 128, C4 of 104, p-ANCA staining pattern and positive anti-GBM antibodies of >8.0 AI. It is important to note that definitive diagnosis would require a kidney biopsy with demonstration of a linear immunofluorescence pattern. The patient, however, declined to have a biopsy performed and instead opted for comfort care.


The patient was started methylprednisolone for Goodpasture disease. She completed 3 days of intravenous methylprednisolone, 1 gram daily, and was then changed to both prednisone, 80 mg daily by mouth, and cyclophosphamide, 100 mg daily by mouth, both of which she was given for a total of 5 days. Simultaneously with cyclophosphamide and prednisone, the patient completed 5 days of plasmapharesis, after which she opted for comfort care, as noted above.
Chest x-ray revealed multifocal patchy and nodular opacities throughout both lungs. These findings, initially, were reported to be consistent with either multifocal bronchopneumonia or underlying malignancy of lungs, either from primary or metastatic disease. Another condition that would explain these findings, although less common, would be diffuse alveolar hemorrhage secondary to autoimmune vasculitis.
Goodpasture syndrome
The differential diagnosis for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage includes:

General medical conditions:
-Pneumonia
-Malignancy
-Acute respiratory distress syndrome
-Pulmonary toxicity from cytotoxic therapy

Occurring in the setting of pathologic capilaritis:

-Immune complex-mediated vasculitis (primary)
-->Goodpasture syndrome
-->Henoch-Schonlein purpura

-Vasculitis (secondary)
-->Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome
-->Dermatomyositis, polymyositis
-->Mixed connective tissue disease
-->Systemic lupus erythematosus

-Idiopathic small vessel vasculitis (primary)
-->Churg-Strauss syndrome
-->Microscopic polyangitis
-->Wegner's granulomatosis

Occurring outside of pathologic capilaritis:
-Coagulopathy (secondary to anti-platelet therapy or DIC, for example)
-Goodpasture syndrome
-Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis

The patient presented to the hospital with four weeks of sinusitis and progressive dyspnea.
When patients present with multi-systemic illness, it is critical to evaluate the potential for a single disease entity as being causative of their symptoms. This is especially true in the case of diagnoses, including Goodpasture syndrome, that fall under the category of autoimmune vasculitis. One 2017  study, for example, described a 73 year-old male who presented with small-volume hemoptysis and went on to develop acute kidney injury while hospitalized. He was discharged with diagnoses of both acute tubular injury and interstitial nephritis secondary to the receipt of cephalosporin, only to return in two days with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. A kidney biopsy revealed lymphocytic proliferation in vessels of medium size along with non-caseating granulomas of the interstitium, confirming polyarteritis nodosa as a diagnosisÂ¹. The case presented here has a similar teaching point, as the patient presented with respiratory distress and kidney injury, which were originally considered to be isolated processes but were, in fact, related by Goodpasture syndrome.

Another important teaching point presented by this case is that of evaluating diffuse alveolar hemorrhage clinically. The differential diagnosis for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, already, is quite broad, and notably includes a variety of diseases that fall under the classification of autoimmune vasculitis, including Goodpasture syndrome, as discussed in this case. In 2013, a researcher published in Tuberculosis and respiratory diseases an algorithmic approach to identifying an underlying diagnosis in the case of patients presenting with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The first steps include bronchoalveolar lavage, with biopsy and culture as indicated, and clinical history. One arm of the algorithm then points to confirming the diagnosis as being secondary to either infection or malignancy, while the other arm involves a full rheumatologic evaluation, including tests for antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and even anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies. The author ultimately concluded, and highlighted using this algorithm, that most diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is, in fact, caused by pulmonary capillaritis in the setting of systemic vasculitis, so the aforementioned rheumatologic workup is an almost essential component of making a definitive diagnosisÂ². 

Another retrospective study in 2016 reported similar findings across six clinical cases of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Presenting symptoms varied, but included renal dysfunction, hemoptysis, hematuria and bleeding from mucosal surfaces. All six patients, however, had documented hypoxemia, anemia and chest CTs that revealed alveolar filling as well as diffuse infiltrates. Laboratory studies in 5 of 6 patients revealed elevated C-reactive protein and ESR, positive serum ANCA in 3 of 6 cases and positive anti-GBM antibodies in 1 patient. Following pathological analysis, 2 patients with diagnosed with Microscopic polyangiitis, 2 more with Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, 1 with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, and 1 with Goodpasture syndromeÂ³. This study, again, points to an association between diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and vasculitis, and to the importance of rheumatologic laboratory studies in evaluating such patients. It is worth noting, however, that larger studies have not been widely conducted in order to test the strength of this association, and more research is warranted before the institution of clinical guidelines.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, in summary, is a unique clinical entity that often presents in the setting of multi-systemic illness. Its presence radiographically, if accompanied by kidney injury, should prompt consideration of and workup for Goodpasture syndrome, along with other types of autoimmune vasculitis.
