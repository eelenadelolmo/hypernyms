Texto: 
normal TSH/T4
PA and lateral CXR demonstrate abnormal contour to superior mediastinum
CT neck demonstrates large substernal goiter, predominantly orignating from left thyroid lobe.  This displaces the normal vasculature laterally, producing the abnormal contour on chest radiograph.
thyroid goiter
substernal goiter (thyroid)
thymoma
teratoma
lymphoma

Considering there is continuity between the left lobe of the thyroid and the substernal portion of the thyroid and that they are of similar high density, substernal thyroid is the most likely diagnosis.
67 y/o WM with abnormal CXR
