Plain film of the abdomen demonstrate a non-aggressive mixed sclerotic and lytic lesion affecting the right ilium.

Oblique reconstructed CT images from thin-section axial CT images demonstrate coarsened trabeculae in a radial pattern within the right ilium extending from the body to the crest, approximating vascular channels.
