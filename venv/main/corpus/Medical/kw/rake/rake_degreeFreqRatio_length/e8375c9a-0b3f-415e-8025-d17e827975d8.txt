Left adenexal fullness on bimanual exam.
Ultrasound demonstrates a solid left adnexal mass that is separate from the left ovary.  MRI confirms a solid left adenexal mass contiguous with the uterus and signal charateristics compatible with a uterine fibroid.
Exophytic uterine Leiomyoma
exophytic uterine fibroid
broad ligament fibroid
Ovarian Neoplasm - potentially fibrothecoma or other stromal tumor

In a setting of a +hCG, ectopic pregnancy.
Patient with left sided pelvic pain.
When a seperate ovary is difficult to identify, the differential concern is for ovarian neoplasm.  Similarly, in a setting of a +hCG, these raise a concern for a tubal ectopic, expecially when cystic degeneration or torsion of the mass is present with associated pain.
