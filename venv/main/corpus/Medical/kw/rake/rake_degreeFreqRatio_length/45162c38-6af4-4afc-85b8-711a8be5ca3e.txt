The left vertebral artery at the level of the foramen magnum is normal to increased in size with an absent flow void when compared to the right.  The left vertebral artery then narrows for a two centimeter segment prior to reaching the basilar artery.
Vertebral Artery Dissection
Vertebral artery dissection.
65 year old white male presents with several year history of vertigo.
The patient was clinically reevaluated after these findings were discussed with the ordering provider.  The patient stated his vertigo had been chronic and stable for several years and he had no new symptoms of vertebral artery distribution ischemia.  The clinical scenario coupled with longus capitis muscle atrophy (not shown) indicate that this is a chronic condition.
