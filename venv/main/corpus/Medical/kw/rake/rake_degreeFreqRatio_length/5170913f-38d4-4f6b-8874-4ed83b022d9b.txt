Conservative Measures.
Treatment of complications secondary to increased risk of stone formation, obstruction and infection
• Renal fusion or isthmus crossing aorta at IMA
• Low position and malrotated (anteriorly directed renal pelvis)
• Enhancing/functioning renal isthmus
Renal Ectopia with Horseshoe Kidney
• Renal Ectopia-fusion
• Lump, cake, disk, or horseshoe kidney
• Aberrant arterial supply (may cause obstruction)
15 y.o. boy with a history of arachnoid cyst and megacolon  - now presenting with urinary incontinence over the past year.  Currently complaining of occasional right flank pain.  Reports intermittent hematuria.
Hematuria as seen in this patient is not necessarily a complication of a horseshoe kidney.  Hematuria may be secondary to stone formation or infection - which the patient is at risk for secondary to kidney morphology.  No stone was identified on this study.
