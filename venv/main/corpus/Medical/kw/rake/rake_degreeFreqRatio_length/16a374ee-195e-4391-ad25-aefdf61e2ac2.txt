Texto: 
Left hip/groin pain.
The patient was treated conservatively and the follow-up plain films are consistent with a healing femoral neck stress fracture.
An area of low signal intensity in the left femoral neck on T1-weighted spin echo images.  On T2 fast spin echo inversion recovery images a high signal is seen in the area corresponding to the T1-weighed images.  A small joint space effusion is seen along with minimal soft tissue swelling. 
Plain film demonstrate a focal area of sclerosis along the femoral neck consistent with healing femoral neck stress fracture.
Femoral Neck Stress Fractures
Based on report of plain film findings, generic differential diagnosis of sclerotic bone lesion.
Mnemonic = VINDICATE

Vascular: hemangiomas, infarct 
Infection: chronic osteomyelitis 
Neoplasm: primary (osteoma, osteosarcoma), metastatic (prostate, breast, other) 
Drugs: Vitamin D,fluoride 
Inflammatory/Idiopathic: 
Congenital: bone islands, osteopoikilosis, osteopetrosis, pyknodysostosis 
Autoimmune: 
Trauma: fracture (stress) 
Endocrine/Metabolic: hyperparathyroidism, Paget's disease
20 yo female for MRI evaluation of “left hip pain,” with prior plan film reportedly demonstrating an area of sclerosis and lucency.
