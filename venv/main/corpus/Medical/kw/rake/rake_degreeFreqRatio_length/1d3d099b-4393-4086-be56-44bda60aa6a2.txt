Back: Mild tenderness to palpation over lower thoracic/upper lumbar spine.

CSF: LP opening pressure: 18 cm H2O, wbc=32,rbc=2, glc=53, prtn=92  76%lymphs. Gram stain: pmns present. no organisms.

CBC: 5.68>10.6/31.6<443

CMP: 140/4.4/99/29/11/0.5<95, Ca 9.6, PO4 4.8, Mg 1.6
Pt underwent antibiotics treatment both as an inpatient and outpatient with improvement. However, follow-up MRI revealed no direct cord compression despite remaining inflammatory changes and parapinal inflammation.  The T10-T11 disc space showed near complete obliteration.
Initial plain radiograph showed narrowed disk space between T10-T11 and left paraspinal mass

-MRI showed paraspinal mass in the anterior paraspinal soft
tissues at T10-T11. T10-and T11 and intervertebral disc space show low signal intensity on T1 that becomes high signal intensity on T2 and enhanced after contrast consistent with vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis with paraspinal mass.
Citrobacter koseri osteomyelitis/discitis
1. Discitis/osteomyelitis
2. Pott's Disease
52 y/o AA male recently deployed soldier who was medically evacuated due to chronic back pain that interfered with his duties as a truckdriver.  While being evaluated stateside, his pain worsened  and he had  a lumbar puncture which revealed signs consistent with a potential infection.  An MRI was then obtained for further evalutaion.
Culture of the CT-guided biopsy material from the this patient yielded Citrobacter koseri.  This organism is a rare cause of vertebral osteomyelitis.  Vertebral osteomyelitis due to Citrobacter koseri has been reported in the literature only in association with preceding infections such as a pneumonia or bacteremia, endocarditis in a pacemaker lead, or in the  postoperative period following transurethral prosatectomy.  This organism is relatively non-virulent. Citrobacter infections are usually nosocomial and are acquired as a result of instrumental seeding from the commonly colonized gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract.  In adults, Citrobacter infections most frequently involve the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts, soft tissue wounds, and occasionally bone. That the current patient had no history of bacteremia, invasive procedure, abdominal or pelvic infection, or soft tissue wound, which is atypical history for this particular pathogen.
