Subsequent to the successful contrast enema reduction, the patient was admitted to the pediatric service for observation. After an uneventful two day stay the patient was discharged home.
Scout: Soft tissue mass left mid-abdomen
Flouroscopy: Initial identification of a soft tissue meniscus preventing the free flow of contrast at the level of the sigmoid colon, consistent with the suspected diagnosis of an intussusception.  Subsequent images demonstrate reduction of the intussusception with reflux of contrast into the terminal ileum seen on real-time imaging.
