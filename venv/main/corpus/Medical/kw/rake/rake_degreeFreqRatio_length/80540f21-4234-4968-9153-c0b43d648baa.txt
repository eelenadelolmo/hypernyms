hCG 2100 (3rd International Standard)

Diffuse abdominal pain.
Preliminary u/s by ER physician unable to identify an IUP.
The patient did well post-op and was discharged to home.
Transabdominal images demonstrate a large heterogeneous mass filling the pelvis.  The normal architecture of the uterus is difficult to discern.  The ovaries are also unable to be identified.

Transvaginal images demonstrate a similar appearance with no internal blood flow within this mass and a seperate normal uterus without IUP seen eccentrically displaced anteriorly and to the left within the pelvis.
Ruptured Ectopic Pregnancy
Fibroid Uterus with Missed AB
Hematoma / Ruptured ectopic
Hematometrosis
Complex pelvic mass - 
        Ovarian tumor
        Complex ovarian cyst from hemorrhage /  Endometriosis
        Soft tissue tumor - Sarcoma
Prior history of a spontaneous AB and a ectopic (side not known) presenting to an ER in Alabama while driving to Virginia secondary to pelvic pain and +home pregnancy kit.  U/S performed at that time reported as Spontaneous AB.

Patient completed here road trip to Virginia and presented to the hospital with persistent pelvic pain.
With very large abnormalities, it is sometimes difficult to see the forest through the trees.  For this case it required going from transabdominal to transvaginal and back to transabdominal for the tech to recognize what was being seen.  This patient was very fortunate that the hematoma stopped further bleeding.  No free flowing blood/fluid was identified in the Morrison's pouch.
