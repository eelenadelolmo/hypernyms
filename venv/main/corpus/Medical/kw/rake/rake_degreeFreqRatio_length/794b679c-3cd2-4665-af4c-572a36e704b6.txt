The right internal jugular vein was accessed using ultrasound and Seldinger technique, and a 10Fr sheath was manipulated into the middle hepatic vein.  Wedge pressure was 60-70mm Hg.  Free hepatic vein pressure was 20-30mm Hg.  

Exchange was made for a Rosch TIPS needle sheath assembly, which was manipulated into the middle hepatic vein.  The right portal vein was accessed near its junction with the portal vein. Initial contrast injection demonstrated opacification of the right portal vein and its branches.  

Access into the right portal vein was lost, and a second pass with the TIPS needle was made.  The portal vein was accessed at the bifurcation.  Portal venous pressure measured 35-42mm Hg. Contrast injection this time demonstrated preferential flow into collateral vessels. 

Exchange was made for a 8mm x 8cm angioplasty balloon, which was used to dilate the tract.  A marker pigtail was passed, and a portal venogram was obtained which again demonstrated preferential flow into collateral vessels. 

Exchange was made for Viatorr catheter assembly.  A 10mm diameter Viatorr stent with a 5cm covered portion was deployed across the tract and dilated with the 8mm x 8cm angioplasty balloon.  Repeat contrast study demonstrated wide patency of the stent graft, and final pressures demonstrated portal venous pressure of 21-32mm Hg with a stent-graft gradient of 6-8mm Hg.
Trans-jugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt
Patient is a 76 year old female with right hydrothorax and intractable ascites secondary to cryptogenic cirrhosis.
