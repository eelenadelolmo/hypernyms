81yo Caucasian female presented with 1-week history of nausea and vomiting.  She had an exploratory laparotomy 18 years ago for abdominal pain.  She was sent for an abd/pelvis CT scan for suspicion of diverticulitis.
Due to the high risk of strangulation, surgery is the recommended treatment for Spigelian hernias.  Since this patient had no evidence of incarceration at this time, she had surgery as an outpatient.
