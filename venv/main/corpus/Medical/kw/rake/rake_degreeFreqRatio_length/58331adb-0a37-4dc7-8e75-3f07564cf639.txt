A sonographic Murphy's Sign was obtained during the ultrasound examination.
The patient underwent a cholecystectomy shortly after these images were obtained. There were multiple stones within the gall bladder with slight thickening of the gall bladder wall. A one cm diameter stone was found lodged in the cystic duct.
This gall bladder displays the "Wall-Echo-Shadow" sign which consists of a thickened wall (here measured as 3.7 mm thick) followed by multiple echoes (from gallstones) with a posterior shadow (due to the gallstones filling the gall bladder).
Cholelithiasis
Cholelithiasis within the gall bladder is the most likely reason for the "Wall-Echo-Shadow" sign, although a calcified gall bladder wall from cholangiocarcinoma could produce a similar finding.
29 year old Caucasian man complaining of the acute onset of right abdominal pain.
The ultasound findings in combination with the clinical presentation were highly suggestive of acute cholecystitis requiring surgical intervention.
