CBC shows an MCV of 115.
Parenteral B12 injection is the traditional therapy - IM or SubQ.  However, recent reports have shown both safety and efficacy for high dose oral B12 of 1 milligram (1,000 µg) of vitamin B12 consumed daily.

60 y/o man with rapid onset of gait ataxia and loss of proprioception. He had shoulder surgery 2 weeks prior and received nitrous oxide anesthesia.
This patient had nitrous oxide anesthesia for shoulder surgery a few months prior to admission. He also had EGD (esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy) that showed an atrophic gastritis. On his CBC there was a macrocytosis with an MCV of 115 (normal 80-100) . His serum B12 level was found to be 42, with a normal range of 190-900. He was started on vitamin B12 injections and his neurologic status began to gradually improve.
