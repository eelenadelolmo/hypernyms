Conservative treatment with physical therapy and passive range of motion exercises is the first performed.  A small percentage of patients will have persistent symptoms in which distention arthrography leading to capsular rupture, manipulation under anesthesia, or arthroscopic capsular release may be attempted.
Coronal T2 weighted images show joint capsule and synovial thickening at the level of the axillary recess that is greater than 4 mm in max diameter.
