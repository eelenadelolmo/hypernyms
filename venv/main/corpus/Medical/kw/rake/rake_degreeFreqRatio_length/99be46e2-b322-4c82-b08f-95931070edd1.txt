These are usually incidental findings, do not grow, and do not require treatment.

Of course, there is always the opportunity for an elective surgical procedure, such as liposuction. ;~)
T1 sagittal and axial T2 images demonstrate a curvilinear hyperintense lesion that is adjacent to the body of the corpus callosum and extends to the region of the splenium. There is dysgenesis of the splenium and posterior body of the corpus callosum. On the axial T2 images, the mass is hyperintense with a rim of hypointensity which likely represents chemical shift artifact.
