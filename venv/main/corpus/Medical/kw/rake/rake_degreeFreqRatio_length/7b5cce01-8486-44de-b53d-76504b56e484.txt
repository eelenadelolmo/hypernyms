For all pledgets placed within patient to detect leak (bilateral nasopharynx, spenoethmoid and anterior nasal cavity regions), pledget-to-plasma ratio > 2.
Normal radionuclide cisternography.  No radiotracer uptake was seen outside the confines of the CSF-containing spaces.
Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak
Intermittent, spontaneous clear drainage from nose. No history of trauma or surgery.
Despite the appearance of normal images, a CSF leak was confirmed in this patient from activity of individual pledgets. 

In this patient with suspected spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea , a highly sensitive test is warranted, and one which evaluates for the leak over a significant period of time (i.e. 24 hours).

While radionuclide cisternography is highly sensitive, it lacks anatomic detail.  Especially in the cases of post-surgical or traumatic CSF leaks, cross-sectional based studies are essential. High-resolution CT (noncontrast), often performed in prone position, will often show the intracranial bony defect, and in some recent series, high-resolution CT identified significantly more patients with CSF leak than did radionuclide cisternography and CT cisternography.

Early promise has also been shown with MR cisternography, using either heavily T2-weighted studies or low-dose gadolinium (instilled in lumbar subarachnoid space)-to confirm the presence and determining the focus of active CSF leaks.

Management of CSF rhinorrhea includes conservative treatment (bedrest for 1 week in head up position), stool softeners (to decrease strain associated with bowel movements), blood patches, steroids or early surgical repair
