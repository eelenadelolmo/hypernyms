No focal signs or symptoms
Surgery
• Extra-axial right frontal mass with large fluid ("cystic") spaces.
• Moderate amount of edema.
Cystic Meningioma, atypical
• Meningioma (atypical imaging appearance)
• Glioma (glioblastoma)
• Abscess
81 year old woman who had a prior CT scan for confusion.
Originally, with only CT, the mass was thought to be an abscess.
MRI done for further evaluation revealed additional features that were inconsistent with abscess. This lesion is a meningioma, that has large fluid ("cystic") components - which is atypical.  The lesion is difficult to definitively localize as extraaxial on the imaging studies.
