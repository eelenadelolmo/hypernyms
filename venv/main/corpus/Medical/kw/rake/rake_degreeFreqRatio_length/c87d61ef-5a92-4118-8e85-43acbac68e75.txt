Mild right upper quadrant tenderness.
Gallbladder rupture is treated by cholecystectomy.
The initial abdominal CT was normal, with a normally distended gallbladder. Follow up CT a few days after the injury appeared to demonstrate denser-than-bile pericholecystic fluid and a flaccid, serpentine-walled gallbladder; again no injury was demonstrated elsewhere in the abdomen.
Edematous gallbladder wall (not rupture)
Traumatic gallbladder rupture (previously healthy young man)
Edematous gallbladder wall related to vigorous hydration
22 yo previously healthy man sustained blunt abdominal trauma during a motor vehicle accident.
This case demonstrates that traumatic gall bladder rupture may be mimicked by a sequela of aggressive hydration.
