The patient was noted to be alert and oriented in no acute distress. Vital signs were heart rate 83, respiratory rate 14, and temperature 102.3. Pertinent exam findings were bibasilar rales on lung exam with right greater than left and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
This patient was admitted for treatment with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin. Radiographic  and clinical evidence of improvement was apparent within 36 hours.
A right upper lobe airspace opacity with a consolidation pattern is present with sharp demarcation along the right minor fissure inferiorly, with extension into the hilum.  There is bilateral blurring of the costophrenic recesses consistent with an effusion. There is tracheal deviation consistent with previously known thyroid enlargement of unknown etiology. The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
Right upper lobe pneumonia.
The differential for a consolidative pattern on chest X-ray with this patient’s history includes: A: an exudate caused by pneumonia (typical vs. atypical) or pneumonitis B: A transudate caused by pulmonary congestion C: Malignancy related, which may be primary or metastatic.
This is a 77 year old female with past medical history significant only for diagnosis of a gastrointestinal stromal cell tumor one year ago treated with Gleevec (imatinib) presents to the emergency department with a one day history of fatigue, dry cough, chills and nausea with vomiting. She denied shortness of breath but does report some chest pain with deep inspiration.
This patient, a 77-year-old female demonstrates physical, symptomatic and radiographic evidence of a community acquired “typical” pneumonia. This patient is more susceptible to respiratory infections given her current treatment with Gleevec (imatinib). Typical symptoms include sudden onset of malaise, fever, diaphoresis, chills, cough (usually productive) along with pleuritic-type chest pain and SOB. Other features commonly seen in this type of pneumonia include nausea and vomiting and less frequently, mental status changes. This patient demonstrated many of these symptoms. Physical exam of the lungs may reveal rales, egophony, generally decreased breath sounds, tactile fremitus, and dullness to percussion over the affected area.  This patient is noted to have significant rales on the affected lung side.      
     Importantly, radiographic findings are most likely to reveal a consolidative pattern. This patient is noted to have a consolidative opacity with a sharp lower border along the minor fissure. This is strong evidence that her pneumonia is anatomically confined to the right upper lobe. Location can be confirmed by examining the lateral film. This pattern is differs from “atypical” pneumonias, which are more likely to demonstrate an infiltrative pattern. However, differentiation is generally not possible based on radiographic examination alone. Therefore, diagnosis is confirmed based upon radiographic evidence combined with clinical presentation and other studies, such as a sputum sample.      
     Likely pathogens for a typical pneumonia include Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenza, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and many other bacteria and mixed bacterial etiologies. Diagnosis of typical pneumonia is made even more likely by her immediate response to antibiotics specific to these bacteria.       
     The patient is also noted to have bilateral pleural effusions. This is most likely associated her use of Gleevec; edema is a commonly associated side effect. Given the patient’s history of gastrointestinal cancer, there is concern that her radiographic findings may be indicative of a post-obstructive process associated with pulmonary metastasis or primary cancer; however, she had a CT 2 weeks prior that showed no such findings and her presentation is more consistent with community acquired pneumonia.
