Well-appearing woman in no acute distress.  Neurologically, she was alert and oriented.  Pupils were equal and reactive.   Extraocular movements were intact.  No visual field deficits were revealed.  She moved all extremities symmetrically.
Vancomycin 1g IV q12, ceftazidime 2g IV q8, and
metronidazole 500 mg IV q6
Axial T2 fast spin echo image demonstrates a high right parietal lobe lesion with surrounding vasogenic edema.  Axial diffusion-weighted image reveals restricted diffusion in the lesion.  Sagittal post-contrast T1-weighted MR image demonstrates a rim-enhancing mass with surrounding edema.
Brain abscess
"MAGIC DR"
1. Metastatic Lesion: carcinoma and sarcomas.  Must also consider primary tumors: High grade glioma, meningioma, lymphoma, leukemia, pituitary macrodenoma, acoustic 
neuroma, craniopharyngioma.
2. Abscess: bacterial, fungal, parasitic and empyema ( epidural,  subdural )
3. Glioma
4. Infarct (resolving infarction,  aging hematoma,  Operative bed following resection,  thrombosed aneurysm)
5. Contusion
6. De- myelinating Disease: radiation necrosis and necrotizing leukoencephalopathy with methotrexate
7. Resolving hematoma
75-year-old woman who initially presented with left-sided weakness and headache
It is difficult to differentiate various types of abscesses and cystic brain tumors such as high-grade gliomas and metastases with conventional imaging.   Abscesses typically occur more frequently in the first 4 decades of life with a triad of fever, headache (often severe and on the side of the abscess), and focal neurologic deficit in about  half of patients. Brain abscesses are rare in immunocompetent individuals and more typically seen in immunosuppressed individuals, such as patients with AIDS, bone marrow and solid organ transplants, and neutropenia.  In adults, common primary sources of infection include ear and sinus infections, otitis and dental abscesses.  Among the common distant foci of infection are hematogenous spread of infection from a distant site such as  pyogenic lung processes and endocarditis .  In young children however, bacterial meningitis, has decreased significantly due to the haemophilus influenzae vaccine. 
The development of abscess is characterized by four stage: early cerebritis, late cerebritis, early capsule formation, and late capsule formation.

Many authorities consider MRI  imaging has the advantage over CT for evaluating the early cerebritis stage of brain abscesses.  T1-weighted images enhance the abscess capsule, the abscess center is hypointense and after gadolinium there is enhancement of the abscess rim.  On T2-weighted images the abscess can demonstrate the edema zone around the abscess.  Diffusion-weighted  imaging (DWI) may also be useful in distinguishing abscesses from cystic brain tumors. Cerebral abscess will usually have restricted diffusion and is hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images,  while cystic or necrotic tumor typically has free diffusion and is hypointense on such images.
