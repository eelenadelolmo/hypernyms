Image #1:
Left renal upper polar heterogeneous increased uptake, with enlarged area of heterogenous photopenia at the inter- to lower pole. Intense multifocal uptake in the anterior mandible likely represents prior dental work vs. periodontal disease.

Image #2:
Same findings, spot view.

Image #3 and #4:
Large heterogeneous soft tissue mass infiltrating the left inter- and lower renal pole extending to the abdominal wall and invading renal pelvic structures and demonstrating mild heterogeneous contrast enhancement.

Tc-99m MDP is a commonly employed skeletal radiopharmaceutical. Diphosphonate labeled Tc-99m rapidly disperses throughout the extracellular space and accumulates in regions of increased osteogenic / osteoblastic activity and regions of increased blood flow. Adequate bone uptake and target to background ratio for skeletal imaging is generally obtained 2-3 hours after injection. Tc-99m MDP is primarily renally cleared through glomerular filtration. A simple planar gamma scintillation camera windowed around Tc-99m’s characteristic 140 KeV decay is used to obtain planar whole body and spot views. SPECT can be added if further lesion localization is required. 

In a normal whole body bone scan, activity is greatest in the axial skeleton and relatively lower in the appendicular skeleton. The kidneys should always be visualized and be less intense than the lumbar spine. 

Asymmetry or irregularity of the kidneys should always spur further evaluation. Frequently ultrasound or CT are chosen based on the clinical circumstances, risk factors, and suspicions. In this case the patient received a contrast enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis. 

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) presents most commonly with hematuria, flank pain, palpable mass, and weight loss. Risk factors include tobacco use, family history, and chronic dialysis among others. On CT, heterogeneous contrast enhancement and varying degrees of hemorrhage and necrosis are apparent. Ten percent calcify and a few percent demonstrate cystic regions. On ultrasound, RCC is most frequently hyperechoic but can be hypoechoic up to 30% of the time. Stage I disease is confined to the kidney, Stage II is confined to Gerota’s fascia, Stage III demonstrates venous invasion (A) or lymph node metastasis (B) or both (C), and stage IV demonstrates direct extension into adjacent organs and/or distant organ metastasis. 

Treatment may include radical nephrectomy, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy (for palliation). At the time of this evaluation, this patient was still undergoing evaluation for treatment. However based on the images provided, there is extrarenal involvement without venous invasion or nodal metastasis placing this patient’s disease at least at Stage II (50% 5-year survival).  

This is a good example of how a nuclear medicine Tc-99m bone scan used in search of spinal disease can stimulate the discovery of a primary malignancy (likely accounting for this patient’s symptoms) and prompt appropriate treatment. Any renal asymmetry, whether in size, shape or degree of uptake on Tc-99m bone scan must not be overlooked and should ALWAYS prompt further clinical and/or imaging evaluation. 

While renal assymetry on Tc-99m bone scan can prompt the discovery of primary renal cell carcinoma, it is not a suggested means of evaluating for renal cell metastasis. Bone scan evaluation for metastasis is ideal for osteoblastic rather than osteolytic (RCC) lesions. While some osteolytic lesions are noted on bone scan, sensitivity is in the neighborhood of 50%.
