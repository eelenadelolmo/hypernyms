26 year-old man with increasing right-sided parietal and occipital headaches
Spetzler-Martin grade 4 arteriovenous malformation within the right occipital lobe that extends into the right posterior aspect of the parietal lobe. There is evidence of surrounding edematous changes which may suggest impairment of venous drainage. Arterial supply is predominantly from the right PCA. There is also supply from the posterior division of the right MCA as well as minimal supply from the right ACA. There is a large associated venous varix which drains to the posterior superior sagittal sinus.
