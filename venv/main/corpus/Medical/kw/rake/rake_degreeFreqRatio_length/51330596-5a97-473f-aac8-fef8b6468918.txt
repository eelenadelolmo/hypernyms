Vital Signs:  Blood pressure is 111/80, pulse is 76, weight is 141 pounds, height is 5 feet 2inches, and BMI is 26. 
 
Appearance: She appears in no acute distress.  She appears older than her chronological age.  
HEENT:  Normal.  
Neck:  No JVD, no carotid bruits.  
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  
Heart:  S1 and S2, regular rhythm, no gallops, no murmurs.  
Abdomen:  Soft, mildly obese, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  No clubbing, no cyanosis.  No brachiofemoral delay.

Cardiac Enzymes were normal.

EKG was interpeted to indicate probable right ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormality.
A clear history of a typical angina could not be elucidated.  Symptoms were suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea and GERD with esophagitis.  What made the situation more complex was that she did have minor EKG changes.  There was no evidence of either the left main or the left coronary system producing ischemia. Based on this information, recommendations included the following:

1. Metoprolol to 150 mg twice a day, thus controlling her heart rate to prevent further chest pain or any silent ischemia.

2. Ordered a sleep study to rule out obstructive sleep apnea.

3. Patient was sent to gastroenterology to address her heartburn sensation.  The results showed a normal esophagus with nonbleeding erosive gastropathy. 

4. Consultation with a cardiac surgeon led to the decision not to perform surgery, since the left main coronary artery followed a retroaortic route.

5. Advised the patient to quit smoking.

6. Ordered a stress Echo in order to ascertain the degree of ischemia that may be present. The stress Echo was suboptimal due to an adequate maximum heart rate not being achieved due to fatigue. The results obtained were limited but normal.
1. Left main coronary artery arising from the right coronary cusp. The anomalous left main courses posteriorly between the aorta and left atrium. A separate anomalous artery arises from the right coronary cusp and courses between the aorta and pulmonary outflow tract to supply a portion of the basal septum.

2. Mild soft plaque present in the distal RCA resulting in 10 to 25% luminal narrowing.

3. Coronary calcium score: 0
Anomalous Left Main Coronary Artery and Interarterial Vessel
Possible Ischemia due to interarterial vessel.

GERD to account for symptoms since ischemia due to small interarterial branch seems unlikely.

See Followup.
This 51 y.o. woman presents with periodic episodes of sub-sternal chest pain and discomfort for the last six to seven years.  The discomfort was regularly accompanied by regurgitation with a bitter taste in the back of her throat. She also had a five year history of persistent fatigue and daily tiredness. She described the discomfort as a heartburn sensation that radiated to her neck and she took Tums and multiple other medications over time before eventually deciding to go to the ER. 

During examination she mentioned there was some dyspnea when she over-exercised. She also had been smoking for more than 20 years, half a pack a day. She denied syncope or pre-syncope.  

Past Medical History:  Depression and anxiety (severe), TIAs (two within the last year), and memory loss over one year.

Past Surgical History:  Hysterectomy in 2007 and two kidney stone surgeries.

Family History:  Father is 76 years old with heart disease.  Mother is 75 years of age and healthy.  She has one brother and that is 54 years of age and is healthy.

Allergies: Morphine

EKG and Cardiac CT Angiogram were performed to assess for abnormal heart function and coronary artery disease.

Medications:
1. Aspirin 81 mg once a day.
2. Metoprolol 100 mg twice a day.
3. Cyclobenzaprine 10 mg t.i.d.
4. Xanax 0.5 mg b.i.d.
5. Amitriptyline 25 mg once a day.
6. Gabapentin 800 mg x4.
7. Pravastatin 20 mg once a day.
8. Diclofenac 75 mg b.i.d.
What made the situation more complex was that she did have minor EKG changes.  It is possible that the small branch that courses between the aorta and the right ventricular outflow tract may have led to ischemia in the septum, but no evidence of this could be ascertained.
