PSA levels:  Increasing levels of PSA from 15.81 to 96.91 during a six month period of time
-Analgesics for treatment of bone pain
-Antineoplastic therapy with androgen deprivation.

Multiple sclerotic lesions involving the vertebrae and the iliac bones consistent with metastases from prostate cancer
Bone metastasis from prostate cancer.
Bone metastases most commonly from prostate
Sclerotic Paget's- less likely
Infection, such as tuberculosis, unusual without joint space involvement
Patient is a 60 y/o WM with history of prostate CA, s/p radical prostatectomy with regional lymph node resection.  Patient subsequently underwent 2 courses of chemotherapy treatments with response.  With 3 months the patient developed bone metastases from his prostatic carcinoma. He is currently enrolled in a trial therapy, which requires interval follow-up diagnostic imaging study to evaluate response to therapy.
Metastatic prostate cancer is usually spread hematogenously;. Metastases to bone are the most common metastasis with prostate cancer.  The proposed hypothesis for this pattern of spread of metastasis is retrograde spread to the axial skeleton (pelvis and vertebrae) via Batsonâ€™s venous plexus, which is a valveless venous plexus of the spine and paraspinal region with communication between the pelvic and vertebral venous systems, femoral and iliac veins, inferior and superior vena cava, and other veins. This system may be important for hematogenous spread of either metastases or of microorganisms in spinal infection.  Prostatic metastases are usually osteoblastic as shown on radiographs and on CT images. However, scintigraphy (bone scans) are useful for detecting early metastases several weeks or months before the radiographs become abnormal.   
 
The increase in public awareness of prostate cancer and in the use of PSA to screen for the disease has led to early diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.Prior to 1991, greater than 30% of patients developed distant metastases Currently approximately 6% have metastases.
