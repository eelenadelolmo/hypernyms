On initial evaluation the patient was alert and interactive with vital signs stable and within normal limits.  The neck was noted to be erythematous and edematous extending from the left supraclavicular region up to the mandibular angle and down to the upper lateral chest.  There was significant swelling along the left sternocleidomastoid muscle with a tender well-demarcated 2x2 cm mass along the anterior border.  The exam was otherwise unremarkable with exception for a recently extracted left anterior tooth with healing gingival mucosa.
The patient was treated with a two week course of outpatient I.V. Vancomycin without much improvement.  He subsequently received a three month course of Penicillin and Probenecid resulting in resolution of the left neck erythema and discomfort.  He proceeded to surgery for laryngoscopy with Tisseel injection of branchial cleft sinus tract to close the sinus tract.

The patient received a post-operative repeat Barium Swallow with Esophagram showing a short tract remaining from the pyriform sinus that cleared rapidly with swallowing.  The patient was asymptomatic and told to follow-up with his primary care physician if symptoms re-emerge.
Initial CT scan if the soft tissues of the neck showed significant swelling of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle with air bubbles in the a sinus tract originating from the left pyriform sinus consistent with a branchial cleft anomaly.  

A subsequent barium esophagram confirmed a fistula which extends from the left inferior pyriform sinus that cleared rapidly with swallowing.  A post-operative barium esophagram showed a small residual sinus tract.
Fourth Branchial Cleft Sinus Tract, Polymicrobial Infection
• Left lateral neck Abscess
• Cellulitis
• Laryngocele
• Cystic Hygroma
• Branchial Cleft Cyst
• Thymic Cyst
• Glandular Cysts
• Lymphadenitis
• Lymphangioma
• Thyroid Mass
• Dermoid Tumor 
• Thyroglossal Duct Cyst
• Branchial Cleft Cyst
This 15 year old boy, no past medical history, initially presented with recurrent swelling of the left neck associated with minimal discomfort one week after a left mandibular tooth extraction.  He denied fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, dysphagia, odynophagia, vomiting or diarrhea.
This patient presented with a common manifestation of a rare branchial cleft anomaly.  Fourth branchial cleft sinus tracts commonly present left lateral neck infections as in our patient.  Early detection and aggressive treatment was instituted given the high level of suspicion for a fourth cleft defect.  This early and aggressive treatment prevented development of supprative thyroditis which commonly occurs in patients with fourth cleft sinus tracts.  The source of infection was likely from extraction of a left mandibular baby tooth approximately one week prior to the onset of the neck infection allowing inoculation of oropharyngeal organisms into the tract.    The primary care physician started the patient on a two week course of I.V. Vancomycin after a biopsy suggested a polymicrobial cellulitis originating from a supraclavicular mass suspected to be a branchial cleft remnant.
