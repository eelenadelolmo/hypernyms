Papillary carcinoma commonly occurs in patients during the seventh decade.  The patient described here was only 35 years old.  Being a radiographer by occupation it is possible that exposure to excessive dose of radiation may have occurred due to his profession.  Extension of the lesion caused the left vocal cord paralysis.
