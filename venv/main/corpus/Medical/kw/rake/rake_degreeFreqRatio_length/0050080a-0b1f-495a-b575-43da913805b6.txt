There are areas of relative fixation and lack of dilatation in the 2nd and 3rd portion of the duodenum.  The 3rd portion of duodenum shows constriction.  The terminal ileum is seen to be fixated and narrowed with increased separation of loops, consistent with an inflammatory process. The adjacent cecum also showed increased thickening and nodularity of the 
folds also suggesting an inflammatory process.
