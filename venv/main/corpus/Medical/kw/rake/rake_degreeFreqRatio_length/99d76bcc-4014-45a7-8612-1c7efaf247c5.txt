Texto: 
Lack of breath sounds over lower right lung.
Surgical resection
CXR: Large right lower lung mass.

CT: A large mixed cystic and solid mass is present at the base of the right lung that has a large feeding vessel coming from the arota.  Not shown was a vein leaving this mass and draining into the IVC.
Pulmonary Sequestration
Extralobar sequestration
Intralobar sequestration
CCAM (congential cystic adenomatoid malformation)
Hamartoma
Pneumonia
A 4 day old infant with a lung abnormality seen on a prenatal US.
Increasingly, congenital pulmonary malformations are diagnosed by prenatal sonography and/or magnetic resonance imaging.  It can be very difficult by imaging to differentiate the type of congenital pulmonary malformation, but if it persists into postnatal life, then surgical consultation is advised.
