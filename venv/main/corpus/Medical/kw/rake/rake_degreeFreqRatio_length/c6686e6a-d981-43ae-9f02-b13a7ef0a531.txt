• Lipoma in right sylvian fissure
• Associated dilated perivascular space
Intracranial lipoma
none

It is of interest that the lipoma is not in the midline.  The dilated perivascular space is also unusual in that it is ipsilateral to the lipoma.
Neither of these lesions is likely to be of clinical significance.
