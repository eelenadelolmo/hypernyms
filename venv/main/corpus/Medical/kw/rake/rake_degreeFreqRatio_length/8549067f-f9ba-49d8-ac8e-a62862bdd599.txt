Unremarkable Clinical Exam per report.
Initial mammographic images were unremarkable. Initial ultrasound showed a small circumscribed hypoechoic lesion with hyperechoic center, thought to be a intramammary lymph node. Follow up imaging six months later demonstrated a circumscribed high denisty mass in the inferior right breast. Ultrasound at followup diagnostic mammogram showed a spiculated heterogenous predominantly hypoechoic mass with internal vascularity.
Poorly Differentiated Invasive Ductal Cell Carcinoma
Carcinoma.
Atypical fibroadenoma or any benign etiology very unlikely.
Palpable Breast mass in the inferior right breast.
