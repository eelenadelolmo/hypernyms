Nystagmus
Ataxia
Visual field defects consistent with cortical lesion blindness.
Anticoagulant therapy
Physical therapy.
CT - Initial CT shows Right occipital lobe low-attenuation
MR - Bilateral occipital lobe lesions (much more prominent on Right) and right lateral cerebellar lesion
CTA - Defect in V3 portion of right vertebral artery  consistent with dissection.

Follow up CTA 3 months later reveals smaller V3 segment vertebral artery lesion, but complete occlusion of the intradural right vertebral artery.
Vertebral Artery Dissection with Cerebellar Infarction
Vertebral artery dissection
Cerebellar ischemic infarction
Bilateral occipital lobe ischemia
13 y.o. boy sudden onset of nausea, headache, and gait problems.  He plays football but there is no definite history of head or neck injury reported.
Vertebral artery dissection does not require major trauma, and may occur in the setting of seemingly mild neck motions - especially combinations of rotation and extention.
