She was treated with IV  Recophin (Ceftriaxone). She has improved, but continues to have mild weakness in the upper arm; and, some difficulty in recognizing persons seen.
The second MRI scan T1 images after Gd injection  shows gyral enhancement over the  temporal and parietal lobes, as well as pia-arachnoid enhancement about the cerebellum.   The involvement of  different vascular territories,   makes a vascular etiology less likely, leaving an inflammatory etiology to be the most likely cause.
Acute bacterial meningitis
• Multiple embolic Infarcts
• Cerebral thrombophlebitis
• Meningo-encephalitis
