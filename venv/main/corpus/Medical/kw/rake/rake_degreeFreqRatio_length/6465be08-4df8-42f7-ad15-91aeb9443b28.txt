Spondylolisthesis
19 year old man who fell off the roof and fractured his right tibia and fibula. CT of the spine was ordered in spite of the lack of any back pain or neurologic deficit.  According to his ER note, he was "intoxicated and on the roof messing around with his buddy."
L3 is an uncommon site for pars defects.  They are much more frequently located at the L4 and L5 vertebral levels.
