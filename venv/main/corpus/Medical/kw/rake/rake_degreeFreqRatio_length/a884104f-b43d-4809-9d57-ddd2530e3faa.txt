Mass was resected
MR images demonstrate a lobular, well circumscribed mass in the oropharynx which is T1 iso, T2 hyperintense with avid enhancement post gadolinium. The mass has benign features with no evidence of mucosal extension.

19 year old pregnant female with gurgling senstation and some difficulty swallowing.
Schwannomas are benign, encapsulated tumors that occur in the head and neck region up to 50% of the time. They can often occur in the parapharyngeal space, but there are only a few scattered case reports of intrapharyngeal schwanommas. They  often become symptomatic due to their size and mass effect on surrounding structures as in this case.
