19 year old pregnant female with gurgling senstation and some difficulty swallowing.
Schwannomas are benign, encapsulated tumors that occur in the head and neck region up to 50% of the time. They can often occur in the parapharyngeal space, but there are only a few scattered case reports of intrapharyngeal schwanommas. They  often become symptomatic due to their size and mass effect on surrounding structures as in this case.
