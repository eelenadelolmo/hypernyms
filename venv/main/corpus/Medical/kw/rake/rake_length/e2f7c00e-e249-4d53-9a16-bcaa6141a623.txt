Multiple skin biopsies diagnosed as Basal Cell Carcinoma
Excision of suspicious lesions and limited exposure to U.V. and ionizing radiation.
Hands:   Multiple well circumscribed elongated (flame shaped) cortical lucencies throughout both hands. Nondisplaced fracture at the base of the right second proximal phalanx.
Foot:  Healed fractures of the second/third metatarsals. Multiple lucencies of hindfoot and distal tibia/fibula. 
Bone Scan: Multiple areas of focal increased and decreased uptake. Increased uptake along the falx cerebri. 
Head CT: Calcifications along the falx and tentorium.
Gorlin Syndrome
Differential Diagnosis of Multiple Lytic Lesions: Fibrous Dysplasia, Metastases, Myeloma, Osteoporosis, Disseminated Osteomyelitis, Hyperparathyroidism, Gorlin Syndrome.
51 yo female injured right index finger.

Review of prior studies and labs revealed diagnosis.
