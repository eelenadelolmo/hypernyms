Metaphyseal cupping, fraying and irregularity at sites of rapid growth, including anterior ribs, long bones of the lower extremities and the wrists
Rickets
Renal disease: 
-renal osteodystrophy (most common cause) 
-renal tubular disorders: vitamin D-resistant rickets 
cystinosis and X-linked hypophosphatemia. 
Vitamin D deficiency: dietary lack (rare in U.S.), malabsorption. 
Hepatocellular and biliary disease. 
Anticonvulsant drug therapy: Dilantin, Phenobarbitol. 
Tumor-associated rickets: associated neoplasms are in bone or 
soft tissue. Most frequently hemangiopericytoma. Other lesions include nonossifying fibroma, giant cell tumor, osteoblastoma.
1 YEAR OLD FEMALE WHO PRESENTED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WITH COMPLAINT OF COUGH AND FEVER.  INCIDENTAL FINDING OF DIFFUSE BILATERAL COSTOCHONDRAL CUPPING ON CHEST FILM LEAD TO FURTHER WORK UP.
