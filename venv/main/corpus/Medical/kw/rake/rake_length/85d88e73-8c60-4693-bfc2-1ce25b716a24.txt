Physical exam: Left hip with minimal internal and external rotation, flexion limited to 80 degrees with full extension.
50% of these patients at age 50-60 years of age will develop degenerative arthritis. Modifications of activity and NSAIDS for this patient is appropriate.
Coxa magna femoral head. Incongruency of the acetabulum and femoral head and significant arthritic femoral head and acetabulum. Prominent acetabular shelf.
Legg-Calve-Perthes
Avascular necrosis, Septic Arthritis, transient synovitis, proximal femoral osteomyelitis, SCFE, and hip dysplasia. One must rule out infectious etiology with history, ESR and C-reactive protein. SCFE can be identified on radiographs and transient synovitis improves with anti-inflammatory medications and resolves in 4 weeks (11)
For a child with a trendelenberg gait: Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, developmental dysplasia of the hip, SCFE, muscular dystrophy, hemiplegic palsy (2).
22 year old active duty male infantry officer and West Point Grad, presents to orthopedic clinic with atraumic left hip pain. Pt has recently completed infantry officer basic course but with significant pain. Pt has had left hip pain since he was 11 years old.
