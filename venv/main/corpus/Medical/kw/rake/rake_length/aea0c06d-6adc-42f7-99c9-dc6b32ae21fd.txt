Obstipation, abdominal pain, abdominal distention.  Labs pending at time of imaging.
Initial stabilization of patient with decompression, followed by elective sigmoidectomy.
Frontal radiographs of the abdomen show air within a distended loop of large bowel at the left upper quadrant.  The cecum and ascending colon are seen in the expected location and are decompressed, containing only a small amount of gas.  Spot images from a low pressure barium enema show abrupt tapering of the contrast column at the level of the distal sigmoid colon (the so-called “beaked” appearance typical of sigmoid volvulus).
Sigmoid volvulus
Sigmoid volvulus
Distal large bowel mechanical obstruction, neoplasm should be excluded
The patient is a 51 y/o female with obstipation and abdominal pain and distention.
