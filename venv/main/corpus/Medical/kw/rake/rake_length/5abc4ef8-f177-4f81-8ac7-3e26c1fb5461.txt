Ultrasound images demonstrate tethered spinal cord with echogenic mass at the level of the S2 vertebrae, likely a lipoma.  No communication with skin surface.

MRI reveals the conus medullaris at the level of S2.  A lipoma is present at the termination of the spinal cord.  A small dysraphic defect is seen at the posteroinferior sacrum with the lipoma extending through it.
