Left lower extremity leg pain.  Ambulates with a slight limp.
Anterior and lateral radiographs demonstrate a non-displaced faint oblique lucency in the mid to distal diaphysis.  Periosteal reaction and sclerosis along the fracture line are consistent with healing.
Toddler's Fracture - likely 7 - 14 days old given evidence of healing.
Stress fracture
Longitudinal tibia fracture
Toddler's fracture
3 year old female with left lower extremity leg pain for 2 weeks.  No history of trauma.
Toddler fracture was first described by Dunbar et all in 1964.  It is a spiral, hair line fracture that is often not vizualized radiographically initially.  Sometimes, it can only be viewed in one veiw.  It behaves like a stress fracture and presents with normal or subtle findings.  Often the fracture is confirmed by placing the suspected limb under a torque stress.  If pain is present, the diagnosis is clarified.
