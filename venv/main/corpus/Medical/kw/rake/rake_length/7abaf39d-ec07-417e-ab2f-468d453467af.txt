Engorgement of the left pampiniform plexus, the vermiform structure posterior to the testis surrounding the spermatic cord and epididymis.
The left gonadal venous plexus was embolized with platinum coils.
Ultrasound images of the left scrotum demonstrate enlarged veins that increase in size even more with valsalva.
Two images from venogram show gonadal vein pre and post coiling.
Varicocele
Differential diagnosis for male infertility is myriad and is not a subject that a radiologist dare delve into.  Just to get an impression of how complex it is take a look at this web page:

19 year old male presents with a 3 year history of left scrotal fullness.  It has been most bothersome during intercourse and running.   He and his wife have not been able to conceive after one year.
In this particular case, diminution of the size of the varicocele was acheived with a minimun number of coils.  However, in cases where numerous dilated incompetent veins are draining the varicocele, the total cost of the coils used can be astounding.  Surgical therapy remains a very reasonable and cost effective alternative to embolization.
