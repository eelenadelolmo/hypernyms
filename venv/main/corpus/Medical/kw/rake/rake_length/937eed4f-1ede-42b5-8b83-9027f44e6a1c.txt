52 y/o  man fell off a truck and now presents with left sided chest wall pain.
This patient presented for rib pain secondary to trauma and a left lung mass (solitary pulmonary nodule) was discovered incidentally on CXR and followed up with additional studies to include PET and definitive surgical removal.  He has a history of basal cell carcinoma but no known history of melanoma.  Physical exam showed no evidence of a primary melanoma.
