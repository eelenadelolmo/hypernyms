Phyical exam showed: Clear rhinorhea, bilaterally
Lab values of interest: positive Beta-2 microglobulin = 2.20 MG/L (normal 0-1.85) (This is a marker for CSF in nasal, aural or other discharge).


Prior to the intrathecal injection of Indium-111 DTPA, the patient had three pledgets placed by the ENT service in her superior meatus, middle meatus, and inferior meatus bilaterally.

The pledgets showed absorption of radiotracer bilaterally. Higher counts were seen on the left with the left superior meatus showing the single greatest area of activity with a net pledge 10 minute-count number of 40,264.

The patient’s net plasma count was 2734.  
The net counts per gm / net counts 1 of  ml plasma = 49.0 for the superior left meatus, 35.2 for the middle left meatus, 33.3 for the inferior left meatus, 8.5 for the superior right meatus,	5.4 for the middle right meatus, and 4.9 for the inferior right meatus. The normal ratio was calculated at = 1.3.
This patients is still in the care of the ENT service and the cause of her CSF leak is still indeterminant.
- After a lumbar puncture and injection of Indium-111 DTPA (0.58mCi / 0.47 ml) the patent was immediately scanned to ensure the injection was intrathecal; this is seen as a vertical column of tracer activity seen in the forth image.

A second series of images was obtained at 4 hrs (top remaining 5 images)which showed normal flow of the radiotracer through the spinal column and around the convexities as expected, with an abnormal collection of radiotracer seen anterior and inferior to the expected location CFS.

A third series of images (bottom 5 images) was obtained at 24 hrs which again showed radiotracer had accumulated in the expected areas of the anterior nasal sinuses and meatus bilaterally.
CSF LEAK
- This patient is a 47 year old female who presented to the ENT service complaining of clear left rhinorrhea. She had no other complaints and denied any recent trauma or surgery.
This patient was shown to have a very positive cisternography / CSF leak study by the absolute radiotracer count seen in the area of the nasal airways and by the nasal-to-plasma radiotracter ratio.

The radiotracer count was highest in the pleget placed in the left superior meatus, and the visualized radiotracer activity was also most appearent in this location making this the most likely area of actual CSF leak.
