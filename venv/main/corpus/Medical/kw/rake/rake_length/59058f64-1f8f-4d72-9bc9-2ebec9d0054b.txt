On initial presentation, the patient was happy and engaged, in no distress.  His height was at the 60th percentile, and his weight was at the 97th percentile.  Head circumference was 55.8 cm, 4+ SD above normal.  Facies showed frontal bossing and mildly course facial features.  Lungs were clear, no murmurs noted, liver edge felt 4cm below R costal margin.   Musculoskeletal exam revealed mild limitation of pronation and supination of the arms.
He began weekly infusions of Elaprase.  During his 6th infusion, he developed urticaria over his face, back and legs.  Elaprase was continued, weekly, with IV Benadryl as a pretreatment.  Monthly complete metabolic panels and complete blood counts with differential are obtained as well.     

A mutation was discovered in the IDS gene and it was determined that this was a new mutational event in the patient as his mother is not a carrier.               

After his diagnosis was received, an MRI of the head and flexion-extension films of the spine were performed.  MRI showed a thin corpus callosum, areas of cystic change in the superior medial margins of the lateral ventricles, a mega cisterna magna, and abnormal T2 uptake.  Cervical spine flexion-extension films were normal.  His hearing and vision were assessed.  No corneal clouding was noted.  An echocardiogram was completed, which showed an abnormal mitral valve with mild mitral valve insufficiency.  A port was placed for enzyme infusions of Elaprase (idursulfase).  Additionally, annual flu vaccines and a pneumococcal vaccine were recommended.
The abdominal ultrasound showed hepatosplenomegaly (13.3cm, UL 10.5cm) and splenomegaly (9.8cms, UL 9cms).  The skeletal survey showed a J shaped sella, short and wide long bones, anterior beaking of the L1 vertebral body, and widened metacarpals with inferior pointing.  The cranial MRI showed areas of cystic change in the superior medial margins of the lateral ventricles and a thin corpus callosum.
Hunter Syndrome
1.	MPS 1 (Hurler syndrome)
2.	MPS 2  (Hunter syndrome)
3.	MPS 6 (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome)
4.	MPS 7 (Sly syndrome) 
5.	Multiple sulfatase deficiency
The patient was referred to genetics clinic because of concern for a mucopolysaccharide disorder.  His aunt had a son with Hurler syndrome and noted that the patient had a similar facies.  Past medical history is significant for two episodes of otitis media and upper airway congestion.  Surgical history is significant for adenoidectomy and bilateral pressure equalizer tube placement on three separate occasions.
