Vitals:  Temp 37.1, HR 83, BP 145/92, RR 18
There was marked proptosis of the left eye with associated superior lid swelling.  The left orbit was slightly tender to palpation.  

Cranial nerves II-XII were grossly intact.
The patient underwent stealth-assisted endoscopic sinus surgery.  The mucocele was drained and he experienced immediate improvement in his diplopia post-operatively.
» CT: There is a round, homogenous mass centered within the left frontal sinus that is isodense to soft tissue.  The mass is expanding the left frontal sinus and eroding anteriorly through the frontal bone.  There is proptosis and inferolateral displacement of the left globe by the mass.  The mass does not extend intracranially.

» MR: The mass is hyperintense on T1 and isointense on T2.  There is no evidence of enhancement within the mass.  Again seen is the erosion through the left frontal bone and mass effect causing proptosis and inferolateral displacement of the left globe.  There is no signal abnormality within the optic nerve.
Frontal sinus mucocele
• Mucocele
• Sinonasal neoplasm
• Allergic fungal sinusitis
• Sinonasal polyposis
A 50  y.o.  man presents with a 6 month history of diplopia, left proptosis, and intermittent swelling of his face.  He denies any headaches, facial pain, or nasal discharge.
