Patient was febrile on presentation and  had an elevated white count (14.3). Portable chest plain film shows a well-placed ET tube and bilateral patchy opacities.  She is admitted to the ICU.  The next day she fails vent weaning and continues to spike fevers.  Her WBC’s have also bumped to approximately (17.3). A chest CT is obtained.
Patient improved clinically with antibiotics and was successfully weaned from vent.
CT of the chest w/o contrast shows bilateral pleural effusions with  right greater than left and adjacent atelectasis. There are multiple rounded pulmonary nodules in both lungs predominant in the right with focal cavitations. There is also diffuse groundglass opacity and septal thickening in the left upper lobe extending into the left lower lobe. The nodules in the left lung are predominantly in the peripheral left lower lobe. 
Mildly enlarged mediastinal nodes measuring up to 1.5 cm in short axis are likely reactive.  No pericardial effusion. The central airways are patent. Endotracheal tube terminates in the midtrachea. Gastric and feeding tubes extend into the stomach. The visualized upper abdomen is without significant abnormalities. No aggressive bone lesions.
Septic Pulmonary Embolism
(1) Septic Pulmonary Embolism
(2) Wegener’s granulomatosis 
(3) Fungal infection
(4) Tuberculosis
(5) Metastases
Patient is a 53-year-old white female who was found down with altered mental status and is a possible TCA overdose.  She was found to be in respiratory distress by EMS and was intubated in the field.

Pt has a personal history significant for opioid drug abuse and depression.  Family history is significant for diabetes and coronary artery disease.
This patient presented with fever and respiratory difficulty.  Her history, obtained from family members, and chest x-ray were non-specific and allowed for a broad differential.  The cavitary nodules seen on chest CT narrowed the differential.
