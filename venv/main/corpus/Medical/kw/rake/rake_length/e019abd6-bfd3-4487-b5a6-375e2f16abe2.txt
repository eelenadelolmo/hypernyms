Afebrile. BP - 96/50, HR 90, RR 22.
ABDOMEN - Tense. + bowel sounds. 

PERTINENT LABS:
Cr - 2.0 mg/dl
Gradually function returns within 7-10 days in the majority of cases.
1) 10/4/2005 CT ABD/PELVIS WITH CONTRAST - Marked ascites. Floating small bowel loops are tethered by the root of the mesentery. The kidneys demonstrate symmetric cortical enhancement. 
2) 10/6/2005 CT ABD/PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST IMAGE 1 - Marked ascites, unchanged. Floating small bowel loops are tethered by the root of the mesentery. The kidneys demonstrate persistent symmetric cortical enhancement. There is evidence of delayed excretion into the renal pelves bilaterally. 
3) 10/6/2005 CT ABD/PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST IMAGE 2 -There is vicarious excretion of contrast via the gallbladder. 
4) 10/6/2005 CT ABD/PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST IMAGE 3 -Increasing anasarca.
CONTRAST-INDUCED NEPHROPATHY
PERSISTENT NEPHROGRAM DIFFERENTIAL:
PRE-RENAL (15%) = 
> Renal artery stenosis
> Hypotension
RENAL (70%) = 
> Glomerulonephritis
> ATN*
> Papillary necrosis
> Renal vein thrombosis
> Acute interstitial nephritis
POST-RENAL (15%) = 
> Obstruction

* Contrast-induced nephropathy
74 year old female with endometrial cancer presented to the hospital with abdominal distention and pain 48 hours ago. She had a contrast-enhanced CT ABD/PELVIS. Now with new anuria. Another CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS requested.
Though 48 hours out from first scan/contrast bolus, second scan done without contrast given acute decline in renal function (inc Cr 2.0). See Factoid.
