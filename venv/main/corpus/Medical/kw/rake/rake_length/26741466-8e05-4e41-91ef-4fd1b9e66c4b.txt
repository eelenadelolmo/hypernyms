Punctate skin dimple in the glabella without edema or erythema.
Resection due to intracranial extension
- Fluorscopy
 Contrast tractography reveals a sinus tract extending from the skin surface to the nasofrontal bone at the midline.  Contrast is seen outlining a central filling defect at the distal aspect of the tract.

- CT
 Osseous defect at the midline nasofrontal interface. 

- MR
 Low T1/High T2 signal nasal dermal sinus at the midline nasofrontal interface with mixed signal mass at the fonticulus frontalis .
Dermoid Cyst, Nasofrontal with remnant tract to skin surface.
Extra-axial/diploic masses.

Nasal Dermal sinus with anterior midline dermoid.
Anterior Cepholocele
Nasal Glioma
Epidermoid
Lipoma
Arachnoid cyst
EG
Presents with skin dimple in the nasofrontal region at the glabella.  Reports occasional bloody discharge.
