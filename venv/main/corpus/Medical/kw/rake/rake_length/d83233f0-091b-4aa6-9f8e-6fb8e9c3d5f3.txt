Examination: 5 mm firm cystic nodule on right nasal ala. No other significant skin findings.
Course: The lesion was excised.
Histopathology: The biopsy shows normal epidermis overlying a proliferation of numerous radiating sebaceous lobules. Small amounts of rudimentary hair structures and apocrine glands are present within the proliferation. The pilosebaceous units are embedded in a mesenchymal stroma composed of fibrous, adipose, vascular and neural tissue. Immunohistochemical stains for S-100 showed staining of numerous stellate, spindle and dendritic cells in the intervening myxoid stroma. Several of these spindle and dendritic cells also stain for factor XIIIA

History: 63 year old African-American female with a 5 month history of right nasal ala lesion. The patient denies pruritis, pain or bleeding, but does admit to occasional drainage. There has been no previous treatments or biopies of the lesion.
