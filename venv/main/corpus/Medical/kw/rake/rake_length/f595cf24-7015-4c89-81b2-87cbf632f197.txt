RUQ tenderness
Mildly elevated white count
Afebrile
Cholecystectomy
Sonographic images demonstrate cholelithiasis, gallbladder wall thickening. Positive sonographic Murphy's sign was present during examination. 
Cholescintigraphic images (HIDA scan) demonstrate nonvisualization of the gallbladder at one hour and also 30 minutes after the injection of morphine.
A scintigraphic rim sign is also present.
Acute cholecystitis
Acute cholecystitis
Acute biliary colic
Chronic cholecystitis
Acute onset of right upper quadrant pain and emesis
Although the sonographic findings were consistent with acute cholecystitis, the referring physician requested the HIDA scan to confirm the diagnosis. The patient's white count was only mildly elevated and he had no fever. In this clinical setting, the consulting surgeon was reluctant to perform an emergent cholecystectomy without further confirmation of the diagnosis with cholescintigraphy. This case demonstrates a particularly nice example of a scintigraphic rim sign. This case also demonstrates how the duodenum may have a shape similar to the gallbladder on the frontal view which may lead to a false negative interpretation. A lateral view will distinguish the two. The gallbladder will be anteriorly located and the duodenum posteriorly located on the lateral view. This patient went to surgery shortly after the HIDA scan and surgery confirmed the diagnosis of acute inflammatory cholecystitis secondary to an obstructing stone.
