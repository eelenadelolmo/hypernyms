Texto: 
The patient was vigorously moving around, moaning, appearing acutely ill and distressed. Pulmonary exam was significant for difficult taking deep breaths. Abdominal exam was notable for generalized tenderness, but without rigidity, rebound tenderness, nor signs of peritoneal irritation.
The patient was managed primarily with conservative treatment. The stone passed overnight uneventfully and the urinoma resolved on its own. The patient experienced complete resolution of symptoms following passage of stone overnight and was discharged.   At his 2 week follow-up , repeat IVP demonstrated no residual leak or outflow obstruction.
Excretory urography revealed delayed nephrogram at 4, 8, and 20 minutes in the left kidney. At the 30 min post injection image, the proximal left ureter was contrast filled with extravasation into area adjacent to the renal pelvis and left ureter.  Subsequent CT scan was notable for perinephric contrast collection at the superior pole of the left kidney the left ureter.  The site of contrast extravasation was clearly identified.  A follow up IVP 2 weeks after conservative treatment with resolution of symptoms reveals symmetrical renal uptake and excretion without extravasation.
Renal Forniceal Rupture
• Renal trauma with hematoma
• Urinary Calculi
• Urinary Tract Infection complicating obstructed ureter
• UPJ obstruction or UVJ obstruction
17 year old boy with no significant past medical history presented with left abdominal pain radiating to his left testicle x 1 day. Family history is significant for kidney stones in his twin brother.
This case highlights the association of urinary calculi with renal forniceal rupture and illustrates the most common treatment, conservative support and care.
