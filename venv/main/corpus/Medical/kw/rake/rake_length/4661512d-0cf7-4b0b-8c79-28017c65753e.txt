Patient will followup in orthopedic clinic for definitive treatment.
Lateral view of the knee on plain radiograph demonstrates an effusion, as well as, a deep lateral femoral notch, also known as the "deep notch" sign, which is suggestive of an anterior cruciate ligament tear.  The normal lateral femoral condylopatellar sulcus is a smooth, faint notch, which should measure no more than 1.2 mm.  The lateral femoral sulcus on this image measures 2.8 mm deep.  

MRI images demonstrate a complete tear of the ACL with a few noncontiguous fibers at the tibial insertion correlating with the plain film findings.  Associated findings included a Grade II medial collateral ligament injury and impaction fracture of the lateral femoral condyle.
Lateral Femoral Notch Sign
A lateral condylopatellar sulcus measuring greater than 1.5mm is abnormal and greater than 2.0 mm is almost 100% specific for an ACL disruption.
Patient is a 20-year old dependent who sustained a left knee injury.  Mechanism of injury was not provided.  The orthopedic surgeon was clinically suspicious for medial collateral ligament and probable anterior cruciate ligament injuries.
In a patient with an ACL tear there may be nonspecific findings of a joint effusion and soft tissue swelling.  In addition, there are several plain film findings which are specific for a ACL injury.  These include a lateral tibial rim fracture (Segond fracture), posterior fracture of the lateral tibial plateau, avulsion fracture of the anterior tibial plateau, and an osteochondral fracture of the lateral femoral condyle manifested by the "deep notch" sign.  

The deep notch sign is a lateral condylopatellar sulcus which measures greater than 1.2 mm deep, and is virtually always associated with an ACL tear.  However, the converse is not true, and in patients with an ACL tear a deep notch sign occurs less than 5% of the time.
