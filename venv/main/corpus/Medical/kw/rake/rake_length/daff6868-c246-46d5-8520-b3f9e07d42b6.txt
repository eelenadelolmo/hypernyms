Slight decreased range of motion when compared to the left side.
A trial of Abduction Bracing could be instituted with close follow up.  Treatment of pain as needed.
Collapse of the right femoral head with mixed lucency and sclerosis within.  There is a developing coxa cagna breva deformity on right compared to the normal left side.
Legg-Calve-Perthes
AVN of Hip:
Legg-Calve-Perthes

4 y/o boy with chronic right hip pain with which is progressively worsening.
With the diagnosis of Legg-Calve-Perthes, approx. 15% can be bilateral.  This patient will then need follow-up not only of the affected side, to follow its progress and remodeling, but to assess the opposite side for any evidence of involvement.  This patient will also have an increased risk of early osteoarthritis secondary to the altered mechanics in the affected hip.
