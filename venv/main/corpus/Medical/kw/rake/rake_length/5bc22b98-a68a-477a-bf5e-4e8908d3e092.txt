Examination: Scalp: erythema with scale. Face: violaceous macules resembling early heliotrope; central facial erythema.
Trunk & extremities: violaceous, indurated plaques. Hands: firm erythematous papules over joints. Fingernails: ragged cuticles and tortuous dilated capillary loops. Neuro: strength 4/5 in upper extremity/shoulder girdle musculature.
Course: The patient's symptoms improved within 3 days of stopping Zocor. Creatinine kinase levels (serial) also declined concurrently with the resolution of the patient's skin findings after stopping Zocor.
Laboratory: ANA negative; anti-RNP, anti-Smith, anti-Ro/La, anti-Jo antibodies negative; Hepatitis panel negative; TSH, 5.90 (slightly elevated); ESR 40 (elevated), Rheumatoid Factor, negative; Creatinine Kinase 2487 (high); LFTs, CBC, Chem 10: normal; Age appropriate cancer screening: negative (PSA, CXR, recent colonoscopy);CT Scan (Neck): 16mm supraclavicular LN on left (FNA: reactive); Fullness at base of tongue (benign per laryngoscopy done by ENT)

Histopathology: The biopsy shows a vacuolar interface dermatitis with increased interstitial mucin.
Case 13 (27th Annual Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, 2003) DERMATOMYOSITIS-LIKE ERUPTION DUE TO ZOCOR
History: 66 y/o Hispanic male with a 5 week history of pruritic erythematous changes to the skin of his upper back, chest, arms, hands, and scalp. The eruption was accompanied by progressively severe myalgias localized to the girdle muscies of the shoulder and upper extremities. The only recent medication change was Zocor (Simvastatin) from 20 mg QD to 40 mg QD.
