Texto: 
Expressive aphasia, right-sided weakness, slight right-sided facial drooping
Labs:
CBC
Platelet count, Bleeding time
PT/PTT
Liver function tests

Imaging:
Angiography of the head

Management:
- ABCs
- Maintain MAP < 110 mm Hg or BP < 160/90
- Treat elevated ICP with analgesia and sedation, osmotic diuretics, CSF drainage. Maintain CPP 60-80 mm Hg.
- Consider seizure prophylaxis
- Maintain normothermia
- Clinical monitoring for neurologic worsening for the initial 24 hours w/ sequential imaging as indicated
- Ventriculostomy and/or surgical evacuation if there is continued deterioration in status or continued expansion of hematoma
There is acute hemorrhage within the left thalamus and basal ganglia measuring up to 3 cm in greatest dimension.  There is extension of this hemorrhage into the third and lateral ventricles.  There is mild midline shift measuring on the order of 2 mm. There is mild heterogeneity of the hemorrhage.  No underlying mass is identified.  No other parenchymal hemorrhage or mass is seen.
