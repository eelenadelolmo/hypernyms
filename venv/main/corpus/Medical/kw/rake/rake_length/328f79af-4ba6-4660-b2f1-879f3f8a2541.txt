Audio: asymmetric right SNHL.
Surgical removal.
Right intracanalicular isointense T1, enhancing mass.
Vestibular Schwannoma
For this lesion, which is intracanalicular, the differential is very limited.

1. Vestibular ('Acoustic') Schwannoma (intracanalicular)

*2. Post-op changes could look similar, however, pt had no prior surgical history.
*3. Meningioma is the 2nd most common CPA mass.  However, this is in the differential for a larger (ie. not completely intracanalicular) acoustic schwannoma.
57 y/o male with asymmetric right SNHL.
The intracanalicular location of this mass limits the differential in a patient who presents with typical symptoms.
Diffential diagnosis for CPA cistern masses:
1. Acoustic schwannoma (75%)
2. Meningioma
3. Epidermoid
4. Other schwannoma (CN V- next most common CN schwannoma)
5. Vertebrobasilar ectasia/aneurysm
6. Neuritis (Bell's)
7. Mets, lymphoma, sarcoid
