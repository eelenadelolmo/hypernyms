Acute films (A):  There is no soft tissue swelling, the films are remarkable in the AP projection for a complete spiral fracture involving the middle and distal thirds of the left tibia. There is approximately a 2mm lateral distraction in the middle third of the tibia. There is no angulation or rotation noted on this view.  The lateral projection also indicates a spiral fracture involving distal and middle tibial shaft.  There is no anterior or posterior angulation at the fracture site.  The proximal and distal tibial epiphyseal growth plate are intact and without evidence of trauma. There is no fibular fracture noted. Films one year post closed reduction (B) indicate a completely healed spiral fracture of the left tibia. The epiphyseal plate are open both proximally and distally.
Toddler's Fracture of Left Tibia
Patient is an active 3yo with an unremarkable past medical history found by parents underneath horizontal gym bar in their basement.	Child was crying, inconsolable, not able to communicate nature of injury.  Incident witnessed by older sibling and described as falling injury from horizontal bar approximately 16 inches. Parent's concern increased as child continued to be inconsolable, complained of left leg and hip pain and was unable to bear weight on left leg. The child was taken to the Emergency Room.
Fractures of the tibia and fibula are the most common injuries of the lower limbs in children.  These fractures vary according to the child's age, mechanism of injury and anatomical location.
     This case is representative of an isolated tibial fracture occurring before the age of 6 and is know as a Toddler's fracture. Tibial shaft and metaphyseal fractures are commonly caused by indirect rotational or twisting forces resulting in an oblique or spiral fracture line.  Direct trauma is often manifest by a transverse or butterfly fracture through the tibia.  Isolated tibial fractures are most frequently produced by falling injuries.  The most common mechanism of injury is an outward rotation of the body while the foot is in fixed position on the ground. Torsional forces produces isolated fractures involving the distal third or at the junction between the middle and distal third. A spiral fracture typically starts distally, ventrally and medial, and finishes proximally, dorsal	and lateral.  Soft tissue deformity is not a common finding in children since frequently the fracture	is not displaced as seen in this case.  Intact fibula and periosteum prevent primary shortening of the tibia.  Neurovascular compromise is infrequent, but should be evaluated in all instances.

Radiographic films of the tibia should include AP & Lateral films.  Incomplete or	spiral fractures are often difficult to visualize in one projection.  When routine views do not show the fracture, an internal rotation oblique film is more likely to reveal the fracture than an external rotation view.  These views may also fail to delineate the fracture line and the fracture line may be seen on films made in the first few days following the acute injury. Occasionally, subperiosteal new bone formation is the only definite	abnormality seen with the fracture line never clearly demonstrated.  Complications of Toddler's fractures are infrequent, but may include nonunion, premature epiphyseal closure, malrotation, leg length discrepancy or compartment syndrome.
