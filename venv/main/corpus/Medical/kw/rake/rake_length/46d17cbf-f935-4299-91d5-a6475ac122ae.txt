Multiple CT images demonstrate difuse, smooth distal colonic thickening from the splenic flexure to the proximal sigmoid colon.  There is surrounding pericolonic inflammation.  There is no pneumatosis or abnormal dilation.
Ischemic colitis
ischemic colitis associated with IMA hypoperfusion.
57 yo female with rectal bleeding and hypotension
Multiple CT images through the abdomen demonstrate symmetric, smooth thickening of the colon from the level of the splenic flexure to the proximal rectum.  The small bowel, ascending-to-mid-transverse colon and distal rectum are spared.  The differential for thickened, nondilated loops of bowel includes ischemia, edema, hemorrhage and infiltrative processes such as lymphoma and amyloidosis.   
Several features of this case are suggestive of ischemic colitis in the distribution of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA).  The clinical history of abrupt onset of lower abdominal pain and rectal bleeding associated with hypotension is classic for IMA hypoperfusion.  The segmental involvement from the Griffith point (transition point from superior mesenteric artery to IMA vascular territories) to the point of Sudeck (transition from (IMA to hypogastric vascular territories) is also characteristic of IMA hypoperfusion.  Other supporting features include symmetric, lobulated colon wall thickening and pericolic edema. 
Features not present in this case but which suggest infarction and impending perforation include intramural gas and portal or mesenteric venous air.
