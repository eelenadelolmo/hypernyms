Thyroid gland approximately 4 times normal size (based upon palpation)with multiple nodules, including a dominant nodule in the middle pole of the right lobe of the gland corresponding in location to the hypofunctioning nodule on the image.

Fine tremor, brisk patellar reflexes
No lid lag or exophthalmos

Free T4- 1.52 (0.71-1.85 ng/dL)
TSH- < 0.08 (0.49-4.67 MCIU/mL)

I-123 RAI Uptakes:  4 Hour- 30% (2-12%)
               24 Hour- 58% (12-30%)
Patient has been scheduled for a thyroidectomy.
24 hour delayed static image of the thyroid gland following the oral administration of 400 uCi I-123.

-Enlarged thyroid gland. Functioning nodules in the upper and lower poles of the right lobe of the thyroid, with two functioning nodules (difficult to differentiate on the provided image) in the region of the middle pole of the left lobe.  There is a large hypofunctioning nodule in the middle pole of the right lobe (also noted as a distinct nodule on ultrasound).  Additionally, the thyroid to background counts ratio is markedly increased.
