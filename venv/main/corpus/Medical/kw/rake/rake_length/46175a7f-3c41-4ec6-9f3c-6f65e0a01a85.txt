Chilaiditi's sign:  no treatment necessary.

Chilaiditi's syndrome:  treatment conservative (bedrest, fluids, NGT decompression, treatment of constipation).  Surgery may be necessary if volvulus or obstruction suspected.
-Old granulomatous disease.

-lucency under the right hemidiaphragm which is contiguous with colon (containing haustra) on the lateral view

-no pneumoperitoneum
Chilaiditi's sign (patient asymptomatic)
1.  Chilaiditi's sign--the air under the right hemidiaphragm is within the colon as demonstrated by visualization of colonic wall and haustra on lateral view.

Potential pitfalls:

2.  Pneumoperitoneum
3.  Sub diaphragmatic fat-omental fat
4.  Curvilinear pulmonary collapse
5.  Subdiaphragmatic abscess
50 y/o female for routine pre-op (GYN) surgery.  Asymptomatic.
Recognition of Chilaiditi's sign is important because its radiographic findings can mimick more significant processes (pneumoperitoneum or sub-diaphragmatic abscess).  These latter diseases won't show the haustral markings of the colonic interposition.  If distinction is still difficult, lateral decubitus views could also demonstrate the mobility of free air. If doubt still remains or if pneumoperitoneum, abscess, other disease process is suspected, CT could be of diagnostic value.
