AP neck:  abnormal density right hemithorax
PA/LAT CXR:  middle mediastinal mass
CT: homogeneously attenuating mass with mass effect on trachea and esophagus
MR: mixed intensity mass
Bronchogenic cyst, Congenital
Middle mediastinal masses, more specifically foregut duplication cysts
1.  bronchogenic cyst
2.  esophageal duplication cyst
3.  neurenteric cyst
26 y/o WM with neck pain after snowboarding fall
The slightly higher average Hounsfield unit on CT and mixed signal intensity on MR suggest highly proteinaceous fluid.
