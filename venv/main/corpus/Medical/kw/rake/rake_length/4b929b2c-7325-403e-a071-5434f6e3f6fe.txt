2 month old baby boy with sudden onset of emesis persisting for one week.
The diagnosis of malrotation is not always clear and thus the subsequent decision to intervene surgically is not always easy. Although some upper GI series are conclusive, frequently the diagnosis requires good clinical judgement and experience. Furthermore, it is not uncommon to discover asymptomatic adults with malrotation on an upper GI series performed for other reasons.
