ESR - 40  (0-15) NML
CRP - NML
Treatment options are limited to NSAIDs.
AP and lateral images of the cervical spine demonstrate loss of the normal cervical lordosis.  Additionally there are syndesmophytes throughout the cervical spine.  The disc spaces are preserved.

Single AP view of the pelvis demonstrates erosive changes of both sacroiliac joints.
Ankylosing Spondylitis
Calcification of the anulus fibrosis is typically only seen in AS and presents as the classic vertically oriented syndesmophytes bridging vertebral levels and creating a "bamboo" appearance to the spine.

While considering the spectrum of spondyloarthropathies, the differential for the cervical spine findings is consistent with ankylosing spondylitis.  The pelvic findings, (i.e. sacroilitis), can be seen in psoriasis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and reiters disease.  The symmetric involvement favors ankylosing spondylitis or inflammatory bowel-related spondyloarthropathy over psoriatic or reiters disease which is classically asymmetric.
44 y/o male with long standing ankylosing spondylitis who presents with marked decrease in range of motion.
In order to separate the manifestations of ankylosing spondylitis in the pelvis versus other causes for sacroilitis one must know the distinguishing features of each disease process as it relateds to the SI joints.  This is summarized below.

Psoriasis/ Reiter's    -   most commonly bilateral, asymmtric

IBD  - bilateral symmetric involvement
