Physical Exam: 	Diffuse, mild thyroid enlargement with a palpable right mid-upper pole nodule. Nontender gland.
Agents:	I-131, 7.43 uCi, PO (Uptake)
	99m-TcO4,  11.0  mCi  IV (Imaging)

24hr RAIU:  0.5 % (Normal 8 - 30%)

No visualized activity / radiotracer accumulation in the thyroid bed, to include the area of palpable abnormality, despite clinical hyperthyroidism.
Subacute painless thyroiditis with transient hyperthyroidism
•Thyrotoxicosis facticia
•Recent significant iodine ingestion (e.g.amiodarone, iodine-containing expectorants, iodine-rich contrast agents)
•Thyroiditis
•Ectopic thyroid hormone production
  -e.g., Struma Ovari.
50 year old woman with clinical hyperthyroidism and known multinodular goiter.
Patient is not in the health field, and denies recent CT scan (with contrast), amiodarone ,other iodine-containing meds, or seafood.  No history to suggest ectopic production.  She has a recent ultrasound exam which revealed multinodular goiter and a dominant left midpolar nodule which was concerning for capsular invasion.  This left sided nodule was not palpable on exam.  The right sided palpable nodule was not specifically characterized on the ultrasound.  

It is impossible on this study to further characterize this nontender, palpable abnormality.  The uptake is markedly decreased.  Taken in total, this patients clinical picture and imaging findings are most consistent with Subacute (painless) Thyroiditis.  The thyroid nodules will require further evaluation.
