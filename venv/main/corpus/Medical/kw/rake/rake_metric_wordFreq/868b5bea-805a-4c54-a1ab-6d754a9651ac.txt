Conservative management.
Sagittal T1 and proton density weighted MR images through the knee demonstrate intermediate signal within the proximal patellar tendon at its origin from the patella.  The fibers are intact.  The T2 image best demonstrates the associated high signal edema within the surroundings Hoffa's fat.
Partial tear of the patellar tendon.
22 year old male with knee pain.
