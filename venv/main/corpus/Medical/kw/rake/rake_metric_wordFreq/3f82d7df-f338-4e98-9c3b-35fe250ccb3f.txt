Mild edema along dorsal aspect of the left foot with tenderness to palpation of the navicular and talar dome areas.  Afebrile.
Cessation of athletic activity for 1-2 months.  Casting is indicated to prevent completion of the fracture, which would possibly require open reduction and internal fixation.  Individuals may return to full activity in approximately 6 months.
Plain radiographs of the left ankle and foot were completed at an outside institution and are unavailable for review.  However, they are normal per report.  Blood pool and delayed images of a Tc-99m MDP bone scan demonstrate focal intense uptake at the left tarsal navicular bone.
