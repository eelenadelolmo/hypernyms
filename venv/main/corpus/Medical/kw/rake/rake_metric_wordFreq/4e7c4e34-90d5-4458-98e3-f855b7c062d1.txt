Ultrasound findings-  classic linguini sign consisting of hyperechoic linear objects coursing through the implant.  Hyperechoic shadowing of all structures, typical of silicon infiltrating into tissues surrounding the implant capsule.

MRI-  Linguini sign with high signal on h20 saturation in the soft tissue surrounding the implant.
Breast implant,  rupture, extracapsular silicone
