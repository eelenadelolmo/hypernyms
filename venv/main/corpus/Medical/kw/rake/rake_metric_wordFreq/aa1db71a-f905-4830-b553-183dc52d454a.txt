CVS/Resp: Decreased lung sounds throughout R lung fields, most notable in the base. RRR, NS1S2.  
Abd: Gastrostomy tube visible, site clean. Bowel sounds present throughout. Anal surgery site clean.
At time of print, patient remains in NICU w/ multisystem support including: 
-ET Tube
-PICC line
-Enteric Tube
CXR DOL 0: Endotracheal tube with distal tip over the top of the carina.  Enteric tube with the distal tip lying over the clavicular heads in the setting of known esophageal atresia.

CT CHEST W/ & W/O CONTRAST DOL 56:
1. R-SIDED AORTA W/ RMSB INTERPOSED BETWEEN THE DESCENDING AORTA AND R PULM ARTERY RESULTING IN CONSOLIDATION AND ATELECTASIS IN R LUNG BASE.
2. DISTAL TRACHEAL ATRESIA AND BRONCHIAL ATRESIA.
3. ESOPHAGEAL ATRESIA W/ BLIND ENDING POUCH ENDING JUST ABOVE THE AORTIC ARCH.
4. LIVER IS ENLARGED W/ LIKELY 2CM ABSCESS IN R HEPATIC LOBE. SPLEEN ENLARGED MEASURING 7.4 CM CRANIOCAUDALLY.
5. MIDLINE FUSION OF INFERIOR POLES SUGGESTIVE OF HORSESHOE KIDNEY.
