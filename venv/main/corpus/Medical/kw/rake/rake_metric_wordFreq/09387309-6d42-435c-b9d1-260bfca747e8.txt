enlarged right testicle, approximately 6 cm.

HCG elevated at 30
Intratesticular mass lesion, well demarcated from normal testicular parenchyma, normal testicular blood flow.

Histology shows a classic type seminoma with mainly heterogeneous cells with large nuclei and prominent nucleoli.  There are scattered multinucleated "giant cell" type syncitiotrophoblast cells, which are the HCG secreting cells.  The presence of these cells does not make this a mixed tumor, but does cause the somewhat unusual hormone pattern.

The second path image shows invasion of the lymphatic system

CT was negative for lymphadenopathy
Seminoma, classic type with scattered syncitiotrophoblast elements
Intratesticular mass, germ cell vs. other.

Hematoma, focal orchitis are possibilities in the right clinical setting, but not in this case with long standing symptoms and no antecedent trauma.
32 yo active duty Sailor presents with 4 month history of increased testicular size and mild discomfort.  No trauma, no significant past medical history, no systemic signs/symptoms
