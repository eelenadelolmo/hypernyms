FINDINGS:  
Orbital images demonstrate asymmetric enlargement of the left inferior rectus
and, to a lesser degree, right inferior rectus and medial rectus muscle bilaterally without evidence of muscular tendon insertion involvement.  
 	Following the administration of gadolinium, there is rather diffuse extraocular muscle enhancement, again to a greater degree involving the inferior and medial rectus muscles, left more than right.  There is no evidence of optic nerve abnormal enhancement or contour distortion.  The intraorbital and extraorbital fat also demonstrates normal signal intensity without evidence of retro-ocular masses or inflammatory changes.
thyroid orbitopathy
DIFF DX: dysthyroid ophthalmopathy, orbital pseudotumor, idiopathic inflammatory orbital myositis, neoplastic infiltration
HISTORY:  MRI-orbits: evaluate for thyroid orbitopathy
