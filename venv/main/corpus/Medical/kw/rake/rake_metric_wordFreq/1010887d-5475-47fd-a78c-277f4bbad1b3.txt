Elevated Rheumatoid factor
Decreased renal function (increased serum creatinine and decreased GFR)
NSAIDs have been the cornerstone of therapy by reducing pain and inflammation and allowing improvements in mobility and function. Typically, the use of NSAIDs alone as single agents in RA should be reserved for mild, well-controlled disease. COX-2 inhibitors may be more effective in controlling inflammation.

There are also many disease-modifying drug regimens present such as methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, gold, d-penicillamine, sulfasalazine, cyclosporine A, minocycline, azathioprine, leflunomide, infliximab, and etanercept.
Plain Radiographs:
Both hands demonstrate bilateral symmetric severe proximal (MCP) joint space destruction with periarticular osteopenia and ulnar subluxation of the 1st and 2nd proximal phalanges on their respective metacarpals.
