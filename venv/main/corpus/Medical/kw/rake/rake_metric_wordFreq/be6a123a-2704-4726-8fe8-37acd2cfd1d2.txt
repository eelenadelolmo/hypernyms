Neurological exam showed absence of brainstem reflexes and no spontaneous respiration on extubation trial.
Termination of life support
There is normal, symmetric radiotracer biodistribution throughout the neck soft tissues, without detectable radiotracer activity in the brain.

Normal tracer distribution within the nasopharnyx
Brain Death
Intoxication
Metabolic derangement
Hypothermia
Head trauma 
Stroke

This differential is for the clinical appearance of brain death, not the scintigraphic images shown.
79 year-old male found unconscious with head CT showing an intra-cranial bleed admitted to the surgical intensive care unit for neurosurgery intervention. Head CT on arrival demonstrated intra-ventricular hemorrhage with evidence of chronic micro vascular ischemic disease. Brain MRI and Cerebral angiogram demonstrated an arterial-venous malformation supplied by the left posterior cerebral artery. After admission, mental functions declined and clinical diagnosis of brain death was declared with request for confirmatory test.
