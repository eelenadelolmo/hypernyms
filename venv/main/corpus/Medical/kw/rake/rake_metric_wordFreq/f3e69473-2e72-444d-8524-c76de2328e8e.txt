No treatment reguired unless becomes symptomatic or bleeds.
The lungs were negative for pulmonary nodule or any acute cardiopulmonary abnormality (CHF was successfully treated prior to scan).  Incidental finding of a well circumscribed, heterogeneous mass seen in the right adrenal fossa.  This  measured   5.0 x 4.0 x 5.5 cm.  There is macroscopic fat (HU= - 50 ) seen through most of this mass with some areas of soft tissue density.  No calcification is identified.  There is a normal left adrenal gland.  Also identified are multiple hepatic cysts demonstrating fluid attenuation (HU= 11  ), imperceptible walls and no lesion enhancement, indicating simple cysts.
