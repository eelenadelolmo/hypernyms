Extratesticular masses:
Adenomatoid tumor 
scrotal hematoma
Lymphoma
Pseudotumor
Scrotal mesothelioma
Sarcoma (Rhabdomyosarcoma)
11 year old male with a left scrotal mass.
While in playing the odds, most extratesticular masses are benign, given the large size and heterogeneity, this doesn't have the appearance of a non-aggressive process.  Since there is internal blood flow, this isn't a hematoma.
