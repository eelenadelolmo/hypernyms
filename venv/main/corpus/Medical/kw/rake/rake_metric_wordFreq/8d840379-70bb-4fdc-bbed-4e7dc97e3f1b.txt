ULTRASOUND IMAGES OF KIDNEY DEMONSTRATE AN ANECHOIC, WELL-DEFINED STRUCTURE WITH IMPERCEPTIBLE WALLS IN AREA OF RENAL SINUS. THERE IS NO ASSOCIATED CALYCEAL DILITATION. THERE IS NO DISTORTION OF CORTICOMEDULLARY JUNCTION. THERE ARE NO STONES. ON COLOR DOPPLER INTERROGATION, THERE IS NO COLOR FLOW TO SUGGEST A VASCULAR LESION. THE URETER DOES NOT APPEAR DILATED.
EXTRARENAL PELVIS
1) HYDRONEPHROSIS
2) PARAPELVIC CYSTS
3) CALYCEAL DIVERTICULA
4) VASCULAR LESION (ANEURYSM, PSEUDOANEURYSM)
5) RENAL CYST (CORTICAL, MEDULLARY, CORTICOMEDULLARY)
77 year old female with history of renal insufficiency.
