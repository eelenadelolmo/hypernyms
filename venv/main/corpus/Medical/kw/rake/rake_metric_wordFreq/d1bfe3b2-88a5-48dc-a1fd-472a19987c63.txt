HR 116/65, P 85, RR 16, T 97.6.  AOx3, equal BS with no rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.  3 cm chest wall wound tracking under subcutaneous tissue inferiorly.  Abdomen is soft, NT, ND.  Midline incision with staples, no erythema, purulence, or tenderness.  LLQ end colostomy with stoma in place.  Less than 1 cm entrance wound on the left buttock with no signs of purulence or erythema.  No neurological deficits noted.
Pt underwent theraputic thoracentesis for pleural effusions.
Chest film: Blunting of CP angles especially on left.  Air bronchograms and atelectatic lungs.  Positive spine sign.

CT: Bilateral pleural effusions with compressive attelectasis L>R.  Multiple prominent axillary lymph nodes are identified meeting pathologic criteria in number but not in size.  A hypodense band is seen in the upper pole of the left kidney representing laceration.  Post surgical changes are noted in the L upper abdomen with 2 metallic clips seen and an absent spleen.  Clip is in the L hemidiaphragm status post diaphragmatic rupture.  Colostomy is seen on left with descending colon attached.  The stomach reveals a thickened and irregular wall with out evidence of a filling defect or focal mass.  Two fluid collections are seen in the pelvis, one in the left hemipelvis anterior to the iliac and the second in the right hemipelvis consistent with hematomas.  Air can be seen in the left gluteus maximus and in the left lateral wall representing bullet tract.  In the bony structures there is a complete fracture through the wing of the left ilia with several bone fragments in the pelvis consistent with the ballistic tract.  A fracture is also noted in the middle portion of the left 5th rib from another bullet.
Bilateral pleural effusions, bilateral pelvic hematomas, fracture/tract of left iliac, Left 5th rib fracture, thickening of gastric wall - non-specific changes, and post surgical changes to left upper quadrent status post splenectomy.
PolyTrauma from multiple ballistics
25 y/o man with 3 GSW to chest, abdomen, and Left buttock.  Pt was resuscitated and had an ex-lap performed before transfer to WRAMC.
This patient illustrates the challenges of caring for patients en-route.  In the United States, many patients with significant trauma are evaluated at a trauma center, resuscitated at that same center and receive definitive care all within one hospital.  In the military this is different as they may pass through many different facilities on their way back to the US for definitive care in a relatively short time.  A complete set of images may not always be available and the Radiologist must try to look at repeat scans to figure out what interventions may have been done prior to the patient’s arrival and what are the remaining complications.  Often the patients may not be aware of what surgeries they have had because they were unconscious and are unable to provide accurate histories.

This is illustrated in trying to follow the even number rule of GSW’s.  For each entrance wound, it is important to see either an exit wound or a bullet.  If we do not see a paired wound or bullet with an entrance wound it is important to keep searching because the bullet may have embolized or we are missing the exit wound.  In patients who have received care en-route it is possible to have a violation of this rule because the bullets may have been removed during previous surgeries at different facilities.

This patient had a repaired diaphragm laceration before reaching our facility which is evidence by 2 clips in the left hemi-diaphragm.  Penetrating diaphragm injuries tend to be smaller (length 1-2cm) and more subtle than blunt diaphragm injuries.  The signs used for detecting blunt diaphragm injury are not as useful in assessing penetrating diaphragm injuries.  One early and specific sign of PDI is herniation of abdominal fat through the injury into the thorax.  If a wound tract is seen on both sides of the diaphragm the specificity of this sign is reportedly 100% (sensitivity 36%).  The diaphragm can also be abnormally thickened when being compared to the contralateral hemidiaphragm due to hematoma, edema, or muscle retraction.  One must have a high index of suspicion when evaluation for penetrating diaphragm injuries.
