Gracile body habitus, no evidence of cyanosis
Right heart failure and pulmonary vascular hypertension can develop as late sequelae of this condition.
Imaging findings on the conventional chest radiograph consist of the anomalous vein draining medially and inferiorly into the inferior vena cava in proximity to the right hemidiaphragm.  The lung fields are equivalent in size.  There is no evidence of vertebral body or rib deformities.  The right margin of the right atria is obscured by the anomalous vein.  The substernal airspace is diminished although this may be due to a normal thymic shadow.  There is mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.
Scimitar syndrome
The plain radiographic appearance in this case pathopneumonic of Scimitar syndrome, a subcatagory of partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, a developmental anomaly usually associated with an atrial septal defect.
9 yo girl with history of atrial septal defect repair.
This patient had a prior ASD repair which prevented right to left shunting an associated hypoxia.  This patient appears not to have the skeletal abnomalities often associated with the right lung hypoplasia often seen in Scimitar syndrome.
