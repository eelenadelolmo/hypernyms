62 y.o. man with a 3 month history of progressive difficulty swallowing solid foods and 2 weeks of dysphagia with both liquids and solids.
This patient&#34;s barium swallow demonstrated a narrow, short segment of tapered distal esophagus with marked dilatation and tortuosity of the esophagus proximally.  These features are most suggestive of primary achalasia.  

Fluoroscopic findings that are associated with secondary achalasia include eccentricity, nodularity, or shouldering at the narrowed distal segment.  In the absence of those findings, in a patient with recent onset dysphagia, distal esophageal narrowing that is longer than 3.5 cm with little or no proximal esophageal dilatation is highly suggestive of secondary achalasia.
