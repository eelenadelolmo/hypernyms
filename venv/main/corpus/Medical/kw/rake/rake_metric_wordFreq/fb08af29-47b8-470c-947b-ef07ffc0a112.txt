Temp: 102.0, otherwise unremarkable physical exam.
   WBC: 19.2K
   UA: Cloudy, (+) blood, (+) leukocyte esterase, WBC: >200 cells/hpf.  
   Urine Culture: (+) E. coli growth.
The patient received 5 days of IV antibiotics during which time his fever resolved and lab values returned to normal.  He was discharged to home with oral antibiotics and will return for outpatient follow-up to include an eventual voiding cystourethogram (VCUG).
Sagittal sonographic images of the kidneys:

The right kidney measures 7.04 cm on the long axis and is normal in shape and architecture without evidence of hydronephrosis.
 
The left kidney measures 10.5 cm on the long axis. Moderate hydronephrosis is demonstrated, as evidenced by enlargement and blunting of the calyces.  Within the pelvis, there is dependently layering homogeneous echogenicity, consistent with infectious debris. The left ureter is not visualized on this examination. No perinephric fluid collections are demonstrated.
Pyonephrosis
Characteristic sonographic appearance.
5 m/o white male with a four day history of fever and fatigue.
Pyonephrosis is a potential complication of pyelonephritis and is used to describe an infected hydronephrotic renal collecting system.  Ultrasonography is the preferred examination in the evaluation of pyelonephritis and may provide information regarding obstruction, stones, or abscess without exposing the patient to radiation.

As a complication of pyelonephritis, the clinical findings of pyonephrosis are similar and include fever, chills, flank pain, and dysuria.  Constitutional symptoms, flank tenderness and abdominal tenderness can also be seen.  In this 5 month old, fever and fatigue were the only apparent findings on presentation.  Urinalysis can show pyuria, bacteriuria, and sometimes microscopic hematuria, as in this patient.  

In most cases of pyelonephritis, empiric therapy is necessary pending culture data or further evaluation for complicating factors.  Generally, if the clinical response is poor after 48 to 72 hours despite appropriate antibiotics, the presence of an intrarenal abscess, perinephric abscess, or obstructive pyonephrosis must be ruled out.  In this case, sonographic interrogation of the kidneys was performed on the day of admission, demonstrating left-sided pyonephrosis and clinical response to antibiotics was rapid.

When severe acute infection is associated with obstruction, percutaneous needle aspiration to make the diagnosis and then to provide a route for percutaneous pyelostomy drainage is the usual approach.  Percutaneous nephrostomy was not performed in this case.

The most common cause of pyelonephritis (and obstructive pyonephrosis) is aerobic gram-negative bacteria (E. coli most often). Gram-positive organisms such as staphylococci and enterococci can rarely cause pyelonephritis.
