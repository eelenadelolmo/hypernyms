PE:
Normal appearing male consistent with stated age, in NAD.  Genitourinary exam shows L scrotal swelling with egg sized L testicular mass palpable, non-tender.  No erythema or warmth seen on scrotal skin.

Labs:
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) elevated: 189 ng/mL
Beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (b-hCG) < 1 IU/L
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) not elevated: 218 U/L
Pt underwent L Radical Orchiectomy, no retroperitoneal lymph nodes were taken at that time.  Patient was evaluated by Oncologist as well.  When results from pathology returned with low grade immature testicular teratoma it was felt that Orchiectomy would likely be curative.  CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis was performed and was found to be negative for any signs of metastatic disease. The patient had follow up with hem/onc at 4 weeks post op.  Will likely not require any further treatment at that time.
Scrotal U/S with Doppler flow:
Findings: The the right testis is identified in the right scrotal sac 
it has a normal appearance. The right testis measures approximately 1.4 x 0.7 x 1.0 cm giving an estimated right testicular volume of 0.5 cc. 
The left scrotal sac is enlarged and is filled with a complex partially 
fluid, partially solid, encapsulated structure. 3.0 x 2.4-2.8 cm. Inside the capsule, complex fluid is present as well as echogenic solid, tissue without evidence of blood flow on color Doppler. This solid appearing tissue is partially calcified. Normal blood flow is demonstrated in the left spermatic cord through the inguinal canal and along the capsule in the scrotum. The left epididymis is not identified. Normal blood flow is demonstrated in each testis with Doppler evaluation. No mass is identified along the spermatic cord. A small left-sided hydrocele is present. The right epididymis has a normal appearance. Normal blood flow is demonstrated in the right testis.

7 m.o. AA male who presented to PCP for painless enlarging L scrotal mass.  Parents of patient are in the military and upon returning from deployment noticed the L scrotal mass.  Patient went for scrotal U/S which showed concern for missed testicular torsion.  Pediatric Urologist was consulted, felt was more likely tumor in origin, pt was also found to have elevated AFP at 189 at that time.
