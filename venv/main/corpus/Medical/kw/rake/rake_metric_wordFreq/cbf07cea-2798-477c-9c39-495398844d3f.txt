Texto: 
T2 slightly hyperintense liver lesion with minimal septal enhancement.  No definitive central scar.  Corresponding to photopenic focus on sulfur colloid liver/spleen scintigram.
photopenic defect on liver/spleen scan of uncertain etiology
1. Focal Nodular Hyperplasia
2. Fibrolamellar HCC
3. Adenoma
4. Regenerating nodule
History of blunt trauma with an incidental liver lesion noted on CT of the abdomen.  Asymptomatic.
The fact that there was no radiotracer uptake in the lesion does not rule out FNH, however it likewise does not rule out any of the other entities in the differential.
