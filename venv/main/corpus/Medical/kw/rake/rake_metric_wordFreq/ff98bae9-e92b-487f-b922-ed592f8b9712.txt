In the neonatal nursery course, this patient failed to pass meconium during the first 48 hours of life.  Rectal biopsy performed at that time demonstrated abundant ganglion cells and the child was discharged with a diagnosis of meconium plug syndrome.

Subsequently, he had multiple presentations to the ED and was admitted when he was noted to be febrile and dehydrated.  His labs showed a normal hemoglobin and hematocrit with elevated white cell count. Blood and stool cultures were negative but he did show a mild metabolic acidosis.  Plain films showed multiple loops of distended large and small bowel suspicious for distal obstruction.  

In addition to the mild metabolic acidosis, the patient had normal sweat chloride.
Approximately one month after presentation the patient underwent a laparoscopically assisted transanal Soave pull-through procedure. The procedure was completed without complication. The patient continued to have difficulty stooling and thus required rectal irrigation and suppositories.  One month later he was taken back to the OR for anal dilation and injection of Botox. Seven months after initial presentation, the patient again presented with symptoms of enterocolitis and constipation.  Anal dilation and Botox injection was repeated.
Plain films of the abdomen demonstrated multiple loops of air filled bowel with air in the rectum.  On decubitus views, air fluid levels were noted.  An initial Barium enema in the NICU demonstrated no definite abnormality, despite a high suspicion for Hirschprungs Disease.

A second barium enema was performed and the diagnosis was felt to be short segment Hirsprungs Disease with a transition point approximately 4 cm above the anal verge.

This 3 month old male presented to the ED with fever of three days duration. He had vomited during that time and been given an enema for suspected constipation.  Urinary output was also decreased.  The mother of the patient noted that he has had difficulty passing stools since birth.  The patient's medications include zantac and tylenol.
This patient was felt to have enterocolitis at this admission, a common complication of Hirshprungs disease.  He completed a course of antibiotics and was begun on colonic irrigation in preparation of colonic resection.
