» "Rock hard" left testicle.

» Lab values -
Alpha-Fetoprotein: 10314 ng/mL 
Beta HCG: 89937 mIU/mL 
LDH: 580 U/L
T2N2M1bS3 	AJCC Stage IIIC (poor risk, but ~70% respond to initial chemo, with 10-15% eligible for salvage therapy).

Screening abdomen and chest studies show dissemination  - but there are no brain metastases.


Orchiectomy with retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, was followed by chemotherapy.
Testicle Ultrasound
• Well-circumscribed, heterogeneously hypoechoic mass with mixed solid and cystic components, arising from the left testicle and confined within the tunica albuginea.

Abdominal CT
• Bulky retroperitoneal and para-aortic lymphadenopathy.  

Chest Film and CT
• Supraclavicular and subcarinal adenopathy and multiple lung nodules.  

All of these findings suggest a metastatic testicular cancer
Mixed Germ Cell Testicular Tumor
• Germ cell tumor (likely non-seminomatous)
• Stromal tumor
• Lymphoma
20 y.o. man with trauma to the groin 4 days ago, presents with increasing pain and swelling of his left testicle for two days.
Lymph node drainage from the testicle follows the path of embryonic develoment back to the renal hilus and para-aortic lymph nodes.  Staging of testicular cancers includes imaging of the abdomen and chest.  Metastatic spread usually follows this cascade: local lymph nodes/veins > renal and para-aortic nodes/veins > lung > system spread.  The lung is usually involved before there can be spread to the CNS - unless there is right-to-left shunt.
