Physical Exam reveals a hard subcutaneous mass located in the right breast at 1200; approximately 5cm from the nipple.
Treatment is currently pending along with Estrogen/Progesterone Receptor assays and HER-2/NEU studies.
Mammogram:  Spiculated, ill-defined density, located midline Craniocaudal view and superior to nipple in Mediolateral view.  BIRADs V.  The images were compared with prior studies from 2001 and 2002 showing a density increased in size and irregularity.  Past workup of following the 2002 mammogram included spot compression vies and ultrasound; however, had the 2001 films been present at that time, biopsy of the new assymetric density would have been more appropriate.
Ultrasound exam of this region demonstrates a 2.8 cm heterogeneously hypoechoic mass with irregular margins and posterior acoustic shadowing.
Invasive Ductal Carcinoma
Differential Diagnosis for these findings in this case:
1.	Invasive ductal carcinoma
2.	Invasive Lobular carcinoma
3.	Phylloides tumor
4.	Metastasis
5.	Benign fibrocystic change
History:  A 56 year old post menopausal female presents to MGMC Mammography with the complaint of a palpable breast mass in her right breast.  The mass has been palpable by the patient for 3-4 weeks.
Last mammogram: 29 August 2002.  Patient underwent spot compression views for an asymmetric density as well as ultrasound at that time; no evidence of malignancy was found and routine annual follow-up was recommended.

Family History is significant for breast cancer in: Sister 39 years, Mother 70 years, Paternal Aunt 60 years.
The most common type of breast cancer is invasive ductal (70-80%).  Invasive ductal carcinoma typically invades in a fashion creating irregular, stellate shapes.  A fibrous response is induced by the malignant cells; leading to a palpable mass, density on mammography and hypoechoic, shadowing nature on sonogram.  
Though only 15% of all breast cancers have a genetic factor involved, this patient has a history of two first degree relatives with breast cancer.  Annual mammograms would likely have lead to an earlier diagnosis and treatment.

Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System
BIRADS:
1 negative: no findings, routine follow up
2 benign: all findings suggest benign pathology, routine follow-up
3 probably benign: most findings suggest benign path, less than 2 percent probability of malignancy.  Short interval follow up is recommended
4 suspicious findings: consider biopsy, 2-75% of lesions are malignant
5 highly suggestive of malignancy:  recommend appropriate management; >75% of lesions of this category are malignant
0 incomplete.  Further imaging is needed to evaluate the tissue.

Many critics of the BIRADs system suggest only 4 classifications are needed: biopsy recommended, short interval followup necessary, benign findings, and incomplete study. 

Commonly used indications of malignancy on sonogram:  
1.	spiculation, 
2.	angular margins, 
3.	marked hypoechogenecity, 
4.	shadowing, 
5.	duct extension, 
6.	branch pattern, 
7.	microlobulation. 
8.	Architectural distortion, 
9.	taller than wide, 
10.	skin thickening, 
11.	marked vascularity
