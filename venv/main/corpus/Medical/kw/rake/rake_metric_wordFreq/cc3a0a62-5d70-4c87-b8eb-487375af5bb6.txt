The patient has more decreased hematocrit down to as low as 20 preoperatively and after transfusion of one unit, had decreased to 18
AVM was coiled with 6 3x3mm stainless coils.
Enlarged, tortuous subsegmental midpole renal artery malformation (1-2 cm) with two feeding vessels and early filling of renal vein and IVC.  Incidental note of replaced right hepatic artery to SMA.
Renal Arteriovenous Malformation
Arteriovenous malformation vs fistula.
A 30 -year-old man with recurrent significant gross hematuria, status-post right-sided stent placement, although hematuria preceded stent placement. Ureteroscopy on the right demonstrates blood to be coming from the right, although no identifiable source is noted.

Patient denies history of renal or abdominal trauma.
Although rare, this patient likely did have the congenitial malformation, as there was no history of antecedent trauma.  He was losing significant blood as gross hematuria.  Following embolization (with subsegmental infarction), the bleeding ceased and the patient improved clinically.
