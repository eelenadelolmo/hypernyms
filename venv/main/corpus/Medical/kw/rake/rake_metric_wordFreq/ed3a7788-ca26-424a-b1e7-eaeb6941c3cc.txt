Unremarkable knee exam.
Amputation versus limb-sparing
MRI: Periosteal enhancing lesions of the bilateral proximal tibiae.

CT: Destructive outer-cortically base lesions of the bilateral proximal tibiae.

Bone scan: Increased uptake anterior cortices of the bilateral proximal tibiae.
Osteosarcoma
Based on bone scan, possibly Osgood Schlatter; the other modalities--agrressive process, most likely osteosarcoma, less likely Ewing's, eosinophilic granuloma, infection.
11 yof several month history of bilateral knee pain, worse on the left.
