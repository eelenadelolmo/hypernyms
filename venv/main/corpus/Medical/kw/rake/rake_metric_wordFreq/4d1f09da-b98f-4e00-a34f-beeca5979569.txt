:  Although there are no prior studies for comparison, there is significantly increased pulmonary vascular markings when compared to the normal 8-month-old.  There is also an enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Osseous structures demonstrate a twelfth hypoplastic rib on the left.
Congestive heart failure secondary to an endocardial cushion defect
Single ventricle and hypoplastic left heart demonstrate significant cardiomegaly.   Transposition has a narrow aortic knob area
The patient is an 8-month-old girl who presents with a chronic cough for the last four months following an episode of hospitalization for bronchiolitis.  The patient also has breathing difficulties whenever stressed by illness.  The presence of a heart murmur was first noted on the second day of life, and the patient had a single cyanotic episode one month ago.  On physical exam, the patient was noted to have scattered crackles in all lung fields and a 3/6 blowing holosystolic and diastolic murmur.
