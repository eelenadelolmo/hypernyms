Diastolic murmur and stridor.
A bridging bronchus may produce recurrent wheezing, but it is unlikely to cause major problems in the absence of other malformations. Patients diagnosed with this anomaly should be further evaluated for associated malformations, particularly cardiovascular, in order to provide a more complete prognosis and treatment/followup plan.
Bronchial anomaly with right lower and middle lobe bronchus originating from the left main bronchus at the T6-T7 interspace with subsequent rightward passage through the mediastinum. The left pulmonary artery branches from the right pulmonary artery and extends posterior to the left main bronchus. Tetralogy of Fallot with left sided aortic arch is present. Ventricular septal defect is further imaged on cardiac catheterization.
Bridging Bronchus
None for this particular anomaly. The presenece of a bridging bronchus, however, should raise concern for other commonly associated malformations, particularly caridovascular.

Bronchial abnormalities are uncommon, with estimated incidence of 0.1% (Evans). A bridging bronchus is a particularly rare congenital anomaly in which the right middle and lower lobes are supplied by an aberrant left bronchus after it crosses the mediastinum. It is frequently associated with cardiac malformations such as left pulmonary artery sling (Capitanio). The presence of a bridging bronchus with tetralogy of Fallot and VATER syndrome malformations are also documented (Baden, Medina-Escobedo).
 
Two subtypes of bridging bronchus have been described. The first is characterized by a normal-appearing right main bronchus which branches from the carina and supplies only the right upper lobe.  The bridging bronchus is a branch from the left main bronchus, originating at approximately the T6-T7 interspace, to oxygenate the remaining right lung. The second subtype involves a short tracheal diverticulum originating at the T4-T5 level in place of the right main bronchus. The bridging bronchus courses rightward from the left main bronchus at the T6-T7 level to supply the right lower and middle lobes. Right lung hypoplasia is common with this variation (Wells).

A bridging bronchus may produce recurrent wheezing, but it is unlikely to cause major problems in the absence of other malformations (Schnabel). Patients diagnosed with this anomaly should be further evaluated for associated malformations, particularly cardiovascular, in order to provide a more complete prognosis and treatment plan. Bronchoscopy and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) provide adequate assessment of the tracheobronchial tree and mediastinal structures, though MDCT is preferred due to its short acquisition time and noninvasiveness (Baden).
