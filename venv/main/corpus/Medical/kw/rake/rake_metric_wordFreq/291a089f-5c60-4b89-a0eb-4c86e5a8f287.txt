Patient describes severe pain located at the area of the anatomical "snuff box."  Exam of right wrist showed severe radiocarpal joint line tenderness, > 50% decreased range of motion of radiocarpal joint in flexion and extension, normal grip strength, and increased laxity of wrist ligaments.  No laboratories ordered.
Patient will be placed in immobilization cast on day of presentation, cast will remain in place for first two weeks with repeat radiographs to assess displacement and bone status done once a week following immobilization.  After two weeks the cast will be removed and depending on stability of fracture and presence or absence of avascular necrosis patient will continue to be immobilized with repeat films as needed.  Given that the fracture is in the middle portion of the scaphoid bone, patient at increase risk of vascular compromise thus requiring prolonged healing time.  Healing of fracture determined clinically by absence of “snuff box” tenderness and radiographic evidence of trabecualtion of bone.
Posterior-anterior view with ulnar deviation of right wrist shows a lucent line in the mid-scaphoid consistent with a fracture, no evidence of avascular necrosis is present.
Scaphoid Fracture
Radiograph is definitive for scaphoid fracture
This 20-year-old patient presents with acute right wrist pain following a fall upon an outstretched hand while ice skating.  Patient states decreased range of motion, tenderness to her wrist area, and minimal swelling.
The scaphoid is the most commonly fractured carpal bone and comprises 60-7% of carpal fractures.  Carpal fractures occur usually occur in patients between ages 15 and 40 years and are rare in the child or in patients over 60 years of age. These fractures are associated with soft tissue swelling, ligamentous disruption, and/or neurovascular compromise.  On physical exam patients will often have "snuff box" tenderness. A patient with "snuff box" tenderness and history of falling with outstretched hands should be considered as having a scaphoid fracture even when radiographs are initially normal.  Approximately 90% of fractures occur within the proximal and middle thirds of the scaphoid. These fractures are at higher risk for delayed union and avascular necrosis and may require prolonged healing time as compared with scaphoid fractures in the distal third that are at low risk for delayed union and usually heal within 6 weeks.  Prognosis and management of patients are based on anatomical location of the fracture and fracture stability.  Patients are radiographed at weekly intervals for the first 2 weeks after immobilization, followed by prescribed interval x-rays.  Fracture healing is determined clinically by absence of "snuff box" tenderness and  on the radiographs by bridging trabeculae with disappearance of lucent fracture.
