N/A
Patient had subsequent penile revascularization surgery to correct for erectile dysfunction.
The paired dorsal arteries and cavernosal arteries of the penis arise from the internal pudendal arteries bilaterally.  The cavernosal branches are inferior to the dorsal branches and somewhat smaller in caliber.  

In this patient selective arteriograms of the internal pudendal arteries demonstrates congenital abscence of the right cavernosal artery.  Notice that the right dorsal artery of the penis is hypertrophied to help compensate for limited blood flow to the right crura of the penis.
Congenital absence of the right cavernosal artery causing erectile dysfunction
Congenital absence of the right cavernosal artery 
Post traumatic occlusion of the right cavernosal artery 
Thrombosis of or embolization to the right cavernosal artery 
Vasculidity or vasculopathy affecting the right cavernosal artery
36 year old African American male with long history of difficulty attaining a penile erection without medications.
Patient demonstrated erectile dysfunction secondary compromised arterial inflow.  Young patients are amenable to penile revascularization with a subjective effectiveness of 40-85%.
