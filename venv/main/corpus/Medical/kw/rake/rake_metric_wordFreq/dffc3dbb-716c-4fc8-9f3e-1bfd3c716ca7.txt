Texto: 
Left proximal arm pain and limited range of motion.
•	Present as pathological fractures, otherwise asymptomatic
•	Management :  prevent fracture, facilitate healing
–	Allow fracture to heal
–	Intralesional steroid injection
–	Autogenous marrow injection
–	Currettage and bone grafting 
•	Large lesions/septations = poor treatment response
•	Radiographic healing response: ossification of cyst, reduced size, cortical thickening
Plain films of the left shoulder and arm: Centrally located large expansile and lytic lesion of the proximal humeral metaphysis and diaphysis.  
There is an intertrochanteric fracture. 
Endosteal scalloping and septations are seen.

• Solitary Bone Cyst
• Aneurysmal Bone Cyst
• Giant Cell Tumor
• Fibrous Dysplasia
• Infection
• Eosinophilic Granuloma
18 y.o. man with a known seizure disorder  has pain in the arm after a recent fall.
Etiology is generally unknown.  Always central in location and often seen in the proximal humerus and femur. “Fallen fragment” sign identifies the lesion as a fluid filled cyst and results from a bone fragment falling with gravity from a prior fracture.
