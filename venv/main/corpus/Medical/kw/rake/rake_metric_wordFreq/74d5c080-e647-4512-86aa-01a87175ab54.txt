The external cervical os was closed.
No vaginal bleeding.
When the placental edge is greater than 2 cm from the internal cervical os, women can be offered a trial of labor with a high expectation of success. However, a distance of less than 2 cm from the os is associated with a higher cesarean rate, although vaginal delivery is still possible depending on the clinical circumstances.  

For an uncomplicated pregnancy with placenta previa, the patient can be followed as an outpatient until an episode of bleeding occurs. If bleeding or contractions occur, the patient must rapidly go to the hospital for evaluation. If bleeding persists and is heavy, preparation for immediate surgery is indicated.
The initial transabdominal images show the fetus in cephalic presentation.  The tip of the placenta was initially thought to lie greater than 3 cm from the cervical os on the transabdominal images.  However, the tip of the placenta was not clearly defined and there was concern that the fetal head may have been causing shadowing artifact obscuring the true tip of the placenta.  As a result, translabial imaging was performed which showed a marginal/partial placenta previa.
Marginal/Partial Placenta Previa
Normal lying placenta:  	Placenta lies greater than 2 cm from internal os
Low lying placenta:  		Placenta lies within 2 cm of internal os
Marginal placenta previa: 	Placenta extends to margin of internal os
Partial placenta previa:	Placenta partially covers internal cervical os
Complete placenta previa: 	Placenta crosses over and covers internal os
The patient presents for follow up of a low lying placenta detected on prior obstetric sonogram.
This is an excellent case demonstrating how the fetus can obscure visualization of the placenta on transabdominal imaging and how translabial imaging can assist with further evaluation.  Transvaginal imaging could have been performed as well.  Transvaginal imaging can be helpful when bowel gas obscures visualization of the cervix during translabial imaging.  Transvaginal imaging is not contraindicated with placenta previa; however, care should be taken not to insert the probe too close to the external cervical os.
