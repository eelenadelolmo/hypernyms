Radiofrequency ablation with desired result.  Please see factoid.
Noncontrast axial CT images of the lower lumbar spine show a round, 8mm lucent bone lesion with surrounding dense sclerotic reaction at the anterior aspect of the L5 vertebral body, consistent with osteoid osteoma.  Subsequent CT images show an 11 guage Rita insulated bone biopsy needle with its tip at the center of the lucent nidus.  The tines of a LeVeen radiofrequency ablation needle are seen projecting from the tip of the bone biopsy needle and are also positioned within the nidus.
