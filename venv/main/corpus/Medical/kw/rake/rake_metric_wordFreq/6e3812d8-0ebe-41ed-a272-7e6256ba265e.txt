right proptosis
Conservative Rx or XRT
• Right optic nerve mass which is isointense on T1 and T2.  
• A peripheral rim of T2 bright signal may be secondary to nerve sheath dilatation (CSF intensity) or in the setting of NF1, this finding may correspond to arachnoidal gliomatosis.
• Intense enhancement.
• Cannot distinguish mass from optic nerve.
Optic glioma
• Optic nerve glioma (astrocytoma)

» much less likely
• Meningioma
• Hemangioma
• Schwannoma
2 y/o boy with right proptosis.
Of note: This patient also had nonspecific T2/FLAIR white matter hyperintensities.  In the setting of optic nerve glioma, these may represent NF bodies (focal areas of signal intensity).  Further history and physical exam findings are pending to see if patient meets NF1 criteria.
