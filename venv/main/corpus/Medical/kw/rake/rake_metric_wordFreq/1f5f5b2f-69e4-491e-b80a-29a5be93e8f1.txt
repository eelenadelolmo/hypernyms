PE: Pt was noted to be hypoxemic. (Note: Further H&P records unavailable)
Labs: 
CBC – 10.0/16.1/48.6/201; CMP – BUN 29 (o/w ~wnl)
AFB culture – negative p 6 wks; Mycology – no fungal growth p 6 wks; Bacteriology (bronchial washing) – few gm neg rods
Histology – squamous cell CA and squamous cell CA in-situ
Radiation therapy
            Chemotherapy (Carboplatin, Taxol)
            Bronchoscopy repeated with radiologic follow-up (Pt most recently c enlarging nodules at site of treated    
            malignancy.)
CXR – increased opacity over lower T-spine on lateral film
CT – spiculated mass (~2cm) in RLL c reticular stranding in contact c pleura; no chest wall invasion
PET – increased radiotracer uptake along posterior aspect of R mediastinum in region of R atrium
Non-small cell (squamous cell) carcinoma of the lung (RLL); T3N2M0, corresponding to stage III-A
Based upon radiographic demonstration of pulmonary mass:
Malignancy (primary versus metastatic)
Benign neoplasm
Granulomatous disease (e.g., TB, fungal, sarcoidosis)
Other inflammation (e.g., pneumonia, abscess)
Congenital abnormality
May also consider foreign body or mucus plug
74 y/o male (retired O-8 physician) c hx of COPD and s/p CABG and MV replacement presents c SOB and productive cough. (Note: Further H&P records unavailable)
Based upon the radiographic findings for this patient, the diagnostic possibilities included the differential diagnosis for a pulmonary mass (as above). The definitive diagnosis was made with bronchoscopy and histologic examination, which was consistent with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.

             The American Cancer Society estimated over 160,000 deaths in the United States from lung cancer in 2004, and 87% of all deaths from lung cancer are attributed to tobacco use1. Lung cancer is generally categorized histologically into one of four major types of carcinoma: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell, large cell, and small cell. The former three are distinguished from the latter as non-small cell tumors, in contradistinction to small cell carcinoma, which is generally faster growing and will more likely respond to chemotherapy. Small cell carcinoma only accounts for about 20% of all lung cancers, while the remaining 80% are mostly non-small cell tumors. The type of non-small cell carcinoma seen in this patient, squamous cell, accounts for 20-30% of all lung cancers. It can be distinguished histologically based upon keratin production and the presence of intercellular bridges as seen on light microscopy. 

             In terms of clinical presentation, cough is present in 45-75% of patients with lung cancer2, and is the most common associated symptom. Squamous cell carcinoma in particular may be associated with elevated serum calcium levels (not noted in this patient) secondary to production of a parathyroid-like hormone, although hypercalcemia may also be the result of metastatic bone disease. Initial workup includes a chest x-ray with two views. While most lesions, even those less than 3 cm in diameter (i.e., T1 lesions) can be identified with radiographs, CT is, of course, more sensitive. 

             Imaging is also a necessary tool in terms of staging. CT is helpful for identifying the most common sites of metastases from bronchogenic carcinoma—specifically, metastatic liver or adrenal disease, and these organs are generally assessed regardless of whether or not the patient is symptomatic. Other imaging studies for staging are generally reserved for patients whose presentation may suggest involvement of other organs3, such as the brain or the bones. PET may be useful in finding metastatic disease, and according to one source, “Currently, the accuracy of PET in the detection of M stage is 96%”.4 This patient’s PET scan revealed an area of increased radiotracer uptake consistent with malignancy in the lower lobe of the right lung, and was otherwise normal.

             Treatment options and prognosis for non-small cell carcinoma of the lung vary depending on the type of tumor, the degree of differentiation, and the stage of disease. This patient was found to be a T3N2M0, which equates to a stage III-A, signifying locally advanced disease. While stage III-A is technically operable, the role of surgery in stage III disease is somewhat controversial. Additionally, among patients with non-small cell carcinoma undergoing surgical resection, there is a 50% relapse rate. Treatment options other than surgery include radiation and chemotherapy. Radiation therapy, while palliative, does not improve survival over the long-term for most patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer.5 Following radiation therapy, this patient underwent chemotherapy with carboplatin and Taxol. Overall, the 5-year survival rate associated with stage III-A N2 disease is 10-15%.
