Transcatheter embolization or coils are first line therapies for these lesions.
2.5 cm mass in upper pole of the left kidney.  It demonstrates flow voids on T2 images, is heterogeneous on T1 images, and enhances with gadolinium.  On MR angiogram reconstructions, there are two large vessels associated with this lesion.  One, and perhaps both, arise from the abdominal aorta.
