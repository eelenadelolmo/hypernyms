Ordering provider reports crackles and wheezing within the right lower lung field.
As with all adult air space opacities at our institution, radiographic follow-up to resolution is recommended to excluded underlying obstructing mass.  First imaging is generally performed 4 weeks after the initial study.
On frontal projection there is a vague air space opacity which partially obscures the right heart border while sparing the right hemidiaphragm.  On lateral projection there is consolidation within the right middle lobe overlying the heart shadow which outlines the major fissure.
