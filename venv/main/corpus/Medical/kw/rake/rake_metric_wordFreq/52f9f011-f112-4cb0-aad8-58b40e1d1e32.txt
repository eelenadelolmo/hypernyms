The patient underwent excision of the lesion and evacuation of the hematoma.
CT followed by MR (Fig. 1a-f) demonstrated a nodular lesion in the right frontal subcortical region, surrounded by an area of hematoma in late subacute stage and by hyperintense perilesional oedema on T1WI.
Cerebral cavernous malformation.
The differential diagnosis was between cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM, cavernoma) and haemorrhagic metastasis.
A 33-year-old man presented with headache, left hemiparesis, hemihypoesthesia and partial seizures of the left arm for a week. No personal or familial significant history was present.

CCM is considered the third most prevalent vascular malformation of the brain, after development venous anomaly (DVA) and capillary telangiectasia, affecting 0.5% to 0.7% of the population. 

Histologically, CCM is formed by dilated capillaries without elastic and muscular tunics, which makes it susceptible to multiple bleedings and explains the MR appearance of haemorrhage in different phases of evolution. It is limited at the periphery by a pseudocapsule of gliotic brain infiltrated by hemosiderin, resulting in a hypointense peripheral ring on T2WI. When associated with DVA, the main hypothesis of the pathogenesis of CCM sustains that the first step is a hyperpressure in a branch of the DVA. This produces high pressure in the capillary bed and chronic microbleeds which stimulate fibroblastic and endothelial proliferation with the final result of CCM. As well, cavernoma can also occur as a result of radiation injury, through a similar mechanism of proliferation and dilatation of the vascular endothelium and capillaries.

CCM can affect all cerebral regions, albeit it is more frequent in the subcortical areas of frontal and temporal lobes. When situated in the posterior fossa, it has a tendency to involve the pons and the cerebellar hemispheres. One third to one half of CCM are clinically silent. The symptomatology is usually associated with haemorrhagic events.

There are different forms to classify CCM, the most used being the sporadic versus familial forms and the Zabramski classification. The sporadic form usually presents as a unique lesion and it has strong association with DVA which is commonly adjacent to the CCM and involved in its pathogenesis. On the other hand, the familial form is represented by multiple lesions, has no association with DVA and it does have higher risk of complications. The Zabramski classification is based on the haemorrhagic aspect of CCM and includes: type 1, subacute haemorrhage (hyperintense on T1WI, hyper- or hypointense on T2WI), type 2, "popcorn ball" appearance (mixed-signal intensity on T1- and T2WI, hypointense ring on T2WI), type 3, chronic haemorrhage (iso- or hypointense on T1- and T2WI, also hypointense ring) and type 4, patchy microbleeds (punctate hyperintense lesions on T2*, "black dots").

On CT, up to half of CCM cannot be identified, the others being slightly hyperdense, well defined, sometimes with calcifications. The MR appearance is heterogeneous, consequence of different stages of haemorrhage. A hypointense peripheral ring frequently appears on T2WI, explained by the presence of hemosiderin. On T2*-Gradient Recalled Echo (GRE) and Susceptibility-Weighted Imaging (SWI) it manifests high susceptibility magnetic properties, presenting pronounced hypointense signal. When a CCM is studied, the administration of contrast is recommended in order to search for a DVA. The reasons are the high association between the two malformations and, more importantly, when dealing with a surgical CCM, being aware of the presence of a DVA is essential in order to avoid a venous infarct which would result from cutting the DVA. CCM usually does not enhance. Sometimes it is difficult to differentiate a complicated cavernoma from a haemorrhagic neoplasm. Noteworthily, it was showed that hyperintense perilesional signal on T1WI can be seen in more than half of the patients with CCM, this being of particular value when the diagnosis is uncertain and a therapeutic decision is required [AJNR 2008;29:494–500].
