Axillary lesions: Multiple 2-3mm hyperpigmented macules in the bilateral axilla.
Upper extremities and back with large hyperpigmented macules and patches in various size consistent with Caf? au lait spots.
Lower extremities: Large 18 x 9cm boggy hyperpigmented plaque on the left lateral thigh. It has a "bag of worms" feel and is moderately tender on palpation.
The patient was advised to follow up with her OBGYN for routine pregnancy care. There is no specific treatment for neurofibromatosis type 1, but routine surveillance for complications is recommended. The patient was counseled to seek follow up with an ophthalmologist for a full eye exam and to maintain regular follow ups with her primary care physician. There is the potential for large plexiform lesions to undergo malignant degeneration which could present as rapid change in size and increased pain. At this time, the punch biopsy showed no malignant changes. No further treatment of the mass was warranted, but the patient was encouraged to follow up later after delivery.
The images below demonstrate a large subcutaneous mass on the left lower extremity.
Neurofibromatosis type 1
Differential includes Leguis Syndrome, McCune-Albright Syndrome, and Watson Syndrome
This is a 21 year old G2P1 at 28 weeks who presents for evaluation of a large mass on her left lateral thigh. The mass has been present since childhood and has been stable in size for many years. During her current pregnancy, the mass began to grow slightly and increased in pain. The patient endorses pain with minor trauma that lasts for days. The patient denies any weakness or altered sensation in the leg. No night sweats, fevers, chills, or weight loss noted by the patient.
This is a 22 year old G2P1 at 28 weeks, with a pmh of neurofibromatosis type 1, who presented for evaluation of a large mass on her left lateral thigh.  A punch biopsy was performed to rule out malignant degeneration into a peripheral nerve sheath tumor. Punch biopsy of the lesion revealed a plexiform neurofibroma without malignant changes. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors can occur from large plexiform lesions. Patient's with neurofibromatosis type 1 have a 10% lifetime risk of developing one of these tumors. Routine surveillance of large neurofibromas especially plexiform neurofibromas is recommended. Plexiform neurofibromas can grow to be very large and locally invasive which can lead to cosmetic and functional concerns. Complete resection of the lesion is difficult but can be undertaken if if the lesion causes the patient functional problems or cosmetic concerns.
