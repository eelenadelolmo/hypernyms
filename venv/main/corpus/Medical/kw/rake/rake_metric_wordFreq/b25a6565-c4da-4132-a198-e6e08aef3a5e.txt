Palpable mass in region of proximal humerus on left.
No treatment was necessary as long as patient tolerates the cosmesis of the mass.  Could be resected if patient prefers, or if it starts to cause any symptoms from mass effect.  Follow up imaging if the mass increases in size to confirm stability of its MR appearance.
Plain Radiograph:  Around the proximal humerus is a large radiolucent mass in the soft tissues of the upper left arm. This measures approximately 15 x 7 cm in the frontal plane, aligning with the long axis of the humerus. No osseous erosions, periosteal reaction or hyperostosis is present in the humerus.

MRI:  Within the subfacial layers, between the Deltoid and Triceps muscle is a large homogeneous mass that is partially wrapping around the proximal humerus.  It measures approximately  11 cm AP x 5 cm TRV x 9 cm CC.  This mass follows the signal characteristics of subcutaeaous fat on all imaging sequences.  It is high signal intensity on T1W images and low signal intensity on T2W fat saturated images.  There is no significant enhancement of this mass after IV gadolinium administration.  There are very thin septations throughout this mass that show only minimal contrast enhancement.
Soft Tissue Lipoma
Given imaging characteristics no real differential.  If the mass were more heterogeneous, the septations were thicker and if it demonstrated more enhancement, could consider well differentiated Liposarcoma.
51 year old women who noticed a painless mass in her upper arm.
