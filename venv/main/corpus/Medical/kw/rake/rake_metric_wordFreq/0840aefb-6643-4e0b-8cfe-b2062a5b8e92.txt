PTH intact: 237 pg/mL (13-75 pg/mL)

Treatment is surgical after localization with imaging methods.
Adjacent to the mid to lower pole of the left thyroid lobe posteriorly is a 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.8 cm ovoid homogeneous solid hypoechoic mass.  It is well circumscribed and there is no cystic components or calcifications identified.  This is the only abnormality found.
PARATHYROID ADENOMA

62 y/o female with primary hyperparathyroidism diagnosed by clinician
ULTRASOUND 

Appearance Sonographically:  Parathyroid adenomas are characteristically hypoechoic due to the uniform hypercellularity of the gland (few interfaces to reflect sound).  The echogenecity of the vast majority of parathyroid adenomas is substantially less than that of thyroid tissue.  The characteristic adenoma is homogeneously solid.  About 2% have internal cystic components that are due to cystic degeneration or true simple cysts (less commonly).  Rare adenomas may contain focal internal calcification.  These lesions are most commonly oval.  As the glands enlarge, they can dissect between longitudinally oriented tissue planes in the neck and acquire oblong shape.  There is often asymmetric enlargement with one end becoming more bulbous, producing triangular, tapering or teardrop shapes.  Most parathyroid adenomas are 0.8 to 1.5 cm long and weigh 500 to 1000 mg.

Typical Locations:  The superior parathyroid adenoma typically is adjacent to the posterior aspect of the midportion of the thyroid.  The typical location of the inferior parathyroid adenoma is more variable, but usually lies close to the caudal tip of the lower pole of the thyroid.  Most are adjacent to the posterior aspect of the thyroid, but the rest are in the soft tissues 1 to 2 cm inferior to the thyroid.  About 1% to 3% of parathyroid adenomas are ectopic and will not be found in the usual locations.  Examples are, retro tracheal, mediastinal, intrathyroid and carotid sheath locations.

Differentiate from Carcinoma:  Sonographically, carcinomas are usually larger than adenomas.  The average carcinoma is more then 2 cm, in contrast to about 1 cm for adenoma.  Carcinomas also frequently have a lobulated contour, heterogeneous internal architecture and internal cystic components.  Although large adenomas can also have these features, and in most cases prospective carcinomas are indistinguishable from large adenomas.
