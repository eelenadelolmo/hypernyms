Wide excision with placement of proximal humeral prostheses.
AP left shoulder: 2001 –  an ill-defined sclerotic density is present within the humeral head adjacent to the articular surface.  A subtle ring of lucency can be seen around the centralThere is no evidence of sclerotic margin, periostitis, soft tissue mass. 
	
	AP shoulder: 2002 – There has been interval increase in the amount of amorphous calcific density within the lesion.  

	CT shoulder – a round lesion is noted within the humeral head.  This lesion has a central area of dense calcification surrounded by a area of “fluffy” calcification.  An area of lucency then surrounds this.  There is no clear violation of the overlying cortex.
	
	MR – Coronal/Axial TI – A well-defined low signal abnormality is noted in the subchondral bone of the humeral head.  A central punctuate area of signal void is present representing the dense calcification seen on CT. There is no significant surrounding edema or joint effusion. The overlying cortex is intact.

	MR – Coronal/Axial T2 – The lesion demonstrates high signal with central area of low signal representing dense calcification.
Clear Cell Chondrosarcoma
Differential Considerations:
	Bone lesions which may have this appearance in this location include:
	-chondroblastoma
	-clear cell chondrosarcoma
	-osteoblastoma	
	-sclerotic metastasis
	-brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism – in healing phase due to calcification
