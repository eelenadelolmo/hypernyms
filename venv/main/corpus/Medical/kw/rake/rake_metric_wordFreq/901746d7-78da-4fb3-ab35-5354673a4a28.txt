Respiratory distress with decreased breath sounds on the left
o Immediate chest tube for associated contralateral pneumothorax
o Early surgery for diaphragm repair without the use of ECMO
The initial chest radiograph shows multiple left intrathoracic air-filled loops of bowel with shift of mediastinal structures to the right and paucity of bowel gas in the abdomen.

Immediate post-operative radiograph demonstrates lucency in the left hemithorax with continued shift of midline structures to the right, due to pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum. The pneumothorax is evidenced by the deep sulcus sign on the left. The pneumomediastinum is indicated by the visible superior border of the heart. 

4 week follow-up radiograph shows the small size of the left lung with mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (Bochladek-type)
o congenital diaphragmatic hernia (Bochladek)
o lobar emphysema
o cystic adenoid malformation
Newborn with respiratory distress
The morbity of CDH primarily relates to the hypoplasia of the affected developing lung(s).  Many cases are diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound. If severe, the delivery is planned at a location where Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is available.  Use of ECMO allows the patient to survive while the hypoplastic lung grows after surgical correction of the diaphragmatic defect. Post-surgery, there is often an ipsilateral therapeutic pneumothorax, which cushions and protects the hypoplastic lung from barotrauma from positive pressure ventilation. On follow-up, the ipsilateral lung usually remains small, as seen in this case.
