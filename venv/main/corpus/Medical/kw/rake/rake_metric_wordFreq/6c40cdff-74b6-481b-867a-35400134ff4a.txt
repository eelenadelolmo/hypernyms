Serum AFP > 27 Multiples-of-the-Median (MoM)
She was managed conservatively. Three months after delivery of the viable fetus, she was re-imaged with pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the extrauterine fetus in the right cul-de-sac was noted to be significantly smaller.
On her 18-week obstetrical ultrasound examination, a viable intrauterine pregnancy was noted with gestational age of 19 weeks.  However, a 10.8 x 5.4cm bilobed mass was noted in the right pelvic cul-de-sac suggestive of a non-viable heterotopic (ectopic) pregnancy.  Three months after delivery, she was re-imaged with pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the extrauterine fetus in the right cul-de-sac was noted to be significantly smaller
Lithopedion
Lithopedion (fetal demise; retained calcified fetus)
Teratoma (usually disorganized)
Fetus-in-fetu
29 y.o. woman with intermittent bouts of abdominal pain during the 1st and early 2nd trimester (family history of endometriosis)
Lithopedion refers to a calcified non-viable extrauterine fetus, usually the result of a failed ectopic (or heterotopic) pregnancy.  This diagnosis is fairly rare.  Generally, a lithopedion is encountered with failed extrauterine pregnancies with gestational age > 14 weeks; these advanced pregnancies usually are not fully reabsorbed.  As a result,  the fetus and/or its covering membranes calcify, shielding the mother’s body from the degenerating fetal tissue.
