Phyisical exam was noncontributory.  Laboratory values were unremarkable.
There is a large, heterogenous region of intense FDG hypermetabolic activity in the mid to lower right posterior hemithorax. Multiple photopenic (cold) areas within this region are suggestive of tumor necrosis.  Of note, there is no other definite evidence of metastatic disease in the mediastinum or elsewhere in the images. Physiologic renal excretion of tracer is noted with activity present in the bilateral renal collecting systems, likely distal right ureter and urinary bladder.  Incidental note is made of faint linear activity in the right lateral chest wall that suggests recent chest tube placement.
Staging non-small cell lung cancer
-Primary malignancy
-Active granulomatous disease (Tb, sarcoidosis, fungal, lipoid pneumonia, talc granulomata)
-Pneumonitis and necrosis following high-dose radiation therapy.
55 year old male with known non-small cell lung cancer of the right lung.  A PET scan is requested for staging.
