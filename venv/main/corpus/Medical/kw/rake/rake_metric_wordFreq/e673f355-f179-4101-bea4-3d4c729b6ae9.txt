GEN: Mild distress, AOX3
CARDIAC: RRR
LUNG: CTA
ABDOMEN: Tender RUQ w/ rebound tenderness and muscle guarding
Surgical intervention to include right radical nephrectomy. An appendectomy was also performed at the same time as the nephrectomy because of imaging that showed the appendix to be prominent with mucosal enhancing and increased in normal caliber measuring approximately 9 mm. This inflammation was thought to be potentially  secondary to the surrounding fluid from the hemorrhage, but appendicitis could not be excluded.
• The right retroperitoneum has a large(11 X 9 cm) heterogeneous intrarenal lesion coming off the posterior mid portion of the kidney. Part of this mass has low-attenuation in region of fat.

• Both intra and extra to this lesion is a well circumscribed 13 x 11 cm fluid collection with high attenuation.
Angiomyolipoma
• angiomyolipoma
• angiomyolipoma complicated by hemorrhage
• renal cell carcinoma
• hemorrhagic ruptured renal cyst
• traumatic kidney rupture
46 year-old man with one-day history of right flank pain and right lower quadrant pain with pain that is persistent and throbbing in nature.
Fat containing masses of the kidney are usually benign and only rarely harbor malignancy.
