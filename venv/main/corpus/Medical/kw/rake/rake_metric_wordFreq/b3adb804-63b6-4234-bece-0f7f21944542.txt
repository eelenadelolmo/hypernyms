On physical exam, the patient is alert and oriented
    and active appropriate for her age.  She has an appearance of large periarticular masses.  The patient has large appearing shoulders, elbows, wrists, as well as knees and ankles.  She has a visible deformity to her right lower extremity about the distal aspect of the tibia with a varus deformity worse than on the right.  She is slightly shorter on the right leg. Her range of motion is near full on the right, and left knee and hip as well as ankle.  Her shoulders, elbows, and wrists have slight decreased range of motion, but are equal bilaterally.  Her left hand has slightly more
prominent on the fingers than the right, but both appear to be affected.
+   She has no obvious spinal deformities to speak of. Muscle tone is normal, without tenderness to palpation.  All of her extremities are neurovascularly intact.
Frontal radiograph of the lower extremities demonstrates polyostotic lucent expansile lesions within all of the imaged long bones.  There is extensive involvement primarily of the metaphyseal portions of the long bones.  No soft tissue calcifications are demonstrated.
