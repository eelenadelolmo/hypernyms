11 year old boy, with known type I diabetes, presents to ER with a seizure.  Has a persistent left sided weakness following seizure.
Since the boy had no obvious skin or other finding consistent with Sturge Weber and an unexplained persistent left hemiplegia meningitis or vasculiltis was suspected.  

Consequently he had a negative cerebral angiogram followed by leptomeningeal biopsy.
