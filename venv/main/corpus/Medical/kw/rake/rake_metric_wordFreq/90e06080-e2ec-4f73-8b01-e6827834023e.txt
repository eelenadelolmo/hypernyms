The patient was asymptomatic.  He was anticoagulated.  He will undergo regular CT examinations to evaluate the arterial system for evidence of aneurysmal dilatation and new dissections.
Carotid Ultrasound:  Dissection involving the right common carotid artery and extending into the right internal carotid artery.  Two lumens are separated by a thin intimal flap.  There is flow within both the true and false lumens.
Carotid Artery Dissection
Causes of Dissection:
Heritable connective-tissue disorders
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Type IV
Fibromuscular dysplasia
Cystic medial necrosis
Marfan Syndrome
Hypertension
The patient was status post surgery for a dissection involving the thoracic aorta.  Carotid ultrasound was requested to evaluate the patient for hemodynamically significant stenosis involving the carotid arteries.
Arterial dissection results in a tear in the intimal layer followed by propagation of a subintimal hematoma.  The dissecting hematoma produces a false lumen with flow to the major branching arteries arising from the true lumen.  Carotid artery dissections can result from an underlying arteriopathy, blunt trauma, hypertension, and even stretching the neck.
