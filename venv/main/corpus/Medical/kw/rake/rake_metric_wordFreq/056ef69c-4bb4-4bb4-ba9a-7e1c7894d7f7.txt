No evidence of adenopathy in the cervical or supraclavicular regions was found.  Patient has a history of multinodular goiter and toxic multinodular goiter treated with suppressive synthroid and a single I131 treatment, respectively.  Labs including CBC and CMP were normal.  TSH was 0.89.
Following gross debulking resection of the anterior neck mass, the patient was placed on radiotherapy and taxol chemotherapy to maximize local control.
CT of the neck with contrast: Examination reveals a somewhat heterogenous mass with slightly ill-defined contours containing foci of calcifications measuring approximately 4.4 x 3.5 cm transverse dimensions x 4 cm craniocaudad in the midline pretracheal region of the lower neck and thoracic inlet.  No fat plane separation is seen between the mass and the trachea.  The normal thyroid gland cannot be identified.  

The naso-, oro- and hypopharynx, larynx, oral cavity, parotid and submandibular glands are unremarkable.  Besides the above mentioned mass, there is no evidence of a CT criteria lymph node enlargement in the demonstrated neck.  

The demonstrated lung apices are clear.  

There are no osteolytic or blastic lesions suspicious for ossesous metastatic disease.
Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma
Congenital anomalies: branchial anomalies (cysts, sinuses, and fistulae), cystic hygromas (lymphangiomas) and dermoids, thyroglossal duct cyst, thymic rests                            
Inflammation: inflammatory lymphadenopathy, chronic sialadenitis, cervical adenitis     
Infection: bacterial, viral and fungal infections,  Staphylococcus and , typical and atypical mycobacteria, cat-scratch disease, toxoplasmosis, infectious mononucleosis                         Trauma: new or organized hematomas, pseudoaneurysm or an arteriovenous fistula       
Metabolic: gout, tumoral calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease                 Idiopathic: inflammatory pseudotumor, Kimura's disease, Castleman's disease, sarcoidosis 
Benign neoplasms: lipomas, hemangiomas, neuromas, and fibromas                                  
Malignant neoplasms: thyroid cancer, salivary gland cancer, lymphomas, sarcomas, mucosal head and neck cancer (oral cavity, larynx, pharynx), metastatic disease
60 year old female presented with a small lump at the base of her neck.  A CT scan was obtained revealing a 4 cm pretracheal mass and several small indeterminate nodules within the lung.
