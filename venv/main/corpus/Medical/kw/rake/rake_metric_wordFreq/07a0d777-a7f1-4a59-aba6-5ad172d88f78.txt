Therapeutic options:
 - Waiting
 - Biopsy of retro-ocular orbital masses
 - What about the pregnancy ?
 - Small surgery ? Versus exenteration but what about bone and brain ? (prognosis)
 - Radiotherapy ? Slow growing
 - Chemotherapy ? Few mitoses
Mass lesion, not well circumscribed, irradical
Apo clusters of spindle cells (melanocytes), mixed pigmentation, nuclei spindle mixed and variable, small nucleoli
some more aggressive clones of epitheloid cells, some mitosis with few mib1 + 
not removed in toto
Ct/mri/pet orbit, brain, thorax, abdomen
Nevus Ota and Melanoma
Nevus of Ota with new, slowly growing nodules; some more aggressive, documented growth
Not completely removed of eyelid and orbit
? Mass nodules in orbit surrounding optic nerve, muscles and vessels ?apo nevus or melanoma ?
Mass in left fossa infratemporalis, sinus maxillaris
new pregnancy
28 y old woman

Question about esthetical removal of pigmented nodules around left eye

Known since age of 4 with dark skin around eye

1983 begin growth nevus eyelid and temporal skin

1996 laser therapy of skin

1998 biopsy cellular blue nevus, mri small lesion in orbit 
around musc inf and med

2000 slowly variable growing mass orbit ?Vascular 

2004 fast growing while pregnant ?

Ophthalmo:normal, no melanosis of the eye but pigmentation of palpebral conjunctiva left eyelid

No proptosis, no exopthalmia

7-2005 incision biopsy: benign melanocytes

9-2005 wish of cosmetic debulking
Nevus of Ota:
 - Congenital oculodermal melanocytosis
 - Pigmented cells migrating from neural crest, arrested in their migration in the region of the trigeminal nerve
 - Blue nevus 
 - Racial differences: orientals-black race-white
 - More frequent in woman ?
 - Tumour malformations in eye, skin, orbit, meninges, central nervous system,
 - Incidence of tumour 0.5% to 25% (Dutton 1984)
 - Incidence of tumour formation in life in whites 1/400 (1/13000) (Singh 1998)

Primary Orbital Melanoma:
 - Primary orbital melanoma: 1 % of all orbital tumours, 
 - Primary orbital melanoma: 8 % of all orbital melanomas 
 - Primary orbital melanoma : nor precursors, due to aberrant localised melanocytes, migrating from neural crest
 - Pregnancy, incidence female-male, mean age 42
 - Prognostic parameters: apo, location, diameter
 - Metastatic lesions: lever
