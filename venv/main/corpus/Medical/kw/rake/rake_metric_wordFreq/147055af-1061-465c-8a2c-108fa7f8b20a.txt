The patient died.
Portable CXR: wires indicating a previous sternotomy; widening of the mediastinum

CT CAP w/ IV contrast: 1. large ascending aortic aneurysm w/ active extravasation of blood presumably from disruption of the graft material for the prior repair; the blood appears heterogenous indicating a mixing of the blood, 2. this is resulting in a large hemothorax extending into the mediastinal, pericardial, and R subpleural spaces, 3. there is displacement of heart and compression of the R heart and narrowing of the SVC.

This is a 60 year old man with a history of CAD s/p 2 vessel CABG and 3 stents, AAA s/p repair, ascending aortic dissection s/p repair, and 44 pack years of tobacco use who presented to ED complaining of sudden onset, non-exertional, right sided heart pain that radiated down his right arm.
The aortic rupture in case was presumed to have occured secondary to disruption of the graft material from the original aortic dissection rather than from an acute ascending aortic dissection.
