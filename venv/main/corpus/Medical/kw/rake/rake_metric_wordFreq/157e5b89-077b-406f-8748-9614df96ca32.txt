Healthy appearing male in no acute distress
Physical exam by ER physician was WNL.
The patient was admitted for observation overnight and repeat chest radiograph in the morning showed no pneumothorax on inspiration or expiration.  A follow up CT scan showed no pneumothorax or underlying lung disease as a possible cause.
Three view shoulder radiographs where obtained.  The osseous structures and joints are normal.  However, a pleural line is demonstrated in the left apex consistent with a spontaneous pneumothorax.
