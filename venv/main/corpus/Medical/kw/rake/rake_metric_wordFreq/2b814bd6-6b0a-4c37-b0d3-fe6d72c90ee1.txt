Gen: AAOx3, moderate distress
Lungs CTAB
Heart RRR, no m/r/g
Abdomen mildly distended, diffusely tender to palpation, tympanitic on percussion, high pitched bowel sounds

No pertinent laboratory findings
The patient has taken to surgery and had a portion of her small bowel resected. Intraoperative diagnosis was consistent with small bowel obstruction secondary to adhesions. No tumor or other lead points were identified.
Multiple dilated, fluid filled loops of bowel in a "knot" configuration with central mesenteric fluid are seen within the mid to lower abdomen consistent with a closed loop obstruction.  Dilated, fluid filled loops also occupy the left hemiabdomen measuring in excess of 3 cm in diameter consistent with a simple small bowel obstruction located proximal to the closed loop obstruction.  (It is important to remember that a distal closed loop obstruction will always have another simple obstruction within the more proximal small bowel.)

Much of the jejunum is displaced into the right hemiabdomen.  While no definite transition point is identified, there are disproportionate more normal appearing loops of bowel proximally and distally. Enhancement of the walls is still seen. No free intraperitoneal air is identified. There is a segment of dilated small bowel that demonstrates bowel wall thickening which may represent ischemia. 

Summary:
1. Small bowel obstruction most consistent with a closed loop obstruction distally. 
2. Simple small bowel obstruction located proximal to the closed loop obstruction.
3. Moderate ascites
4. No free intraperitoneal air
5. Possible ischemia (bowel wall thickening)

59 year old female presented to the ED with two days of worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. History of past abdominal surgeries.
