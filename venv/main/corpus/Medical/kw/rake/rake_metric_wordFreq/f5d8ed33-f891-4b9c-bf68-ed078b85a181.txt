Palpation/Percussion: Focal midline tenderness at the level of S1.
Active Thoracolumbar ROM: Flexion to 60 degrees, extension to 20 degrees, left rotation to 70 degrees, right rotation to 45 degrees, left lateral bending to 15 degrees, right lateral bending to 20 degrees. Movements in all directions elicited lower back pain radiating into the right lower extremity.
Reflexes: subpatellar and achilles 2+ bilaterally
Sensory: Diminished pin prick sensation along posterior aspect of right thigh in the distribution of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve. Diminished pin prick sensation along lateral aspects of both feet and both heels in the distribution of thick callous formation. No light touch sensory deficit in the lower extremities.
Muscle Strength: Right lower extremity: 4/5 flexor and extensor halluces; 4/5 ankle plantar flexor and dorsiflexor; 5/5 flexion and extension of knee. Left lower extremity: 5/5 flexor and extensor halluces; 5/5 ankle plantar flexor and dorsiflexor; 5/5 flexion and extension of knee.
Patient was able to walk on toes. Patient was imbalanced and reported lower back pain when attempting heel walk. Patient reported severe lower back pain attempting to squat. Positive straight leg raise at 45 degrees on the left with lower back pain radiating to the right knee, and at 35 degrees on the right with lower back pain radiating to the right ankle.
-	Analgesics - provide pain relief
-	Muscle relaxants have provided some relief for the patient during occasional muscle spasms, but are unlikely to relieve pain caused by nerve root compression
-	Activity modification to avoid movements that elicit pain, though bed rest is not generally recommended
-	Lumbar support belt to help attenuate pain between chiropractic treatments
-	Surgical discectomy is an option, but the patient has opted for more conservative treatment, saving surgery as a last resort
-	Chiropractic spinal manipulation and exercises 3 times per week – The patient reports relief from regular chiropractor visits that incorporate flexion distraction therapy, electrical muscle stimulation, and spine stabilizing McKenzie exercises. The patient’s chiropractor uses an atypical maneuver to relieve downward pressure exerted by the vertebral body onto the herniated disc.  The patient is positioned prone, slightly flexed, and strongly distracted, to create longitudinal tension on the spine.  The chiropractor uses his full body weight to deliver a caudad to cephalad thrust, decompressing the spine as the superior vertebra lifts off the disc.
MRI June

• Mild straightening of lumbar lordosis
• L3-L4: Right posterior lateral bulge encroaching on the right neural foramen and mildly effacing the right L3 nerve root.
• L4-L5: Disc desiccation. Diffuse posterior disc bulge mildly effacing the ventral thecal sac.
• L5-S1: Disc desiccation and mild disc space narrowing. Posterior bulge and broad based right posterior herniation indenting the ventral thecal sac and moderately indenting the right S1 nerve root.

•Disc herniation / bulge
•Lumbosacral/Sacroiliac strain or sprain

A 44 year old man, without any known chronic medical conditions, presented with lower back pain following a work injury in April. At the time of injury, the patient was lifting approximately 100 pounds of wet laundry and twisting from right to left to throw it, when he felt a sudden sharp 10/10 pain in his lower back shooting down his right leg to his toes.  He went to the emergency department, where he received prescriptions for Motrin 600mg and Robaxin 500mg.

He had a prior work-related MVA injury to his lower back 11 years ago.  He received an IDET procedure at L3-L4 9 yrs PTA, and returned to work without restrictions four years ago. He indicated that he was fully recovered from his previous injury eleven years ago, and without any pain or residual symptoms by the time he was injured this year.
The patient currently complains of 6/10 midline lower back pain radiating to his right lower extremity through the hip, posterolateral thigh, calf and foot. His pain is exacerbated with bending, twisting, sitting, and standing, and typically wakes him up at least once each night.  He experiences some relief with walking, as well as with Robaxin and chiropractic treatments. He has also noticed loss of range of motion of his back and occasional numbness and parasthesias in his right lower extremity through the hip, posterolateral thigh, calf, and foot. He experiences right leg weakness and his right leg sometimes “goes out” when he is climbing stairs. He denies any bladder or bowel incontinence.

The patient’s MRI study demonstrates L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1 disc bulges. The patient does not demonstrate signs of L4 radiculopathy, suggesting that the L3-L4 disc bulge may be a remnant from or exacerbation of his first back injury in 2000, which is not contributing to his recent symptoms. The L4-L5 disc bulge is associated with right sided L5 radiculopathy, as evidenced by weak dorsiflexion of the right great toe and foot, difficulty heel walking, and numbness, paresthesias, and pain radiating through the right lower extremity in an L5 distribution. The L5-S1 disc bulge is associated with right sided S1 radiculopathy, as evidenced by weak plantar flexion of the great toe and foot, and numbness, parasthesias, and pain radiating through the right lower extremity in an S1 distribution.  Prior examinations of the patient have also demonstrated difficulty with toe walking, and an asymmetric Achilles reflex (1/4 on the right and 2/4 on the left), suggesting some improvement of the S1 radiculopathy over the 4 months since the injury.  Overall improvement has also been seen in the patient’s pain severity (from 10/10 to 6/10) and his thoracolumbar range of motion.

On a recent Pain Disability Questionnaire, the patient had a total score of 90 (functional 53; psychosocial 37), which is rated as a “moderate disability.”
