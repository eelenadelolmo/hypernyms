Painful Watson-test though not evidently positive. No swelling. Normal range of motion.
The patient had a treatment where a vascularised distal radial bone segment is harvested and grafted into the lunate.
On the x-ray of the right hand (before operation) there is a linear subchondral lucency of the lunate on the ulnar side. There is a irregularity of the proximal contour of the lunate. There is slight sclerosis and flattening of the lunate.

On the MRI there is a hypointense signal on the T1WI of the lunate (the T2WI the lunate had an isointense signal).
