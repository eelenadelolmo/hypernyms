Physical exam significant for abnormal heart sounds and holosystolic murmer.
1. Danielson type repair of the tricuspid valve for Ebstein anomaly with insertion of a Medtronic CG Future Band annuloplasty ring.

2. Reduction of right atrium.
Moderate to severe Ebstein's anomaly is present. The attachment of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve is apically displaced by 3.8 cm with apical displacement of the functional tricuspid valve plane. 

The septal and posterior leaflets of the tricuspid valveare are small and dysplastic. The anterior leaflet is tethered with restricted movement. There is severe tricuspid regurgitation, quantified at 41%.

The inflow portion of the right ventricle is almost completely atrialized. The outflow and apical trabecular component of the right ventricle are dilated but with preserved systolic function. The combined area of the right atrium and the atrialized portion of the right ventricle is almost equal to that of the functional right ventricle and the left heart. There is no right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. 

Incidentally noted is trabeculated non compacted myocardium in the left ventricle with normal systolic left ventricular function.
Ebstein's Anomaly
A number of conditions which enlarge the right heart.
The differentiating feature is the abnormal position of the tricuspid valve.
The patient is a 13-year-old female with a known history of Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve. She has a history of mild to moderate exercise intolerance. She has known tricuspid valve regurgitation that is suspected to be worsening. She presents today for evaluation by cardiac MRI to determine the extent of progression and the possibility of surgical correction.
Note: A Danielson type repair is a surgical technique developed by G K Danielson and V Fuster. Included in this technique is plication of the free wall of the atrialized portion of the right ventricle, posterior tricuspid anuloplasty, and right atrial reduction. A monocusp valve is constructed using the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve, which is usually enlarged. Not all patients are candidates for this procedure since the enlarged anterior leaflet is required.
