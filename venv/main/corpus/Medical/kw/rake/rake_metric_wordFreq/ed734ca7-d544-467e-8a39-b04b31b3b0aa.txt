-	abnormal density in the lower right hemithorax with areas of lucency (bowel gas)
-	There is rightward cardiomediastinal shift due to right pulmonary hypoplasia.

Frontal and lateral delayed images of SBFT with contrast administered through a gastric tube.
	-small bowel is seen in the right posterior/lateral hemithorax above the diaphragm.
Recurrent Bochdalek Hernia
-Morgagni hernia (anteromedial herniation)
-Diaphragmatic eventration
Six month old G-tube fed infant with history of right congenital diaphragmatic hernia repaired at birth.  He now presents with episodic abdominal pain.
The most important congenital abnormality of the diaphragm is the posteriorlateral or Bochdalek hernia.   It is the result of incomplete closure of the pleuroperitoneal canal.  Newborns with large hernias usually have severe respiratory distress.  

At first the liver and herniated bowel produce a opaque hemithorax, however, after air is swallowed, gas filled loops of bowel can be seen.  Bochdalek hernias are five times as common on the left side than on the right.  

The morbidity of the Bochdalek hernia is caused by the degree of pulmonary hypoplasia which occurs both contralateral and ipsilateral to the hernia.  Patients always have malrotation and abnormal fixation of bowel.  

Surgical repair is best accomplished with a transabdominal approach using a subcostal incision on the affected side.  This technique facilitates reduction of the viscera into the abdomen and allows lysis of the Ladd bands associated with malrotation if needed.

The recurrence rate after surgical repair is low.
