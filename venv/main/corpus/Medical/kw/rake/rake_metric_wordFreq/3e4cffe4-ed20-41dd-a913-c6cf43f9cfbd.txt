No known abnormalities.
>>Treatment of this patient was unknown. However, usually conventional amphotericin B is still the first-line treatment for patients with invasive aspergillosis.  For patients cured with amphotericin B, secondary prophylaxis is needed at the end of the intravenous therapy (i.e. itraconazole).

>>Recently, it has been noted that the second-generation triazole, voriconazole, was superior to conventional amphotericin B as primary therapy for invasive aspergillosis, and is the new standard of care for this infection.
>>PA chest radiograph was remarkable for the presence of bilateral pulmonary nodules. No mention was made of an air-crescent sign and the patient was sent for follow-up CT scan.

>>CT scan of the chest was notable for a crescent-shaped or circumferential area of radiolucency within a parenchymal consolidation or nodular opacity in thr medical aspect of the right upper lobe.

>>Then upon retrospective anaylysis it was noted that a region of consolidation with the finding of a crescentic lucency was present in the previous chest radiograph.

>>Ground-glass attenuation was also noted within the region of the nodule/consolidation of the right upper lobe. This appearance is consistent with parenchymal hemorrhage.
