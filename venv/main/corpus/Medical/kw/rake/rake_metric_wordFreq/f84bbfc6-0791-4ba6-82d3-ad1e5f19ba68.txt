PE:  Chest: CTA bilaterally
Labs:  elevated D-dimer (1.6), O2 sat=93% on RA
-Anticoagulation therapy
-if patient were unstable: more aggressive therapy such as thrombolysis could be performed
CT (PE/DVT):  Large right main pulmonary artery intraluminal hypodense filling defect.  Additional filling defects in right lung lobar branches.
