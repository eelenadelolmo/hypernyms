Right-sided chest discomfort to palpation.
PA image of the chest demonstrates increased density in soft tissure and subtle bony lytic lesion on right seventh rib. Upon further evaluation, CT images of the chest demonstrate bony destruction of the posterior/lateral aspect of the right seventh rib, with an associated soft tissue mass, which extends into the right lower lobe.

Chondorblastoma
23 y/o female with 6-week history of right sided chest pain.  No history of trauma.
-Radiologic findings:
  Plain radiography is the mainstay in the diagnosis of EG, although a specific diagnosis cannot always be made without bone biopsy because children and adolescents are not spared skeletal neoplasms. Radionuclide study; CT; MRI; and, occasionally, angiography are complementary examinations. Any or all may be used to arrive at a diagnosis.  The ribs show lytic expansile lesions, which may be associated with pathologic fractures.  Lesions are lytic, round or oval, and expansile, with ill-defined or sclerotic margins.  The medullary cavity may be expanded and associated with cortical thinning, intracortical tunneling, and erosion of the cortex and an adjacent soft-tissue mass.  Laminated periosteal new bone formation is common around the involved segment of bone.
	 CT scans may be particularly useful in osseous lesions in areas with complex anatomy, such as the mastoids, atlantoaxial joints, and posterior elements of the vertebral bodies. Also, soft tissue components are better depicted on CT scans than on other images. The destruction of the mastoid, petrous ridge, tegmen tympani, and lateral sinus plate and the destruction of the inner and external ear are depicted elegantly on CT scans. CT may demonstrate an isoattenuating and homogeneously enhancing mass in the hypothalamus/pituitary gland.  CT is considerably better than plain radiography and conventional tomography in depicting an intracranial extension of EG.   CT appearances of EG are nonspecific, and a variety of inflammatory and neoplastic processes may mimic EG.
	On spin-echo MRIs, osseous lesions of EG reveal decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted and high signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences. The lesion may enhance after the administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent.  The value of using MRI to image patients with EG lies in the sensitivity of MRI because its specificity is low. However, the cost of the procedure and the procedural problems encountered in imaging young children confer no advantages over plain radiography.  The soft tissue component around the osseous lesion has poor definition and shows signal inhomogeneity, which may mimic that of a malignant tumor, infection, or stress fracture.
