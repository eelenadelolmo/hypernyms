Endovaginal pelvic sonogram demonstrates a normal uterus and ovaries with an abnormal blind-ending, fluid-filled tubular structure in the right adnexa with peripheral hyperemia.  The patient was tender in this region on sonography.
Followup CT with enteric and intravenous contrast confirms an enlarged, thick-walled appendix with peripheral enhancement and surrounding inflammatory change.  The appendix was low in the pelvis extending into the right adnexal region.
