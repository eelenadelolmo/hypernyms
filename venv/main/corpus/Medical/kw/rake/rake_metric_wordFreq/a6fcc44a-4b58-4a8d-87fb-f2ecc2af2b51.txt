On exam, he was afebrile with stable vital signs.  He was speaking in full sentences without distress, and his pulse oxygen saturation was 90% on 4L oxygen delivered by nasal canula.  

Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the left superior chest.  

He was admitted for further evaluation.
Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed revealing a lobulated “fleshy” obstructing mass in the left mainstem bronchus. Brush biopsies of the mass were taken and revealed squamous cell carcinoma.  The patent was referred to a major lung cancer treatment center for PET/CT imaging, potential resection, and oncologic treatment.
Initial chest radiographs were obtained (figure 1).  The chest radiographs revealed tight left upper lobe collapse - resulting in an abnormal left hilar contour, indistinct left heart border, generalized oligemia in the left chest, and dramatic anterior shift of the left major fissue.
Left upper lobe collapse,  squamous cell carcinoma
Causes for left upper lobe collapse:
Obstructing mass (lung cancer)
Mucus plugging
Bronchial foreign body
An 83-year-old male smoker, COPD on 2L home oxygen, presents to the emergency department with worsening dyspnea on exertion.  He had a mild dry cough with an 8 lb weight loss over the past month with no change in appetite.  He reported no history of fevers or chills.
Left upper lobe (LUL) collapse can be a difficult diagnosis to recognize on frontal chest radiographs.  Careful attention to asymmetric lung volumes (smaller in the left chest), elevataion of the left diaphragm, indistinct left heart border (due to lingular atelectasis), and a "mass-like" opacity in the left hilar region are all key findings.  When LUL collapse is severe, a lateral CXR is helpful in identifying an anteriorly-positioned left lung minor fissure.  The "luftsichel" sign refers to a distinctly sharp appearance of the aortic arch due to a hyperinflated left lower lobe outlining the arch.  Failure to recognize these findings may result in delay in diagnosis, with lung cancer (typically squamous cell carcinoma) being the diagnosis of most concern.
