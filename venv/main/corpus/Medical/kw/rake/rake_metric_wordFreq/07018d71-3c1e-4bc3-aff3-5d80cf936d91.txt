If the findings of AVN are found early enough this can be treated with an abduction brace to keep the femoral head directed at the acetabulum in hopes of attaining a more concentric remineralization of the femoral head and acetabulum.  This childs case is more advanced in that the femoral head is sclerotic and collapsed.
The right femoral epiphysis is sclerotic and collapsed.  The remainder of the bones appear normal.
Legg-Calve-Perthes
Legg-Calve-Perthes disease
Secondary AVN of the femoral head due to an underlying condition such as sickle cell disease or Gaucher disease.
7 year old male with right hip pain of unknown duration.  No known significant past medical history.
early radiographic findings are of osteopenia due to disuse.  Later there is apparent joint space widening due to soft tissue edema. this is followed by subchondral fracture and eventual sclerosis and collapse. This childs case is more advanced in that the femoral head is sclerotic and collapsed.
