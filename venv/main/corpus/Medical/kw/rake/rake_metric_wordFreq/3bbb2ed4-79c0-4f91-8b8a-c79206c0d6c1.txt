Medical management of cardiovascular risk factors and consideration of revascularization of the infarcted region.
Subendocardial hyperenhancement on mycardial delayed enhancement (MDE) imaging in the anterior and anterioseptal wall of the left ventricle consistent with myocardial infarction.  Normal T2W signal suggests the lack of edema and this to be a chronic myocardial infarction (vs. acute myocardial infarction).
