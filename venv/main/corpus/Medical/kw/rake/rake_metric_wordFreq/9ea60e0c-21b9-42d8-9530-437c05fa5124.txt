His physical exam is non-contributory except for the left arm exam.  No deformity is apparent and skin is intact.  He has extreme pain to palpation of the left upper extremity.  Passive and active shoulder, elbow and wrist ROM are WNL and only limited by the aforementioned pain.  Pt has no neurovascular deficits in the ipsilateral elbow or wrist.
Closed reduction and immobilization x 6-8 weeks.  Follow-up x-ray at 2 and 4 weeks.  Possibly radiographs of the right humerus and both femurs to look for other unicameral bone cysts.
Anteroposterior radiograph of the left humerus shows a fiberglass cast around the left humerus.  There is an oblique fracture through a radiolucent bone cyst of the left humerus at the junction between the proximal and mid diaphysis with approximately 4 mm of medial displacement and slight dorsal angulation.  The cyst measures  1.9 X 4.2 cm in dimensions.
Unicameral bone cyst with associated pathological fracture
Unicameral bone cyst with associated pathological fracture
13 year old boy presents to ER with 9/10 left upper arm pain that occurred suddenly while playing catch with his father.  The pain is localized, does not radiate, and is characterized as constant without relief.  Patient denies any parathesia, loss of strength, function, or sensation.
Unicameral bone cysts (UBC) are  common benign fluid-filled radiolucent lesions, usually of unknown origin, found almost exclusively in children (skeletally immature) and usually presents as unifocal osteolytic lesions in either the proximal humerus or proximal femur.  Most are found in the second decade with a 2:1 male predominance.  The rarity of the lesion in adults supports a hypothesis of spontaneous resolution. In the absence of a fracture through the cyst, UBCs are generally asymptomatic, and no treatment may be necessary other than observation.  A UBC is not considered to be a malignant or premalignant lesion, and part of the category of "do not touch" bone lesions unless fractured or significantly symptomatic. However, if there is any doubt about the diagnosis aspiration and cytology can be done.
Most patients with a UBC present to the orthopedic surgeon after sustaining a pathologic fracture, which is thought to occur in approximately 66% of patients with UBC. Such fractures most commonly involve either the proximal humerus or the proximal femur. The events leading up to the fracture may vary from mild exertion, such as throwing a ball, to more substantial activity, such as a falling hard while playing soccer. As with all patients who have sustained a fracture, a careful physical examination of the patient should include efforts to exclude the possibility of open fracture and neurovascular insult.  
Tx: Nonoperative treatment of UBCs usually is closed fracture immobility through the pathologic fracture. Some newer operative treatments include: 25 cc of autologous bone marrow, taken from the patient’s iliac crest   and injection into the bone cyst.  Other proposed treatments are curettage and injection of bone chips or methylprednisolone into the bone cyst.
