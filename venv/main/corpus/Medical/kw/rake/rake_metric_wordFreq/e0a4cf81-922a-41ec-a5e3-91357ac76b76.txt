Orthopedic consultation.
Radiograph of bilateral knees demonstrates subtle lucency in the right femoral head. A focal calcific fragment is present in the lateral joint space. It is difficult to determine whether this represents intracapsular loose body or soft tissue calcification overlying joint. It is visualized on one view only. A small joint effusion is present.

Axial CT performed the following day demonstrates comminuted fracture of the medial femoral condyle. A small joint effusion is present.
Comminuted fracture of medial femoral condyle.
Small joint effusion.
Fracture fragment from osteochondral injury.
Free fragment in knee joint.
Overlying soft tissue calcification
Patient had outpatient radiograph with history of knee pain. No other information provided. Patient was ambulatory with no evidence of gait disturbance according to technician who performed radiographs.
See Factoid.
Interesting case as patient was ambulatory with very few symptoms. Patient also had a small effusion which is uncommon in someone with such a severe injury. Follow-up history was patient fell off back of troop truck (7 1/2 ton) and "bruised knee" 3 days prior to radiograph.
