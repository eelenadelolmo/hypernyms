Large mass at left cheek with pain and swelling.
Surgical excision with wide free margins.
Planned reconstruction.
Recurrence is common and therefore follow up is required.
• 6.7 cm x 5.2 cm expansile unilocular cystic/solid lesion in the body of the mandible at the left lower third molar.

• Marked thinning of cortical margins and focal dehiscence.

• No soft tissue infiltration or invasion.

• Minimal tooth displacement from mandible without resorption.
Ameloblastoma
Mandibular Cyst and Odontogenic Tumors.

• Odontogenic tumors
 -Ameloblastoma
 -Odontogenic Myxoma
 -Odontoma

• Odontogenic mandibular cysts
 -Periapical (radicular) Cyst
 -Dentigerous Cyst
 -Odontogenic Keratocyst

• Nonodontogenic mandibular cysts
 -Stafne Bone Cyst
 -Traumatic Bone Cyst
