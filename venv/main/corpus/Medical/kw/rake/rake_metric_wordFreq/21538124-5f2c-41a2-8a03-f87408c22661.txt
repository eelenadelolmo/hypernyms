No treatment has been shown to prevent or delay the Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease process.  Strict blood pressure regulation may reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
Statins should also be used for patients with hyperlipidemia and reduced kidney function.  Chronic pain control and treatment of recurrent infections are essential.  Ultimately, dialysis or renal transplant will be required for patients who progress to end-stage renal disease.
The right kidney is absent.  The left kidney is markedly enlarged with too numerous to count cysts of varying sizes.  There is no hydronephrosis. Several scattered calcifications are present within the left kidney.  There is a 1.7 x 1.7 rounded hyperdense nodule within the lateral aspect of this kidney.

Changes of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, with multiple cysts seen in the native left kidney, the liver, and the pancreatic head.

The transplanted kidney located in the left lower quadrant is noted, without hydronephrosis or mass lesion.
