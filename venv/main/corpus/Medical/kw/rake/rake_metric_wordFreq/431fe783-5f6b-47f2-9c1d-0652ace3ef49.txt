No treatment required. Follow up is controversial. No conclusive evidence for association with increased carcinogenesis.
Small nonshadowing hyperechoic foci ranging in diameter from 1 to 3 mm. 
These occur within the testicular parenchyma but may be distributed peripherally or segmentally. 
Testicular microlithiasis usually occurs bilaterally. More than five foci in one imaging plane are required for diagnosis.
