• Elevated liver enzymes;
• Elevated total bilirubin;
+ perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA)
Medications for itching and infection; vitamin supplements for nutritional deficiency; the patient is awaiting liver transplant.
Contast-enhanced axial CT image demonstrates nodular appearance of the surface of the liver, atrophy of the lateral and posterior segments, hypertrophy of the caudate lobe, and overall rounded appearance to the liver, all concerning for cirrhosis.  The spleen is enlarged.  There is thickening of the wall of the colon.  MRCP image (obtained 5 years earlier)demonstrates a beaded appearance to the intrahepatic ducts.
