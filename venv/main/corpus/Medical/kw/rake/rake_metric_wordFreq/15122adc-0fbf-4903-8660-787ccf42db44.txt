Back: Mild tenderness to palpation over lower thoracic/upper lumbar spine. 

CSF: LP opening pressure: 18 cm H2O, wbc=32,rbc=2, glc=53, prtn=92 76%lymphs. Gram stain: pmns present. no organisms. 

CBC: 5.68>10.6/31.6<443 

CMP: 140/4.4/99/29/11/0.5<95, Ca 9.6, PO4 4.8, Mg 1.6
Pt started on 6 week course of florquinalone antibiotic therapy and discharged to outpatient care with a back brace.
-Plain radiograph one week later showed decreased disk space between T10-T11 

-On fat-suppressed MRI (STIR and FSE T2-weighted with fat sat MRI), high-signal -ntensity mass anterior to thoracic vertebrae, high signal intensity in the disc space and in the thoracic vertebrae at this level are consistent with infection. These areas enhance after contrast on the contrast-enhanced fat-saturated  T1-weighted MR images.

52 y/o AA male recently deployed soldier who was medically evacuated due to chronic back pain that interfered with his duties as a truckdriver. While being evaluated stateside his pain worsened and he developed altered mental status, prompting a lumbar puncture which revealed signs consistent with a potential infection. An MRI was then obtained for further evalutaion.
The specific cause or underlying condition leading to the development of discitis in this patient is unclear.  Most cases of discitis show increased signal intensity on T2WI MRI within 48 hours of presentation and the course of infection typically moves anterior to posterior as seen with this patient, ultimately moving posterior until the spinal cord was involved.

The diagnosis of Pott's Disease was considered in the differential diagnosis; however, the unremarable CT obtained one month prior suggests against a tuberculosis infection due to the historically slower progression of disease seen with Pott's.  

Metastatic bone lesions were also considered; however, were less likely due to the rare incidence of intramedullary involvement and the involvement of the disc space.

MRI is considered the best method for diagnosing disc space infection with a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 94%.
