Physical exam:
Nonpalpable, nontender thyroid gland.

Labs:
TSH of 0.08 uIU/ML, and free T4 of 63.8 pmol/l.  

The 25-hr RAIU =  0.9 % (Normal 8 - 30%).
Amiodarone was discontinued and methimazole was initiated.
Absent uptake within the thyroid and decreased 24-hour radioactive iodine uptake.  Findings consistent with amiodarone induced hyperthyroidism.
Amiodarone Induced Thyroiditis
-Subacute thyroiditis
-Factitious Hyperthyroidism (Thyroid hormone Supplementation)
-Struma Ovari (Ovarian Carcinoma)
-Jod Basedow phenomenon
90 year old female with history of tremors, lower extremity edema and insomnia.  She has a history of hyperthyroidism and amiodarone use.
Two types of hyperthyroidism related to amiodarone may occur.  Type I (iodine-induced hyperthyroidism) and Type II (destructive thyrotoxicosis).  Type I often has low RAIU (but the RAIU may be normal or rarely elevated); and this type often responds to antithyroid medications.  Type II always presents with low RAIU and is typically responsive to glucocorticoids.
