Patient had subsequent resection of the hypothalamic mass.  Although the path report cannot be found in CHCS, subsequent imaging history states that patient is status post resection of Hypothalamic Hamartoma.
Multi-sequence, multi-planar MRI demonstrates a suprasellar mass that is well-defined, rounded in shape, and iso-intense to gray-matter on all pulse sequences.  The mass does not enhance after administration of gadolinium DTPA.
