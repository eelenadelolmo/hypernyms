Vital Signs after volume resuscitation and prior to CT study: Temp 98.5 F, HR 120, BP 160/90, O2 sats 97%.

Non-responsive, pale, debilitated woman.

Multiple hematomas on abdominal wall in a pattern suggestive of multiple enoxaparin injections.  Obese abdomen, no focal findings on exam.

Chronically ventilated through tracheostomy.

Initial Hgb of 5.1, INR 2.33, WBCs 14, BUN 33, Cr 1.3.
The treatment of choice for this condition is surgical decompression.  If not performed, mortality is 100%. Estimates of mortality S/P decompression range from 40-100%.
-Elevated diaphragm
-Large left abdominal wall hematoma
-Large pelvic accumulation of heterogeneous fluid, suggestive of blood
-Flattened IVC
-Flattened renal veins
-Heterogeneous appearance of liver
-Barium contrast in colon from upper GI done approx 5 days prior to this study

This 74 yo woman is a patient being transferred from a long-term hospital to an ICU secondary to severe acute anemia diagnosed by her daily blood tests.
As mentioned in the discussion of radiological findings in abdominal compartment syndrome, there is nothing specific to hold onto.  As is typical, this case is challenging/unreliable to solve by radiology alone because the compression of the IVC and renal veins would seem to correlate appropriately from the large volume of blood lost in the hemorrhage that you are drawn to.  However, knowing that the patient is hypertensive at the time of the imaging study in a 74 year old chronically debilitated individual should suggest the possibility of another source of venous flattening (if she were severely septic or dehydrated, her pressure would not be 160/90).  On a side note, compressed renal veins and IVC should always be reported with mention that increased intra-abdominal pressure is on the differential because it represents a major change in management for the clinician if present (and it's quick and easy to rule out).  In this case, the flattened vessels are a result of the acute blood accumulation in the peritoneal cavity (a closed system with no way to decompress itself) and pelvis.  ACS is defined as intra-abdominal pressure of >20 + evidence of organ failure.  This patient's intra-abdominal pressure was 37.  

Otherwise, this is a somewhat textbook example demonstrating almost all the known ACS radiological findings with a common source: an intra-abdominal hemorrhage.
