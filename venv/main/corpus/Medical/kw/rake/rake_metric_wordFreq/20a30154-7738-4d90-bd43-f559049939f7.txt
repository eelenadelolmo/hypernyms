Patient was treated with low molecular weight heparin.  Follow-up CT performed 2 months later showed complete resolution of all findings.
Contrast enhanced CT images show low density filling defects in the right inferior lobar pulmonary artery extending into multiple segmental branches of the right lower lobe.  Wedge-shaped consolidation involves the posterior segment of the right lower lobe, best appreciated on lung window.  A small right pleural effusion is also present.  Selected CT venogram image from the same study shows enlargement of the left greater saphenous vein with a central low density filling defect.
Pulmonary Thromboembolism
None applicable.
42 year old female with initial presentation of right sided abdominal pain with subsequent development of subjective shortness of breath.
The patient in this case originally underwent abdominal CT for investigation of her right abdominal pain.  No abdominal etiology was apparent, however, the possibility of right lower lobe PE was suggested, based on a single image through the lung base.  At that time, there was no pleural effusion or consolidation.

The patient underwent subsequent ultrasound evaluation of the lower extremity deep venous structures (common femoral through popliteal veins) which was normal.

The next day, this patient underwent the CT pulmonary angiogram shown in this case, now convincingly showing the pulmonary arterial thrombus.  The pleural effusion and consolidation were interval developments since the original abdominal CT.  This rapid development supports the assumption of pulmonary infarct—the CT equivalent of a Hampton’s hump.  Unfortunately, chest radiographs were never obtained (a common occurrence at our institution).

It is uncommon for a significant pulmonary embolism to be the product of superficial venous thrombosis.  While this case shows thrombus in the left greater saphenous vein, it is not possible to determine exactly where the clot in the lungs originated from.  Most probably, it was once located in the deep venous structures of the left leg, with concurrent thrombosis of the GSV.  On the other hand, perhaps this is a truly unusual case of PE generated from a superficial source.
