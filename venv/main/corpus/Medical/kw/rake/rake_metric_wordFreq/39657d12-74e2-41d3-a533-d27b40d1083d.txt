Cardiorespiratory arrest.  Distended abdomen.
Frontal radiograph of the chest and abdomen shows extensive free intraperitoneal air.  Visible signs include "football", "Rigler's", "cupola" or "continuous diaphragm", "falciform ligament", "lucent/double density liver", and "inverted V."  There are multiple tubes and lines along with opacification in the left mid lung.
Pneumoperitoneum secondary to gastric perforation.
Perforated viscus
4 month old girl presented to the ED in cardiorespiratory arrest.
The patient's arrest was most likely secondary to compromise resulting from extensive pneumoperitoneum limiting pulmonary expansion and venous return.  Exceptionally high pressures were required to ventilate this patient prior to laparotomy.  The cause of gastric perforation is uncertain at present.
