Texto: 
The patient was treated with antibiotics and drainage of the lesion.  Serial US exams demonstrate thickening/fibrosis of the abscess wall over time with decrease in overall size.  The patient continues to show gradual clinical improvement.  Treatment of pyogenic liver abscess typically requires drainage and 4-6 weeks of IV antibiotics.
CT imaging demonstrates large cystic structure with area of low attenuation centrally and apparent fluid level, with a discrete, enhancing wall.  US demonstrates a thickened, irregular wall with central area of heterogeneous echogenicity, representing the liquefaction of the abscess.
Hepatic Abscess
Abscess (bacterial,amebic,fungal)
Neoplasm with central necrosis
Other cystic lesion (cystadenoma, cystadenocarcinoma)
1 month old premature female with onset of sepsis and thrombocytopenia shortly after birth, following umbilical vein catheterization.
Cases of hepatic abscesses in neonates have been associated with complications from umbilical vein catheterization or necrotizing enterocolitis.  It was suspected that the abscess in this patient was a result of complications from umbilical vein catheterization.
