Comatose with GCS  score of 5
Evaculation of hematoma with resection of AVM
• CT Large left hemisphere hematoma - fronto-temporal-parietal
• CTA shows several dilated vessels surrounding the hematoma
Ruptured Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM)
• Ruptured AVM
• Traumatic hemorrhage
• Aneurysm hemorrhage
• Hemorrhage into a neoplasm (GBM or metastasis, oligo, etc.)
Previously healthy 31 year old man brought to the ER with a history of an altercation 2 hours prior to admission.
This previously asymptomatic man presented with coma after an "altercation".  The coma is due to a combination of increased intracranial pressure from the mass lesion - an expanding hematoma - and brain herniation (under the falx and also downward through the tentorial hiatus.   The hemorrhage is most likely from his pre-existing AVM, they are congenital lesoins, after an altercation.  The rupture of the AVM might be the result of mechanical trauma and/or the "situational hypertension" during the fight.
