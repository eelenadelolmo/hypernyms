Intramedulary nail placed in both femurs. Pt. receiving radiation therapy for extensive bone mets in the hips. She has been started on chemotherapy to reduce size of breast lesion with the ultimate goal of resection.
• Right Hip and Pelvis Radiographs
1) Within the subtrochanteric region of the right femur, there is a lucent slightly expansile lesion with sclerotic margins. A pathologic fracture is evident through the lesion.
2) Proximal left hip shows a lucent lesion.

• Chest Radiograph
1) There  is  a  large  mass  in  the  left  breast  along  with  marked  swelling  in  the  left  axillary  region.

CT Chest 
1) large mass centered in the patient's left breast measuring approximately 16.2 x 11.1 cm in cross-section.
2) Axillary adenopathy measuring approximately 6.1 x 6.0 cm.
Pathologic Fracture, Metastatic disease
1) Metatstatic lesions, breast cancer primary
2) Multiple myeloma, plasmacytoma in breast
This 64 y.o. woman slipped on her bathroom floor at home and fell on her right side.   She reports 10/10 pain on the right side, radiating down her right lower extremity.   Pt. denied CP, SOB, or LOC. She also acknowledges a left breast mass, present for two years; and, a significant weight loss over the past 4 months.
Epithelial malignancies of the breast are the most common form of non-skin cancers in females and account for about one-third of all cancers in women. It is second only to lung cancer as the most common cause of death. 

Risk factors for the development of breast cancer include a family history (including BRCA gene), nulliparity, and first pregnancy past the age of 35. Early menarche or late menopause are believed to slightly increase risk. Seventy-five percent of women, however, have no known identifiable risk factors. 

Breast cancer screening by way of mammography has been proven to decrease mortality / increase survival. Routine annual mammography is recommended for women over the age of 40. When symptomatic, a diagnostic breast imaging workup must ensure.  The presenting complaint (in approximately 70% of diagnostic cases) is breast pain with an associated lump. Back or bone pain, jaundice, or weight loss are worrisome systemic symptoms that may be caused by metastatses, but are rarely the initial complaint. (1)

Infiltrating ductal carcinoma is one of the more common diagnoses, and when metastatic disease ensues it most commonly involve the lungs, pleura, liver, and brain. Infiltrating lobular carcinoma may metastatize to unusual sites such as the bone marrow, meninges, peritoneum, and retroperitoneal structures, such as the ureters. (2)

Treatment typically consists of surgical removal of the breast mass via either lumpectomy or mastectomy, axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy, and post-op radiation/chemotherapy to reduce risk of recurrence. The most important prognostic factors are the size of the original tumor and amount of axillary lymph node involvement. (3)
