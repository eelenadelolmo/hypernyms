Severe thoracic scoliosis
Othopedic following for thoracic scoliosis
Right paravertebral soft tissue density which demonstrates significant enhancement and extension into the adjacent neuroforamina.  MRI demonstrates increased signal on T2 as well as enhancement with gadoliniium.  There is also a suggestion of a second left sided paraspnal mass.  MRI of the brain demonstrate areas of increased signal on T2 consistent with NF1.
Neurofibromatosis-1, NF1, NF-1
neuroblastoma
gangioneuroblastoma
2 year old child with worsening thoracic scoliosis
Bilateral paraspinal plexifrom neurofibromas are virtually diagnostic of NF1.  The areas of increased signal on T2 MRI are usually seenwithin the deep grey matter, brain stem or cerebellar peduncles, as in this patient.
