-Extensive cervical lymphadenopathy, left much greater than right.  
-Reports no "B" symptoms.
-FNA showed atypical cells and numerous lymphocytes.  Subsequent core biopsy revealed classic Hodgkin’s Lymphoma of the mixed cellularity type.
Chemotherapy and radiation with follow up CT scans to evaluate response. F/U FDG PET would be of little value.
CT of the Neck:  There is prominent adenopathy in the cervical region.  The largest is the left jugulo-digastic node, measuring 2.2 x 2.4 cm.  There is a prominent chain of nodes extending inferiorly.  Another prominent node is at the level of the hyoid bone measuring 1.4 x 1.5 cm.  More caudad, near the thoracic inlet, is another large node measuring 2.1 x 1.8 cm.  There are multiple smaller scattered nodes bilaterally, left more than right.

FDG-PET: Delayed magnified views of the cervical region demonstrate only two discrete foci of mildly elevated FDG accumulation in the left neck.  Maximum SUV in these two foci is only 1.6.  The PET scan findings do not correlate with the extent of disease seen on the CT scan (performed separately, but on the same day).  This is indicative of a minimally FDG- avid form of Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
Hodgkin's disease (mixed cellularity), minimally FDG-avid.

-Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

-Reactive Lymphadenopathy
