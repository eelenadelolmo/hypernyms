The origin of the left coronary artery is demonstrated
arising anomalously from the left pulmonary artery. Contrast in the right coronary artery is as dense as the aorta where it originates and the lower density of the left coronary corresponds with the lower density of the pulmonary artery from which it originates. Severe cardiomegaly is
demonstrated with left ventricular enlargement and small pericardial
effusion.
ALCAPA, Bland White Garland Syndrome
Viral pericarditis vs congenital heart anomaly vs dilated cardiomyopathy
Two month old female presents for well child check and is transferred to ER with respiratory distress, grunting, poor weight gain, hypoxia, and low O2 saturation
Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), also known as Bland-White-Garland syndrome, is a rare but serious congenital cardiac anomaly. The ALCAPA anomaly may result from (1) abnormal septation of the conotruncus into the aorta and pulmonary artery, or from (2) persistence of the pulmonary buds together with involution of the aortic buds that eventually form the coronary arteries. ALCAPA is usually an isolated cardiac anomaly but, in rare incidences, has been described with patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect, tetrology of Fallot, and coarctation of the aorta. 

The pathophysiology behind ALCAPA stems from chronic myocardial ischemia leading to the combination of left ventricular dysfunction and significant mitral valve insufficiency, which eventually presents as congestive heart failure (CHF) symptoms (eg, tachypnea, poor feeding, irritability, diaphoresis) in the young infant. ALCAPA is undetected in utero because the fetus benefits from the favorable fetal physiology that includes (1) equivalent pressures in the main pulmonary artery and aorta secondary to a nonrestrictive patent ductus arteriosus, and (2) relatively similar oxygen concentrations due to parallel circulations. After birth, pulmonary artery pressure/resistance and oxygen content of the pulmonary blood flow both decrease. This leads to myocardial ischemia due to the left ventricle being perfused by desaturated blood under low pressure. Initially there is only a transient demand ischemia, but eventually collateral circulation between the right and left coronary systems ensues. This leads to left coronary artery flow reversing and entering the pulmonic trunk due to the low pulmonary vascular resistance (coronary steal phenomena). [1]

The etiology of ALCAPA is not considered an inheritable congenital cardiac defect . The condition is generally considered to be on the basis of multi factorial inheritance, similar to other congenital heart defects. In utero exposure to teratogens, chromosomal abnormalities, or other risk factors are unrelated to ALCAPA. Other congenital cardiac defects, such as patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, or coarctation of the aorta, rarely may be associated with ALCAPA. No specific association with any noncardiac anomalies is noted. ALCAPA has no race or gender predilectation. [2]

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare, congenital cardiac anomaly accounting for approximately 0.25-0.5% of all congenital heart disease. [3] If left untreated however, the mortality rate in the first year of life is 90% secondary to myocardial ischemia or infarction and mitral valve insufficiency leading to CHF. Sudden death may occur because of inadequate collateral circulation between the left and right coronary artery systems and/or development of arrhythmia. Early diagnosis using echocardiography with color flow mapping and improvements in surgical techniques (eg, myocardial preservation) dramatically improve prognosis.

A high index of suspicion is necessary to make the diagnosis of ALCAPA, as surgical treatment is extremely successful and results in an excellent long-term prognosis. The most serious, yet avoidable, complication is the mistaking of symptoms in the patient older than several months who presents with anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) as idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or end stage myocarditis. The initial presentation may be entirely similar but the treatments are dramatically different. The clinical and initial laboratory findings may be remarkably similar. For those reasons, careful definition of the origin of the coronary arteries by echo-Doppler ultrasonographic studies in every patient presenting with the above clinical scenario should be undertaken.
