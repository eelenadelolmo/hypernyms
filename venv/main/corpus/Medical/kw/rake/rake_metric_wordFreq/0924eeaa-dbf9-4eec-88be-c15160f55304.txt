Nontender lump felt over the right mid-clavicular region. Physical exam was otherwise WNL.
Treatment: orthopedic surgical repair with excision pseudoarthrosis, with bone grafting and plating of right clavicle. Plate and screws ultimately failed with recurrent pseudoarthrosis. Patient underwent surgical removal of implants, with resection of pseudarthrosis of right clavicle and then open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). She also had bone grafting and insertion of bone morphogenic protein. 

Follow-up:  patient had an uneventful hospital course and surgical repair has been stable without further complications.
Clavicular CR showed a 1  cm  deficiency  in  the midportion  of  the  right clavicle.  The  clavicular  ends  are  slightly  bulbous  but appear  to  be  well  marginated. This was thought to be a congenital defect and a CT scan was ordered for further evaluation.
CT showed a bipartiteright  clavicle  with  no  evidence  of  an  associated soft tissue  mass  or developing  callus.
Orthopedic surgical repair was done with plate and screws, then removal of plate and screws with placement of a threaded screw through the clavicle. 
F/u images show stable placement of threaded screw.
Congenital Pseudoarthrosis of the Clavicle
Differential Diagnosis for Imaging Findings of Pseudoarthrosis in Long Bones:
*Nonunion of fracture
*Neurofibromatosis Type 1, seen in the tibia
*Fibrous dysplasia
*Congenital pseudarthrosis of the clavicle 
*Osteogenesis imperfecta
*Cleidocranial dysplasia (dysostosis) may have an appearance similar to congenital pseudoarthrosis of the clavicle
Patient presents with lump felt by parent over the right clavicle. There is no history of trauma or pain in the area.
This is a classic presentation of congential pseudoarthrosis of the clavicle. The patient presented with painless lump overlying the right clavicle with no history of trauma, fracture, birthing complications, or neurofibromatosis. The imaging showed classic findings of separation and rounded appearance of the medial and lateral clavicle segments with no evidence of callous formation.
