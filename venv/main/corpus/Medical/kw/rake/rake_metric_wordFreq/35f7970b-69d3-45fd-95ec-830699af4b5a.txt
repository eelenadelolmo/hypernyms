Age appropriate vital signs. Typical Down’s facies, macrocephalic with large open bulging anterior fontanelle with prominent scalp veins, moves all extremities well and equally.  PERRL, normal suck and grasp reflexes.
Complete resection of the mass was accomplished. This patient has since had quarterly MRIs, which have not shown any recurrence.
US Brain:  5cm solid and cystic mass with areas of suggesting calcification and increased vascularity

MRI Brain- Heterogeneous, lobulated mass measuring approximately 5.7cm x 6.2cm x 6.5cm that contains cystic regions and regions of hyper and hypointensity on T1 and T2 sequences.  The mass is surrounded by edema in the right temporal, right frontal, and right parietal lobes. It is difficult to determine the origin of the mass but it does extend into the right lateral ventricle causing enlargement. There is marked enlargement of the ventricles.
Intracranial Immature Brain Teratoma
• Intracranial (brain) Teratoma
• Ependymoma
• Astrocytoma
• Choroid Plexus Carcinoma
• Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor
5 week old baby girl with known Trisomy 21.  She has one week of increasing head circumference, widening calvarial sutures, and increasingly prominent scalp veins.
In the first few months after birth, the most common intracranial masses include teratoma, choroid plexus papilloma (which would be intraventricular), and PNET (primitive neuroectodermal tumor).
