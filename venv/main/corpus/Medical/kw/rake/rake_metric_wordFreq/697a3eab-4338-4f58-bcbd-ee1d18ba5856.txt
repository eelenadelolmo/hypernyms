Texto: 
Normal overall renal function as measured by serum creatinine.  No UTI.  

VCUG performed demonstrated left-sided ureterocele with no vesicoureteral reflux.  

MAG-3 nuclear medicine exam demonstrated no function of the upper pole of the left kidney, but overall normal renal function.
Surgcial resection as above
Sonographic images demonstrate a duplex left kidney with marked hydronephrosis of the upper pole, resulting in cortical thinning.  Dilated proximal and distal ureter noted, especially at its insertion into the posterior wall of the bladder.  Ectopic ureterocele noted on sagittal and transverse imaging of the bladder.

Post-op images demonstrate foreshortend left kidney, status post resection of left upper pole.  Minimal pelviectasis remains.  Post-op images of the bladder demosntrate normal appearance without ureterocele.
Duplex Kidney with Ectopic Ureterocele
Neonatal boy with hydronephrosis noted on prenatal ultrasound exam.  Post-natal ultrasound demonstrated hydronephrotic left renal upper pole with cortical thinning and dilated upper pole ureter.  Insonation of the bladder demonstrated left-sided ureterocele with dilated distal ureter, consistent with ectopic ureterocele.
Duplex collecting system with ectopic ureterocele following the Weigert-Meyer rule that the upper pole moiety ureter inserts ectopically, infero-medial to the usual site, and tends to obstruct.  Lower pole moiety inserts orthotopically and is prone to reflux, although not in this case, perhaps as a result of early intervention.
