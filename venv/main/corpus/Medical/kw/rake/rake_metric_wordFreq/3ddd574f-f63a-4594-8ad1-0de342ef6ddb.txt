15 year old Hispanic female, G0 P0 with chief complaint of right lower quadrant pain. She complained of intermittent RLQ pain for the past year and a half, with a previous hospital admission 6 months prior for the same symptoms. Pain was worst on the day of present admission, which coincided with the first day of her menstrual period.
