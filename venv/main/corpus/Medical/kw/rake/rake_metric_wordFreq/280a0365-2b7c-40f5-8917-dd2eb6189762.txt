N/A
Depends on symptoms,  Medical acid reducing agents, endoscopic treatment (dilatation).
-Smooth, tapering stricture at the distal esophagus just above GE juction.  -Stricture is less than 12.5 mm in diameter as proven by inability of barium tablet to pass.
Peptic stricture
1)Benign stricture- peptic stricture in this case given known history. (also caustic ingestion, e.g. lye)
2)Malignant neoplasm--very unlikely given appearance (see below)
27 y/o male with dysphagia and occasional regurgitation.  

PMH:  prior history of esophageal stricture and esophageal dilatation.
Features of Benign and Malignant strictures:

Benign:  Smooth, regular, tapering.  No shoulders or irregular ulceration.

Malignant:  Irregular and fixed, sharply demarcated filling defects with overhanging edges (shoulders), assoc irregular ulceration, eccentric in nature
