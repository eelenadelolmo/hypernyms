Well circumscribed mass in the suprasellar cistern with T1 and T2 hyperintensity.  No enhancement is noted on the post-Gadolinium T1 images.  The gradient-echo sequence demonstrates suppression of the lesion and if one looks carefully, a chemical-shift artifact is noted on the T2 sequences.
Suprasellar Cistern Lipoma
Rathke Cleft Cyst
Craniopharyngioma
Lipoma
Dermoid
Epidermoid
11 year old girl with incidental finding from an outside institution's Ct of the brain.
While all of the items in the differential diagnosis are possibilities, the complete homogenous fat saturation on the GRE sequence and the chemical shift artifact in multiple planes lead to the diagnosis of a lipoma.
