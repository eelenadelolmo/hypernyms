Range of motion is limited to 120 degrees without pain.  Tenderness to palpation with patellar compression and along the medial jointlines bilaterally.
There is bilateral symmetric narrowing of the joint spaces with sclerotic changes of the subchondral tibial plateaus.  There are tibial and patellar osteophytes bilaterally and a large quadriceps enthesophyte of the right patella.  There is bilateral calcification of the menisci.  There are bilateral fabellae.  A dystrophic calcification of the superficial tissues overlying the left popliteal fossa is noted.  There is calcification of the right superficial femoral to popliteal artery and of the left popliteal artery.
Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease
The differential diagnosis for the chondrocalcinosis seen in this case can be remembered by the mnemonic "HOGWASH." Hyperparathyroidism, Ochronosis (alkaptonuria), Gout, Wilson's disease, Arthritides (any), (P)Seudogout: CPPD, and Hemochromatosis.  Of the entities associated with chondrocalcinosis CPPD is by far the most common to affect the medial and lateral compartments of the knee.

Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease is the most common crystal arthropathy. It usually affects middle-aged and elderly patients. The estimated frequency in this population is five percent. Patients affected with CPPD deposition disease have a clinical picture that varies from asymptomatic joint disease to the pseudogout syndrome (arthralgia simulating that seen in gout). 

CPPD crystal deposition into fibrous and/or hyaline cartilage is termed chondrocalcinosis. The crystals may also deposit in synovial capsules, tendons, and ligaments. Two diseases that have significant association with CPPD crystal deposition are hemochromatosis and primary hyperparathyroidism. It has occasionally been associated with gout, diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. It also commonly is idiopathic. 

Chondrocalcinosis is seen most frequently in the knee, hand, and pubic symphysis. At least one of these three areas is involved in patients with CPPD deposition disease. It may also involve the shoulder, elbow, foot, and spine. The most frequent areas of involvement, in decreasing order of frequency, are the knees, hands, and hips. Characteristically, there can be isolated involvement of the patellofemoral joint in the knee. Occasionally, the changes in the knee may be so severe as to resemble neuropathic arthropathy. In the hand, chondrocalcinosis is noted most frequently in the triangular fibrocartilage. In addition, calcification of the hyaline cartilage between the lunate and navicular is characteristic; this can lead to scapholunate dissociation with accompanying narrowing of the joint space between the lunate and capitate (the "stepladder" configuration). 

The arthropathy in CPPD depostion disease is usually confined to the MCP joints, differentiating it from primary osteoarthritis. In the hip, commonly there is calcification of the fibrocartilage of the anterior labrum and of the hyaline cartilage paralleling the femoral head, often leading to uniform cartilage loss and resultant axial migration of the femoral head. In the foot, the arthropathy preferentially affects the talonavicular joint. 

Radiographically, the arthropathy of CPPD deposition disease resembles osteoarthritis. However, the distribution within the skeleton as well as within the specific joint is distinctive from primary osteoarthritis. The radiographic features of CPPD depostion disease are as follows: (1) chondrocalcinosis; (2) normal mineralization; (3) uniform joint space loss (4) subchondral new bone formation; (5) variable osteophyte formation (6) cysts (more prominent than in osteoarthritis) (7) occasional neuropathic changes (8) bilateral distribution.
