An extensive physical examination is unnecessary because the radiograph provides a definitive diagnosis.  After diagnosis there are a number of stability and "apprehension" tests that can help guide therapy and monitor improvement in shoulder joint stability.
Typically, treatment is physical therapy to strengthen the muscles of the rotator cuff and should girdle.  Occasionally surgery is recommended in young patients, especially after the first dislocation.  Early surgical intervention may prevent a later pattern of chronic dislocation.
There is a compression deformity lesion of posterolateral aspect of the humeral head.  There is a small fracture of the anterior aspect of the inferior rim of the glenoid fossa.  There is minimal inferior displacement of the small triangular fracture fragment. Both Hill-Sachs and osseous Bankart lesions are noted.
Hill-Sachs lesion, osseous Bankart lesion.  Evidence of prior anterior glenohumeral dislocation.
This classic constellation of findings stated above have only one possible diagnosis (it’s an Aunt Minnie).

The diagnosis is prior anterior dislocation of the humerus leading to a "Hill-Sachs" fracture/deformity of the posterolateral head of the humerus and an osseous "Bankart" lesion of the inferior glenoid labrum.
18 year old male has right shoulder pain.
Early surgical intervention may be a consideration, especially in younger patients. Recent studies suggest that surgical intervention after the first dislocation may reduce the rate of recurrence.
