EKG results:
Inferior lead ST elevation
T inversion from anterior leads
Lab results:
CRP 2.6
CK 495
Troponin 12.27
CK-MB 63
Follow up with primary care physician in 2 to 3 days.  Follow up with pediatric cardiology in 2 weeks. No strenuous activity until cleared by cardiology.
• Patchy foci of delayed hyperenhancement in the inferior wall,
inferior lateral wall, and the anterior wall of the left ventricle in a subepicardial location
• Preserved left ventricular systolic function without segmental wall motion abnormalities in a nondilated left 
ventricle
Acute Myocarditis
• Pericarditis
• Myocarditis
• Myocardial infarction
This 16 year old boy complained of chest pain radiating from his jaw to the left arm. He also complained of nausea and vomiting. The pain began about two days prior to hospital visit and about a week prior he had a viral illness. Patient has no remarkable past medical history.
Two videos are included with this case:

Both videos show that there is no wall motion abnormality supporting the diagnosis of myocarditis rather than infarction.
