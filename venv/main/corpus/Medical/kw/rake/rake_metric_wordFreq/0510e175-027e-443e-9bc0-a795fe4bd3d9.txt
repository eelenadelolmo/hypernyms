27 year old female referred to Neurosurgery with Third Ventricular Tumor
The "tanycytic ependymoma" is an uncommon subtype of ependymoma with a fibrillary appearance and piloid or "hair-like" cells.  Rosette formation is rare compared to other types of ependymoma.  The prognosis is probably similar to other ependymomas.  PMID: 15690137
