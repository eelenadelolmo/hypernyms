Unremarkable physical exam - No abnormal labs
As the patient has ongoing claims pending with the VA for chronic LBP, he was referred to Neurosurgery for further evaluation.
The conus medullaris terminates somewhat inferiorly to the normal position at the L2 level.  A 3.4 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm T1 hyperintense, T2 hyperintense, fat-saturated and non-enhancing lesion is present at the termination of the conus medullaris, which is consistent with an intrathecal lipoma.  While the cauda equina is tightly packed at the level of the lipoma, there is good dispersion inferiorly, without evident tethering and no significant nerve root stretching.  The bone marrow is not pathologically infiltrated.  There is no significant spondyloarthropathy of the lumbosacral spine.
