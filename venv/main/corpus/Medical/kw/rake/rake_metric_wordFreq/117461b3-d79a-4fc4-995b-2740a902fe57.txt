Patient was treated endovascularly.  ICA aneurysm was coiled.
CT with contrast shows an enlarged R parasellar region consistent with an ICA aneurysm, and abnormal vasculature filling with contrast in the R posterior fossa.  The R Carotid angiogram shows a large, cavernous ICA aneurysm.  The angiogram also shows that this aneurysm is draining into the cavernous sinus.  The R superior opthalmic vein is engorged, and visible in the arterial phase.  The carotid cavernous fistula is also draining posteriorly into the transverse and sigmoid sinuses (likely through the superior petrosal and inferior petrosal sinuses)which are also visible in the arterial phase of the angiogram.
