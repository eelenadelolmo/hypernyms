The patient was placed on antibiotics and CT guidance was used to place a drain.
An air-fluid level is present within a well-circumscribed fluid collection that has an enhancing wall.  This collection is adjacent to and contiguous with a thickened descending colon, that also demonstrates a diverticulum.
Abdominal Abscess
Crohn’s fistula with abscess
Diverticulitis with abscess
Penetrating injury with abscess
57 yo man with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease) and diverticulosis. He presents now with left lower quadrant pain and fever.
This case presents a mild diagnostic dilemma when attempting to determine the etiology of the abscess.  The treatment is unchanged, however.
