No treatment may be necessary if there is no obstruction to CSF flow. It should be noted that colloid cysts of the Third ventricle have been associated with sudden death thought to be associated with acute hydrocephalus.
There is a hyperintense spherical lesion at the superior aspect of the third ventricle on the FLAIR and T1 sequences, measuring approximately 5 mm in diameter. There is no enlargement of the ventricular system, suggesting that this lesion does not obstruct CSF flow through the third ventricle.
Colloid Cyst
Differential diagnosis includes:

-Colloid cyst
-Meningioma
-Elongated Basilar Artery
38 year old man with incidental finding on previous head CT.
Although the MR appearance of colloid cysts can be variable, protein content typically results in hyperintensity on the T1 weighted images. The location of this lesion is typical of colloid cysts.
