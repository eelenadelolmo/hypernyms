Pt was drowsy, responding incoherently.  Mild neck stiffness was seen.  Plantar reflex up.
Vision normal, ocular movements were full.  
Blood sugar 350 mg%
Lumbar puncture was deferred.
CT scan was taken
MRI scan was taken
• Endoscopic sinus surgical clearance of the disease.
• Broad spectrum antibiotics
• Prophylactic anticonvulsants
• Insulin

Patient responded to conservative management within a couple of days. Patient was taken up for endoscopic sinus surgery on the 5th day of admission. When the sphenoid sinus was entered fungal balls could be seen filling the cavity. The same were removed and the patient showed dramatic improvement postoperatively.
• CT scan showed a mass showing varying signal intensities arising from the sphenoid sinus eroding the skull base and extending up to the middle cranial fossa.  On soft-tissue windows the material was hyperattenuating.  Since the mass was lying close to the cavernous sinus MRI scan was taken.
• MRI showed a mass lesion arising from the sphenoid sinus eroding the skull base at the level of middle cranial fossa.  Cavernous sinus was found free of disease.  T1 and T2 weighted images showed a decrease in the signal intensity.
Sphenoid Mucocele with fungal sinusitis (aspergillus niger)and secondary intra-cranial extension
• Malignancy of sphenoid sinus
• Mucocele involving the sphenoid sinus
• Fungal sinusitis involving the sphenoid sinus
Admitted with altered sensorium, and fever with rigors of 4 days duration.
Known diabetic on irregular treatment.  H/O recurrent episodes of head ache ++
This case is presented for its rarity.  Fungal sinusitis is common in immunocompromised individuals.  In India we commonly come across patients with normal immunity being affected by fungal sinusitis.  Diagnosis can only be clinched during surgery and confirmed histopathologically by demonstration of allergic fungal mucin.
Imaging plays a vital role in the diagnosis.  Characteristically CT scan showed a mass lesion with varying signal intensities (a characteristic feature of fungal sinusitis).  Since the patient had intracranial extension MRI scan was done to rule out involvement of cavernous sinus.
