Procedure:  Immediately following ingestion of 1 mCi of 99mTc- sulfur colloid mixed in scrambled eggs, serial dynamic anterior and posterior images of the abdomen were acquired for 90 minutes with the patient on supine position.   Anterior and posterior gastric regions-of-interest yielded a computer-derived, geometric mean calculated time-activity curve from which the one-half gastric emptying time (T-1/2) of the stomach was calculated.  Images were dynamically displayed and visually interpreted from a computer monitor. 

Following the completion of the initial phase, 10 mg of metoclopramide (Reglan) was injected intravenously, and dynamic images of the anterior and posterior abdomen were obtained for 15 minutes.  The acquisition of the images, processing of the one-half gastric emptying time, and the visual interpretation of the images were performed as in the initial phase of this examination.
The patient was sent back to the referring provider who will correlate with clinical information and will make a final decision regarding a treatment for the patient.
The stomach appears usual in shape and orientation (anterior images are displayed only).  Following a lag phase of 10 minutes, the stomach empties progressively at a constant rate with a calculated one-half gastric emptying time of 89 minutes (normal is 45 to 90 minutes), which corresponds with the visual estimate.  No gastroesophageal reflux is observed throughout the study, and anterograde movement of radiolabelled meal throughout the intestine appears normal.  
 
Following intravenous injection of metoclopramide (Reglan), gastric emptying accelerates with a calculated one-half gastric emptying time of 7 minutes.
BORDERLINE NORMAL GASTRIC EMPTYING
N/A
43 year-old male status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy with a bloated feeling.  Please perform gastric emptying study to evaluate gastric transit.  UGI series performed 2 years prior notable only for a small hiatal hernia with a moderate gastroesophageal reflux.
By strict definition, this patient has a normal one-half gastric emptying time of 89 minutes.  However, the clinical situation suggests that the patient is symptomatic and may require a treatment.  The second portion of the study demonstrates that metoclopramide (Reglan) is effective in increasing the gastric motility and is a reasonable choice for a medical therapy.
