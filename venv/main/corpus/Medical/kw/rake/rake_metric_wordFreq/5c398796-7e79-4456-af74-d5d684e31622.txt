Large knee effusion visible on frontal and lateral radiographs.
Knee effusion
hemarthrosis
synovial effusion
Pain after fall
Evaluation of the lateral, partially flexed knee radiograph for effusion as a junior radiology resident often seems nebulus.  A useful starting point while developing our internal catelog of "normal" is what is described by Resnick and Kransdorf in Chpt 3 of Bone and Joint Imaging.  The soft tissue density created by the collapsed suprapetellar pouch between the anterior suprapatellar fat pad and the prefemoral fat pad in from of the distal femoral supracondylar region is usually less than 5 mm but may range up to 10mm.  Over 10mm in thickness, there is likely fluid in the joint.  This doesn't help to narrow the broad differential of traumatic, infectious, inflammatory/synovitis... causes but atleast allows you to start working on it.
