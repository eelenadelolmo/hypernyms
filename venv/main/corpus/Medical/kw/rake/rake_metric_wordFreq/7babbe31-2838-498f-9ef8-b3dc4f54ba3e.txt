Normal.
No malignancy potential.  Patients shoud be warned of synergistic effects of smoking related diseases such as fibrosis and lung cancer.
Plain film and axial CT images of the chest demonstrate a large left sided calcified pleural plaque with a leaflike appearance and thick rolled edges.
Asbestos Pleural Plaques
Virtually pathognomomic of asbestosis exposure
differential considerations include:
talc exposure
prior hemothorax, empyema
therapeutic pneumothorax for TB
77 yo male for follow up.  Retired factory worker.
This is an advaced calcification with leaflike and thick rolled edges.  Calcification of pleural plaques starts in the parietal pleura and involves mainly the posterior and anterolateral aspects of the pleura.  Typically, plaques spare the lung apices and costophrenic angles.  Pleural plaques are unilateral in 25% of cases.
