Axial FLAIR images demonstrate multiple punctate foci of signal abnormality in the deep white matter.  Axial and coronal diffusion images demonstrate a single focus of high signal within the left medulla consistent with recent infarct.
Left PICA Infarct confirmed with MRI.  MR angiogram images and CT angiogram images demonstrated a patent vertebral system and patent left PICA.  A focal stenosis was detected at the origin of the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery.
