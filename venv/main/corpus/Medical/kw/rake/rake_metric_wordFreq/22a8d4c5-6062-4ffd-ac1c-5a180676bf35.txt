Unknown.
CT without----There is a 12 x 9 x 10cm mass in the base of the right lung. There is some mass effect on the mediastinal structures, shifting them to the left.  The mediastinal structures are poorly visualized, however, on this non-contrast study. The cardiac fat plane appears to be intact.  There is no significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy demonstrated.  There is a moderate-sized right pleural effusion. 
CT with----Axial images were obtained through the thorax demonstrating a large highly vascular right lower thoracic mass.  The mass causes mild left shift with mediastinal structures and has enlarged slightly compared to the prior CT. It is unclear whether the mass originates from the parenchyma or from the chest wall.  There is complete collapse of the right lower lobe and right middle lobe, with a right pleural effusion.  There is no mediastinal adenopathy or additional pulmonary lesions.)
Malignant Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma
Primary Lung CA, Infection, Lymphoma, Pleuropulmonary Blastoma, Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma, Neuroblastoma, Synovial Sarcoma, Extraskeletal Myxoid Chondrosarcoma , Pseudomesotheliomatous Angiosarcoma
26-year old shortness-of-breath walking one flight of stairs for roughly twenty yards. 5 years ago she was diagnosed with a bulky embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of her right hand. She received 5400 cGy to the area and hoping to gain local control.  She did have local recurrence and required amputation in 2001 when the locally recurrent tumor became bulking and had uncontrolled bleeding.
No spicific discussion for this case.
