Physical exam was normal.  Semen analysis revealed azoospermia.
The patient was referred to an infertility clinic for surgical sperm retrieval [microepididymal sperm aspiration (MESA) or testicular sperm extraction (TESE)] and IVF.
US findings: multiple anechoic, serpiginous, tubular structures of varying sizes within the testicle.
Intratesticular varicoceles
The profound dilatation and augmentation of flow with valsalva is diagnostic for intratesticular varicoceles. 

Benign intratesticular cystic lesions: 
intratesticular simple cysts
tubular ectasia
epidermoid cyst
tunica albuginea cyst
intratesticular varicocele
abscess
hemorrhage
26 year old man undergoing an infertility evaluation.
In patients with extratesticular varicoceles and infertility, internal spermatic vein ligation or percutaneous venographic occlusion is usually performed.  At this point there are no generally accepted analogous alternatives for patients with intratesticular varicocels.
