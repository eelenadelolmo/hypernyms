Unknown thus far.  A referral to gastroenterology was recommended.
On fluoroscopy there are typically multiple small, less that 1cm, sharply defined masses or filling defects throughout the stomach of similar sizes.
Multiple gastric polyps
Hyperplastic polyps secondary to inflammation (majority)
Adenomatous polyps secondary to chronic atrophic gastritis or polyposis syndrome
Hamartomas secondary to polyposis syndrome
Metastatic disease, often melanoma, breast, or lung
55 year old female with history of stomach pains, mainly postprandial.
This case nicely demonstrates the fluoroscopic appearance of multiple gastric polyps.  They are likely sequela of previous inflammation, but a referral to gastroenterology was recommended for further evaluation and likely endoscopy for a tissue biopsy.
