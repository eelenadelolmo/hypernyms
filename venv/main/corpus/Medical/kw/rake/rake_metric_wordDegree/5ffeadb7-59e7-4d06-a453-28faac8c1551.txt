Physical Exam was significant for a firm abdomen with mild diffuse tenderness slightly worse over the right lower quadrant, which differed slightly from the chief complaint.  There were normoactive bowel sounds without palpable masses or CVA tenderness.  The lung and heart exams were within normal limits.  

Labs: A CBC was significant for a white blood cell count of 14,000.  A BMP showed; sodium 131, Cl 94, BUN 19, and was otherwise within normal limits.  A urinalysis was normal.

The patient was given fluids and antibiotics and observed overnight in the hospital for suspected gastroenteritis.  Following failure to improve overnight, the patient was sent for an abdominal x-ray and a contrasted abdominal CT scan to assess for possible appendicitis.
The patient was sent to the OR for emergent surgical splenectomy.  The postoperative period was complicated by a retroperitoneal hematoma and post operative illeus.  The patient recovered and was subsequently discharged five days after splenectomy.  The patient was readmitted 2 weeks later for post splenectomy fever and treated with antibiotics.
Image 1 of an upright abdominal x-ray shows non-specific stool in the right colon and a paucity of bowel gas in the lateral left abdomen.

2 Images:  A CT slice through the upper abdomen shows stomach, liver and dilated bowel loops without visualization of the spleen.  A lower slice shows an enlarged spleen with nearby bowel loops and kidneys.  This lower slice is below the distal border of the liver.   

3D reconstructions show an enlarged spleen separated from the margin of the diaphragm by both the stomach and loops of bowel.

This is an 8 year old female seen in the emergency room with a 2 day history of left sided abdominal pain and vomiting.  The mother reports a fever at home of 102 prior to coming to the ED.  The mother noted a decrease in the child’s activity over the past few days.  She also states her daughter has not had a bowel movement over the past few days and admitted that this was a chronic recurring problem.  There were no known sick contacts.  The mother denies any trauma.
The patient in this case experienced a slight delay in diagnosis secondary to the overall rarity in which wandering spleen presents in the general population.  On presentation to the emergency department, this diagnosis would have, at best, been at the bottom of a long, extensive differential list.  But more commonly, the diagnosis of wandering spleen would have been left off the differential in favor of a shorter, more manageable differential diagnosis list for acute abdominal pain used to direct diagnostic testing.  This patient was ultimately found to have an infracted wandering spleen secondary to imaging done to rule out appendicitis.  The patient’s outcome was likely unaffected by the delay.  The patient had already been complaining of abdominal pain for two days prior to admission reducing the likelihood of reversible ischemia and possible splenic salvage.  The delay in diagnosis overnight also allowed time for the patient to be rehydrated preoperatively.
