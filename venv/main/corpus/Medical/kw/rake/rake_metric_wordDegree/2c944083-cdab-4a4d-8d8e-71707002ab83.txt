Texto: 
Enlarged right distal femur, tender to palpation, without erythema, ecchymosis, or effusion.
Patient underwent chemotherapy and limb-salvage therapy and is doing well.
KNEE, RT (AP,LAT,SUNRISE):
An area of destruction extends over approximately a 7cm segment of the medial aspect of the distal shaft of the right femur.  Approximately 1/4 of the width of the shaft has been destroyed with an irregular overlying cortex and a mottled area throughout the adjacent medullary cavity which shows both areas of bone destruction and bone production.  Some elevation of the periosteum has a tendency towards layering as well as some dense spicules of bone arranged at right angles to the underlying bone.  There appears to be an associated soft tissue mass associated with this lesion and the growth plate at the distal end of the femur is not involved. 

CT SCAN OF THE RIGHT DISTAL FEMUR:
Right distal femur destructive lytic lesion with significant cortical breakthrough and periosteal/soft tissue component extending from the distal diaphysis into the metaphysis with probable involvement of the more medial physeal plate.  The subarticular epiphyses do not appear involved.  

THREE PHASE, MULTIPLE AREA AND TOTAL BODY BONE SCAN:
The immediate flow portion of the study shows a moderately intense hyperemic response to the distal one-third of the right femur.  The left femur and knee shows normal perfusion.  The immediate blood pool images show a mild to moderate, basically symmetrical, hyperemic response of the distal
one-half of the right femur to the physes.  There are moderately intense irregular hyperemic areas, particularly involving the right lateral growth plate area, and on the medial aspect, an area smaller in size but equal in intensity.  This area extends proximally along the medial aspect of the distal femoral shaft.  The overall pattern is suggestive of cortical expansion.  The left femur and knee shows normal blood pool activity.  The total body bone images acquired approximately 2.5 to 3.0 hours post-injection show moderately intense uptake of the radiopharmaceutical bilaterally within the proximal humerus involving the physes.  The intensity of uptake decreases going from anterior to posterior.  The pattern is symmetrical comparing the left humerus with the right humerus.  Intense uptake is noted in the right distal femoral physes extending proximally in an irregular pattern to approximatly midshaft.  There appears
to be cortical expansion throughout this area with a heterogeneous uptake and pattern in the distal one-third of the femoral shaft.  The pattern of uptake is irregular with intense localization involving the lateral aspect of the physes extending proximately along the femoral shaft.  The medial aspect also shows intense uptake that extends proximally for only a short distance.  There is a central area of decreased activity between the medial and lateral areas just proximal to the midportion of the physes.  There is a
frank lytic area involving the proximal medial portion of the femoral shaft. The pattern of uptake from the midright shaft to the distal one-third is irregular with heterogeneous uptake. 
 
MRI OF THE RIGHT FEMUR:
There is a soft tissue mass involving the medial aspect of the
right distal femur, which wraps around the distal femur.  Medially, there is destruction of the cortex.  The medullary cavity is filled with tumor from the distal diaphysis to the epiphyseal plate.  Scattered regions of abnormal signal and enhancement involve the epiphysis, suspicious for involvement
across the epiphyseal plate.  Entire dimensions of the tumor are 14.9 x 5.8 x 5.9 cm.  The adjacent soft tissues and muscles demonstrate edema.  The mass appears to be fairly well encapsulated, however, where it closely abuts the muscles of
the lower thigh, local invasion cannot be excluded.  The lesion demonstrates uniform low signal on T1 and heterogeneous high signal on T2.
