No follow-up apparent. Hematuria symptoms resolved.
Abnormal Study With Development Of Thin Cortical Calcifications, Which Extend Into The Medullary Spaces Along The Columns Of Bertin, As Well As Heterogeneous Enhancement Of The Kidneys And Minimal Delayed Excretion.

The Overall Pattern Is Compatible With Acute Cortical Necrosis.
Cortical nephrocalcinosis due to acute renal cortical necrosis
Acute renal cortical necrosis
Primary/secondary oxalosis
Chronic glomerulonephritis
Alports syndrome (glomerulonephritis, endstage kidney disease, and hearing loss) 
Intrarenal infection in HIV+
Amphotericin B
Acute/chronic renal allograft rejection
Autosomal recessive polycystic disease
50 yo woman with history of retroperitoneal paraganglioma, s/p resection. Patient developed gross hematuria one week post-op. CT for hematuria revealed an incidental finding.
Patient had episode of hypotension during paraganglioma resection. Hypotension hypothesized to have induced acute renal cortical necrosis.
