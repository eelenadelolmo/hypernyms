VS: BP 126/83, HR 86, afebrile. 
Gen: Awake, alert, oriented to person, place, time. No apparent distress. 
Abdomen: Mildly protuberant abdomen. Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly.
The patient was offered and scheduled for prophylactic Ladd procedure. He later withdrew consent for the procedure and has been lost to follow-up.
All of the small bowel loops are confined to right hemi-abdomen. 
The Cecum is in a normal RLQ anatomical position. 
The Colon is mostly in left hemi-abdomen, and the ascending colon deviates to the left.
Intestinal Malrotation
• Intestinal malrotation
• Intestinal non-rotation
This 44 yo man was referred to Radiology for virtual colonoscopy. He has a remote family history of colon cancer. He denies melena, hematochezia, constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.

Medical Hx: asthma, hypertension, chronic lower back pain.
Surgical Hx: none
Family Hx: Colon cancer - remote.
Social Hx: (-)tobacco, (-)alcohol
The management of asymptomatic adults with intestinal malrotation should involve a discussion of the benefits and risks of surgical intervention versus the risk of developing instestinal volvulus or obstruction. As virtual colonoscopy becomes more available, the discovery of intestinal malrotation as an incidental finding is likely to become more frequent using this imaging modality.
