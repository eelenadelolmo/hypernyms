There is mild tenderness to palpation in the dorsum of the left foot over the tarsal navicular bone.
The patient was being followed with conservative management.
Three views of the left foot show that the navicular bone is flattened (wafer-like) and has a heterogeneous radiodense/sclerotic appearance.  The adjacent joint spaces are preserved.  Incidental note is made of mild pes planus.  No other abnormalities are noted.
