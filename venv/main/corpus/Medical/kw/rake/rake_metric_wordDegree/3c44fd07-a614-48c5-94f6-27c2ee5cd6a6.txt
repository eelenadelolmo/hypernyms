Pt. with  tachypnea and increased respirations.
There is a large loculated mucous plug within the right main stem bronchus, from the level of the carinaand extending into the bronchus intermedius and its branching airways within the right lower lobe to affect mostly the basal segment of the right lower lobe.  There is consolidation in the medial basal and posterior basal segments of the right lower lobe with associated pleural fluid collection.
Mucus Plug
foreign body, mucus plug, infection [fungus, TB, pneumonia], bronchogenic carcinoma, carcinoid tumor, adenocystic carcinoma, endobronchial metastases, lymphoma.
26 y/o man with traumatic brain injury had oxygen saturation decrease to mid 80’s which would not correct with O2 by face mask.
