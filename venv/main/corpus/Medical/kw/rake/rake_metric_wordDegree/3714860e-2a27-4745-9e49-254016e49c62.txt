Reports pain with movement of right wrist, but no significant limitations of range of motion or weakness.

Mild swelling and tenderness to palpation over the right wrist.
Physical therapy with periodic radiographic follow-up exams to asses progression of disease.
Routine radiographs of the right wrist demonstrate widening of the scapholunate joint, which is slightly increased relative November, 2002 exam.  The lunate has decreased in size with increased sclerosis and now evident transverse lucency proximally.  Irregular contour of the proximal lunate noted on lateral view. Chondrocalcinosis is noted in the lunatotriquetral ligament. The bones demonstrate diffuse osteopenia.
No ulna minus variance is present.

Decreased signal within the lunate on both T1 and T2 weighted sequences with a small focus of subtly increased T2 signal along its dorsal aspect.  The lunate appears fragmented on the dorsal component. There are cysts within the capitate and the hamate. Soft tissue edema noted about the wrist. The scaphoid is tilted in a volar projection.
Kienbock’s Lunatomalacia
Avascular necrosis of the lunate with developing scapho-lunate advanced collapse (SLAC).
65 y/o WF with PMH of HTN, A-fib and osteoporosis, presents with 2 week history of right wrist pain without specific injury in November, 2002.  Returns for follow-up examination June, 2003.
No specific trauma led to disease development.  No evidence ulna minus variance.  History of repetitive work related activity not elicited.
