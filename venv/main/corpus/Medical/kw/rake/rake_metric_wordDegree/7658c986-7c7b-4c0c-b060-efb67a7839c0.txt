Pain with palpation at the AC joint.  Positive Neer sign to suggest impingement syndrome.
Treatment options for impingement syndrome include arthroscopy and open acromioplasty.  Intersesting, though, is that the presence of os acromiale and concurrent instability at the acromion in a patient with impingement may result in a surgeon choosing to avoid anterior acromioplasty or arthroscopic acromial decompression, opting instead for an alternative open approach.  Hence, making the finding of os acromiale in the surgical candidate with rotator cuff disease is essential and not simply an exercise in recognizing a normal anatomic variant.
Figure 1 demonstrates a normal axial MR image of the acromioclavicular interface.  Figure 2 represents the AC interface of the patient specific to this case, which demonstrates an os acromiale, type A (failure of fusion of the mesacromial ossification center and the metaacromial ossification center).  Figure 3 shows the patient's AC joint utilizing a coronal T2 fat sat image.  This view demonstrates degenerative hypertrophic changes at the AC joint with surrounding edema.  Unfortunately, no plain radiographs of this patient are available.
Os acromiale
None; although it should be noted that, on plain radiographs, the typical os acromiale finding (specifically, a radiolucency horizontal to the axis of the distal acromion on axillay projection) may represent a normal, solidly ossified acromion vs. os acromiale.
Left shoulder pain and left upper extremity weakness for > 1 year.
On plain radiographs, os acromiale is best appreciated with the axial radiograph of the shoulder as a radiolucent line horizontal to the axis of the acromion (although one author specifically states that he found a solid osseous fusion to be present in several patients with this plain radiographic finding).  Detecting os acromiale on the standard frontal view of the shoulder is quite difficult.  Unfortunately, with respect to the specific patient whose images appear attached to this teaching file, no plain radiographs were available.  Axial CT images will also demonstrate the anomaly, but MR is felt to be the study of choice as the finding will usually be made in all planes and associated shoulder joint pathology can be demonstrated as well. 
     Sammarco reports the overall frequency of os acromiale to be 8%.  The finding was bilateral in 33% of the 1198 skeletons examined by Sammarco.  Of note, os acromiale was present in 8.5% of men and 4.9% of women, and was bilateral more often in men (35%) than in women (12.5%).  Further, African Americans had an increased incidence of the finding (13%) as compared to whites (5.8%), and the variant was bilateral more often in African Americans (44.7%) than in whites (22.4%).  The mean length of the acromial fragment was 21.9mm.  
     The significance of this anatomic finding in asymptomatic patients is of undetermined clinical significance.  However, os acromiale, when present in the setting of impingement syndrome or rotator cuff pathology, has been implicated as a predisposing factor to these conditions.  Specifically, os acromiale has been associated with acromioclavicular joint degenerative disease and contraction of the deltoid is felt to pull the os acromiale in a downward direction such that it impinges on the rotator cuff.  Also, osteophytes at the acromial gap are thought to perhaps impinge directly on the cuff.
