Syndesmophytes of the entire visualized spine, ligamentous ossification (especially supraspinous and interspinous ligaments), and sacroiliac joint ankylosis.
Ankylosing Spondylitis
Chronic back pain
Diagnosis is made with a combination of radiologic, laboratory and clinical features.  Radiologic features have been discussed above.  Laboratory studies show high association with the HLA-B27 histocompatibility antigen, and rheumatoid and LE factors are usually negative.  Clinical diagnosis may be made using the Modified New York Criteria (1984) including 1. Low back pain of at least 3 month&#8217;s duration improved by exercise and not relieved by rest, 2. Limitation of lumbar spinal motion in the sagittal and frontal planes, 3. Chest expansion decreased relative to normal values for age and sex, 4. Bilateral sacroiliitis grade 2-4, and 5. Unilateral sacroiliitis grade 3-4.
