Abdominal exam revealed dullness to percussion over LUQ and LLQ as well as periumbilical area. Large pass palpated just above the umbilicus. Labs revealed pancytopenia, elevated LAEs and an INR above normal range.
Splenectomy with splenic artery embolization.
Massive splenomegaly, increase in diameter of portal vein, stent present in common bile duct
Schistosomiasis
Malaria, Schistosomiasis, lymphoma, leukemia, EBV, sarcoidosis, TB
29 year old male from Ghana with 2 month history of abdominal pain, not well localized.
This is a case of chronic infection with schisotosomiasis. Eggs released by the adult collect in the epithelial tissues of the portal vein and pre-sinusoidal capillaries. The eggs illicit a profound immunologic response that eventually leads to fibrosis. Over an extended period of time this fibrosis leads to portal hypertension and can involve the spleen and lungs. The parenchyma of the liver remains essentially untouched. 

In this patient the non-cirrhotic portal hypertension also lead to esophageal and rectal varices.
