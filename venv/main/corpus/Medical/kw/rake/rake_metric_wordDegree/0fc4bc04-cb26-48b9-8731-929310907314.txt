Port wine stain over right face
CT image demonstrates right sided cerebral cortical atrophy with tram-track gyriform calcifications.

There is also enlargement of the right eye as compared with the left.
Sturge-Weber syndrome (encephalo-trigeminal angiomatosis)
<li>Buphthalmos
<li>Glaucoma
<li>Herpes Encephalitis (old)
12 year old boy with history of seizures.
Sturge Weber is a phakomatoses characterized by angiomas involving the leptomeninges and face. Classically the skin involvement involves a port wine stain in the V1/V2 distribution of the trigeminal nerve. The condition is caused by residual embryonic blood vessels that fail to resorb during development. The incidence is 1 in 50,000 with sporadic inheritance. Primary clinical findings may include seizures, developmental delay, and variable intellectual impairment.

Imaging findings include cortical calcifications and atrophy, abnormal draining veins, and enlarged choroid plexus. This patient also demonstrates buphthalmos with enlargement of the eye due to increased intraocular pressure from choroidal hemangiomas.
