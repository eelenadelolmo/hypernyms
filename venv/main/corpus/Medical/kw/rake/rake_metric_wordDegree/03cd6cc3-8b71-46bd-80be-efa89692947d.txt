SYNOVIAL FLUID - Birefringent crystals . . . . . . .  URATES

SYNOVIAL FLUID - Bacteriology Result:
  NO GROWTH AFTER 5 DAYS
Patient is currently undergoing workup from orthopedics.
AP, lateral and oblique views of the left third digit demonstrate a soft tissue mass on the extensor surface of the PIP joint.  There is mild erosive change of the radial aspect of the proximal phalangeal head with preservation of joint space and normal mineralization.
Tophaceous Gout
Soft tissue mass without calcification (DDX):
Amyloidosis
Xanthomatosis
Psoriasis
Tophaceous Gout
77 year old with "cyst on finger".
This patient with no known history of gout presented with a cystic lesion by physical exam.  The nonspecific soft tissue swelling with erosion in the head of the proximal phalanx still included a broad differential.  Tissue diagnosis confirmed the etiology.

Xanthomatosis occurs on the extensor surfaces of limbs with associated erosions.  History of hypercholesterolemia and tissue aspirate differentiates this disease.

Psoriasis presents with soft tissue swelling with normal bone density and articular erosion.  Hyperuricemia can occur in psoriasis secondary to rapid cell turnover.

Amyloidosis presents with soft tissue swelling and erosions.  This is typically symmetric and is associated with juxtaarticular osteopenia.
