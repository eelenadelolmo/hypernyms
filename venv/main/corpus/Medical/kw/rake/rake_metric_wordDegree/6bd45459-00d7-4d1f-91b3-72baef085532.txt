BHCG 17,000 (obtained after the ultrasound)
Sagittal ultrasound through the uterus demonstrates a mass either on the wall or in the wall of the uterus and vascular flow within it.

Images through the right adenexae demonstrate a cystic mass with a thick cortex adjacent to the right ovary.  There is increased flow in the periphery of this lesion.  No yolk sac or embryo was found.  Although not shown, the left ovary was normal in appearance.
Ectopic (Tubal)Pregnancy
Heterotopic Pregnancy â€“ simultaneous right ovarian and intrauterine pregnancies

Right adenexal ectopic pregnancy and molar / partial molar intrauterine pregnancy

Right adenexal ectopic pregnancy with an unrelated uterine mass such as a leiomyoma.
32 year old female presents for ultrasound follow-up of a large cyst on her left ovary seen 3 months ago on CT.  She recently found out she is 7 weeks pregnant based on date of last menstrual period. The patient is asymptomatic and has not been taking any medications.  No significant past medical history.
Most patients are symptomatic with a 7-week old ectopic pregnancy (e.g. pain), but this patient had no symptoms.
