A-P and lateral radiographs of bilateral elbows demonstrate bilateral swelling in the region of the olecranon bursae, which is more nodular on the left. The lateral radiographs of both elbows also show increased radiodensities in the bursae. These findings are consistent with tophi with calcifications in a patient with a known history of gout.
