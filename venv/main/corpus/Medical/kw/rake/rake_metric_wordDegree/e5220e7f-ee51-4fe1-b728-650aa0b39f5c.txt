Currently undergoing Orthopedic evaluation
Frontal and lateral radiographs of the left knee demonstrate a pedunculated, bony projection off the medial distal femur.  Orientation is away from the joint, and medullary continuity is clear.

Discussion (include references): 
An osteochondroma is a benign, cartilage-capped bony projection (exostosis) on the external surface of bone.  The structure of the tumor consists of a central core of bone marrow, which is by definition contiguous with the marrow of the underlying bone. The tumor is capped by a layer of hyaline cartilage, which frequently extends well over the pedicle and sometimes approaches the normal cortex. The tumor increases in size as the cartilaginous cap undergoes progressive enchondral ossification. The growth usually stops when the nearest epiphysis has closed. 
Osteochondromas are by far the most common of benign bone tumors. More than 50% occur in the proximal tibia or distal femur, as in this case. They may be pedunculated or sessile in shape. The pedunculated type are usually directed away from the joint, and may be easily diagnosed by plain film radiography if continuity with the bone is identified.
Fewer than 1% of osteochondromas may undergo malignant degeneration of the cartilage cap, resulting into secondary chondrosarcoma.  MRI and CT are the modalities of choice to accurately characterize cartilaginous cap thickness.  A cap thickness >1cm on CT or >2cm on MRI, with new onset pain and rapid growth suggests malignant degeneration. 
The tumor is often diagnosed as an incidental finding.  Most are asymptomatic, but they can cause symptoms depending on their location and size. Pain is usually caused by mass effect of the osteochondroma on surrounding tendons, muscles, or nerves. Pain can also result from fracture of the stalk of the osteochondroma from direct trauma. The bony cap of the stalk may infarct or undergo ischemic necrosis.
Routine prophylactic surgical removal of asymptomatic osteochondromas is not advocated.  If symptomatic, surgical resection is recommended.  The local recurrence rate after resection is about 2%.
