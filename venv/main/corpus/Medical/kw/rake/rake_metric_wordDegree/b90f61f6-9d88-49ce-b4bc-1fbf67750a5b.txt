Elevated creatinine
A biopsy is being planned and the patient will then likely be further evaluated by surgery.
Large retroperitoneal mass which predominately involves the inferior vena cava at the level of the renal vein drainage.  There are multiple punctate calcifications centrally.  It appears to be extending into the right psoas muscle and demonstrates mass effect on the right kidney and proximal ureter.

66 yo female status post placement of a right ureteral stent to treat right hydronephrosis and hydroureter secondary to extrinsic compression by a retroperitoneal mass
This is an interesting case of a large mass predominately involving the IVC.  Statistically this is likely an MFH, with a liposarcoma an leiomyosarcoma less likely, given the absence of fat.  Angiosarcoma, while extremely rare, is an interesting possibility.  The patient was just diagnosed with the mass and is awaiting biopsy.
