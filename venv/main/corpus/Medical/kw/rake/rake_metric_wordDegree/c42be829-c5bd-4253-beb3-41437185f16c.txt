Patient presents utilizing a cane but states that she did so before the MVA as well.   

Active range of motion of the cervical spine revealed flexion to 60o/50o, right rotation to 50o/80o, left rotation to 55o/80o, left lateral bending to 25o/45o, right lateral bending to 25o/45o and extension to 40o/60o.  She reported cervicothoracic pain with all ranges of motion.  
On inspection there is a 11 cm scar over the anterior left shoulder from previous surgery.  She reports that prior to the MVA she had full elevation of the left shoulder.  Active range of motion of the shoulders revealed the left shoulder could be elevated to 110o with report of left shoulder pain.  

Neer’s testing was positive on the left at 110o with report of left shoulder pain.  The Hawkins-Kennedy procedure was negative bilaterally.  The supraspinatus test was positive on the left side.  

Postural evaluation revealed a low left shoulder and a low right hip.  
Active range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine revealed flexion to 60o/90o, left and right lateral bending to 10o/25o, and extension to 10o/25o.  Low back pain was reported with all ranges of motion. 
The subpatellar and Achilles reflex were graded 0/4 bilaterally.  She was unable to toe or heel walk due to pain in the left foot.  

The figure 4 procedure on the left produced report of left hip pain.  The straight leg raise on the left side could be performed to 30o with report of lower back and left lower extremity pain extending to the foot.  The right straight leg raise on the right side could be performed to 60o with report of lower back pain.  
Percussion and posterior to anterior compression of the spine produced report of pain over the cervicothoracic and lumbosacral regions.  Hypomobility was noted at the cervicothoracic and lumbosacral regions. Muscle spasm was noted over the cervicothoracic and lumbosacral regions paraspinally. Pain/tenderness, asymmetry/misalignment, abnormal range of motion, and tissue/tone changes were associated with the areas of hypomobility.
Patient is receiving chiropractic care for her back injuries involving Estim to the cervicothoracic and lumbosacral regions, flexion distraction therapy, chiropractic manipulation, and Quantum exercise to strengthen the lower back and core stabilizers.

Moderately large Schmorl’s node of the central aspect of the superior end plate of L1 is noted without loss of vertebral height.  Large Schmorl’s node of the central anterior aspect of the superior end plate of L2 is noted with mild compression deformity of L2 with approximately 10-15% loss of anterior vertebral height without evidence for acute changes or bony marrow edema.  Small Schmorl’s node of the central aspect of the superior end plate of L3 is noted without compression fracture or loss of vertebral height.

T12-L1:  Mild posterior bulge. 

L1-2:  Posterior ridging with diffuse subligamentous protrusion extending approximately 2 mm in to the spinal canal minimally indenting the ventral thecal sac. 

L2-3:  Diffuse bulge/subligamentous protrusion extending approximately 3 mm into the spinal canal mildly indenting the ventral thecal sac without central or foraminal stenosis.  

L3-4:  Diffuse posterior herniation of the protrusion type extending approximately 4 mm into the spinal canal mildly indenting the ventral thecal sac and mildly effacing the exiting L4 nerve roots.  

L4-5:  Mild broad-based diffuse subligamentous protrusion extending approximately 3 mm into the spinal canal mildly indenting the ventral thecal sac.  Left posterolateral annular tear and herniation encroaching on the left neural foramen and mildly effacing the exiting left L4 nerve root.  Right posterolateral ridging and bulge mildly effacing the undersurface of the exiting right L4 nerve root.  

L5-S1:  Right posterior annular tear and broad-based posterior herniation more prominent to the right extending approximately 5.5 mm into the spinal canal indenting the ventral thecal sac without associated central spinal stenosis.


» MRI Left Foot:
There are fractures of the distal shafts of the fourth and fifth metatarsals.  The fourth metatarsal fracture is an oblique fracture while the fifth metatarsal fracture is a transverse fracture close to the fifth metatarsal neck.  Whether or not there is callous formation cannot be determined.  There is associated osseous edema.

No adjacent muscle or tendon tear is detected.
Multi-level disc herniation with left lower extremity radiculopathy.
Disc herniation
Vertebral fracture with resulting nerve root compression
Lumbosacral muscle strain
Spondylosis
Spondylolisthesis

Patient is a 53 y.o. woman who was involved in a vehicular accident.  She reports that around the time period of the accident she was unemployed.  Due to hearing loss she has been on SSD for the last 1? years.  

She was a belted passenger in the back seat behind the driver.  When the impact occurred her head struck the side window.  She reports loss of consciousness, was dazed, had a headache, and had neck and lower back pain.  She also reports that her left foot was under the car seat and struck the jack with a resultant fractures.  

An ambulance was summoned and she went to the hospital.  She reports being examined, radiographs and an MRI performed and she was released.  She reports no medication was prescribed.  

She did consult an orthopedic surgeon who evaluated her toe fractures prescribed an MRI of the foot.   

Patient reports that prior to the accident she had no pain.  

Following the accident she felt pain in the left shoulder, neck, middle back and lower back.  She reports having left lower extremity pain extending from her back to the left foot.  She reports left knee pain from striking the seat.  She reports having loose bowels but no incontinence.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

Left shoulder replacement 2 years prior to accident following a fall which resulted in a fractured humerus.  Shoulder had been pain free for over a year prior to the accident.
She denies work episodes, other vehicular accidents or slips, falls or athletic episodes where an injury was sustained.  
She reports congenital deafness and has bilateral hearing aides.
She has a history of asthma.

She reports taking medications Lexapro, Ranitidine, Coumadin and vitamin D. 
She is allergic to coconuts

This is a patient who presents with low back pain extending to the foot following a motor vehicle accident.  She was pain free prior to the event.  
Due to her recent onset of symptoms an MRI was ordered and evaluated.  
The MRI revealed some pre-existing degenerative changes of the spine with Schmorl's nodes, (a protrusion of disc material into the vertebral endplates, present at multiple levels).  Additionally, there are broad-based, diffuse disc herniations at multiple disc levels.  The chronic degenerative changes suggest that these herniations could be chronic, however the patient was asymptomatic prior to her accident suggesting that the herniations are more acute.  In this case, making use of imaging findings to contribute to an understanding of the temporality of disc herniation.   
One means of doing so would be by use of the Coin criteria.  The Coin criteria is a means by which MRI findings can be used to asses the degree of degeneration of a disc and whether a disc injury may be secondary to this degeneration or to an acute traumatic event.  In the case of this patient, the disc herniations present would be classified as a Type 3 injury.  Type 3 injury involve the herniation of an already degenerated nucleus pulposus through a degenerate annulus fibrosis.  The disc is not calcified which would suggest a chronic herniation.  Because type 3 herniations occur in the presence of an already degenerated disc, it becomes important to attempt to determine whether the herniation resulted from the degeneration or from a traumatic event.  One aspect to consider is the anatomy of the herniation.  If the disc herniation is focal, lateral, or asymmetrical it is more likely to be associated with trauma while if the herniation is broad based it is more likely to be considered degenerative.  In the case of our patient the herniations are broad based.  Another aspect to consider is bone marrow edema; its presence suggests acute injury.  Our patient does not have bone marrow edema present.  Another proposed indication of acuity of the injury is the presence of the hyper-intense zone (HIZ).  It is possible that the presence of a HIZ, an area of increased signal on T2 weighted images that is distinct from the nucleus pulposus, is an indication of a more recent injury as it represents further internal disc protrusion as well as an inflammatory process around a tear in the annulus fibrosis.  At this point no studies have been done to confirm this hypothesis, but further studies are needed.  Our patient does have a HIZ.  The final, and most important, aspect to consider when determining whether the herniation is an acute injury or more chronic, is to consider the patient's description of symptoms and presence of clinical findings. In our patient, she had been without back or leg pain prior to the injury.  Following the injury, she developed a pattern of pain and neurological deficits that can be explained by disc herniations at L4-L5 and L5-S1 due to compressive or chemical means.  This suggests that the herniations were not present prior to the accident and were an acute result of the traumatic event.
