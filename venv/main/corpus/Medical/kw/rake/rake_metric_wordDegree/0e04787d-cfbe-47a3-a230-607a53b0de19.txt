Tenderness upon palpation of the "anatomic snuff box" at the base of the thumb.

Stable transverse waist fractures of the scaphoid are treated with casting, but take an unusually long time to heal (8 to 12 weeks). 

Unstable scaphoid fracture often require ORIF.  A special "Herbert" screw with a differential thread-pitch between its proximal & distal ends, is used to tightly oppose the fragments of the scaphoid in such cases.
Transverse fracture through the proximal waist of the scaphoid (navicular) bone.
Transverse fracture through the proximal waist of the scaphoid (navicular) bone.
Unstable scaphoid fracture associated with ligamentous injury
Fall onto an outstretched hand.
In this case, we are only provided one image for review.  

Multiple views or, even better, CT with multiplanar reformating should be performed to assess this fracture and its relationship to the entire wrist.  Scaphoid fractures are injuries with potential for debilitating sequelae. They should not be treated with casted before they are evaluated thoroughly radiographically and by physical examination.
