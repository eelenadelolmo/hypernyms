Initial physical exam revealed hypoxia and coarse breath sounds.
Care for these patients is supportive. They usually require ventilation and supplemental oxygen for extended periods in an intensive care unit.
1st Chest X-ray (Day 1) - global airspace opacity constistent with the presence of aspirated fluid in the airspaces after nearly drowning.

2nd Chest X-ray (Day 2) - interval clearing of the initial airspace opacity by redistribution and diffusion of fluid by the lungs.

3rd Chest X-ray (Day 3)- new patchy bilateral airspace opacities developing 48 hours after the initial insult.
ARDS from Near Drowning
The differential for patchy airspace opacities includes:

• Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
• Pneumonia
• Interstitial Edema/Pulmonary Edema
• Aspiration/Drowning
22 year old man status post drowning incident.
There are multiple causes for ARDS.  In addition to drowning, other causes include infection, septic shock, trauma, chemical inhalation, and many others.  The inciting event causes injury and inflammatory changes within the lungs which increases alveolar permeability, thus allowing the influx of fluid within. This usually occurs within 24 to 48 hours after the initial injury. This patient was hospitalized for 17 days following his near-drowning event.
