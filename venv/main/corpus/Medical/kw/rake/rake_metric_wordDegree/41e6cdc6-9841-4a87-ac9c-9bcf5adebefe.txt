Axial noncontrast CT of the head (in blood and brain windows) demonstrates a crescentic shaped hyperdense extra-axial collection along the left frontal convexity, which measures 1 cm in the greatest width. There is approximately 8 mm midline shift to the right with subfalcine herniation and mild to moderate effacement of the left lateral ventricle. No significant uncal herniation.
