Physical exam was nonspecific.
Emergent aortic valve replacement and thoracic aortic graft.  Abdominal aorta graft placement will be performed in the future.
An acute abdominal series/chest xray demonstrated widening of the mediastinum with a dilated aortic knob and apparent aneurysmal dilatation of the descending thoracic aorta.
Aortic dissection.
Traumatic aortic dissection
Aortic aneurysm
Non Traumatic aortic dissection
Mediastinal tumors
A previously healthy 22-year-old active duty male presented with intermittent left upper quadrant/epigastric abdominal pain for two and a half weeks.
Dissections involving the ascending aorta can induce one or more of the following: aortic insufficiency, heart failure, acute myocardial ischemia/MI, cardiac tamponade and sudden death (rupture of the aorta into the pericardial space), variation (>20 mmHg) in systolic blood pressure between the arms, neurologic deficits, Horner syndrome (compression of the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion), vocal cord paralysis and hoarseness (compression of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve). 

Dissection involving the descending aorta can lead to: splanchnic ischemia, renal insufficiency, lower extremity ischemia, or focal neurologic deficits due to spinal artery involvement and spinal cord ischemia.
