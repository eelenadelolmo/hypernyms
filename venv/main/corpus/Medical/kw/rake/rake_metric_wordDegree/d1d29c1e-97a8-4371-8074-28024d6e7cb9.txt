Patient’s scrotum was exquisitely tender on physical exam.
Orchiectomy of the left testicle was performed. The cancer was stage I testicular seminoma. Following orchiectomy, ultrasound showed no evidence of the seminoma. Ultrasound of the right testicle was normal. The recommended follow up for stage I seminoma is active surveillance which consists of a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis three times a year for the first 3 years and then twice a year for years 4 to 7 and then annually until 10 years. Adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation may help prevent relapse but active surveillance is usually sufficient.
Ultrasound shows a homogenous hypoechoic mass occupying the majority of the left testicle.
Seminoma
The most common testicular neoplasm is a seminoma, which is a type of germ cell tumors. The differential also includes other germ cell tumors such as embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, and epidermoid cyst.  Other types of testicular cancer include stromal tumors, mixed germ cell-stromal tumors, and metastatic disease.
38 year old male with a 2 week history of left testicular swelling and pain.
