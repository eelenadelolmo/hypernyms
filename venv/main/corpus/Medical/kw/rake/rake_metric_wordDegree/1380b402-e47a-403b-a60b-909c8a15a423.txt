Red mass behind right tympanic membrane
Surgery
1.5 cm mass in the right jugular foramen
Mass best seen on contrast scans with fat suppresion
Small flow voids within mass
Glomus tympanicum and glomus jugulare tumors (paraganglioma)
glomus tympanicum tumor
metastatic disease
cholesteatoma
62 year old female with  6 months of right ear pain
-Familial and non-familial patterns exist with synchronous lesions seen up to 25% of familial cases. The likelihood of synchronous lesions drops to 5-10% in sporadic cases.
-The lesions are highly vascular , and the “Salt and Pepper” appearance may be seen in larger lesions (>2 cm) on MR. This is suggestive of the diagnosis when in the correct location.
- Four common locations:
    Middle ear cavity-tympanicum paragangliomas
    Jugular foramen-jugular paragangliomas
    High carotid space-vagal paragangliomas
    Carotid bifurcation-carotid body paragangliomas
