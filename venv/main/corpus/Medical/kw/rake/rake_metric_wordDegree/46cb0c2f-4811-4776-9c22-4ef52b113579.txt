Chest Radiograph-PA image from a two view study (lateral not shown) shows an irregular apical pleural thickening and a heterogeneous and predominantly lucent process at the right apex with 2nd and 3rd rib posterior rib destruction.

Contrast-enhanced CT chest showed a lobular hypodense and minimally enhancing lesion arising from the region of the posterior right lung apex with extension into the adjacent posterior chest wall with extension to involve several levels of C-spine neuroforamina and likely involves the brachial plexus and intercostals nerves at that level.
