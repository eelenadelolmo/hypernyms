Detailed orthopedic physicial examination findings not available.  The MR examination requisition states "pain and decreased ROM" at the right knee.
This information was not available.  Please refer to the accompanying factoid for a discussion of typical treatment options for this type of injury.
An axial T2 fat saturated (TR/TE 3000/83.42) and three contiguous coronal (from anterior to posterior) T2 fast spin echo fat saturated (TR/TE 3000/85.5) MR images through the right knee show increased signal intensity within and surrounding the deep portions of the MCL, indicating a Grade II MCL injury/partial tear.  The superficial layers of the MCL remain intact.  Also note the focal area of abnormal increased bone marrow signal intensity surrounding an obliquely oriented, relatively hypointense fracture line in the medial femoral condyle, indicating a concomitant subchondral impaction injury in this location.  The aforementioned bone marrow injury may have occurred as a result of a direct impaction mechanism in this case, since the typical bone marrow injury pattern of a valgus stress is not present in this patient's knee.

A coronal T1 (TR/TE 700/15) weighed MR image through the right knee in the same patient shows the abnormal, intermediate intrasubstance signal intensity within the MCL (black arrowhead).
Medial Collateral Ligament Injury, Grade II/Partial Tear
Please see the accompanying factoid.
A 25 year old Caucasian male presents with acute right knee pain that occurred when his opponent impacted his knee during a wrestling match.
Please see the accompanying factoid.
