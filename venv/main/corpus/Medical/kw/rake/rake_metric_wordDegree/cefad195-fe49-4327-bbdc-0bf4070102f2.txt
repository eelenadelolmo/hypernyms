LE paresthesias and hyperreflexia.
Well defined ovoid hyperdensities on T2 and FLAIR are noted in the brainstem, as well as in the deep white matter.
Multiple Sclerosis
• Multiple Sclerosis (most likely, given that the patient also had T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the cervical spinal cord)
• Nerve impingment (less likely given the patient's age)
• Trauma (unlikely, given the lack of any significant trauma in the patient's hx)
24 year old male with lower extremity paresthesias and hyperreflexia.
The patient was young (in 20s) and had findings in the deep white matter of the brain, brain stem, and cervical spinal cord, making MS the most likely diagnosis.
