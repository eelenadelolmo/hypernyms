Anticoagulation
V/Q study with 44 mCi Tc99m DTPA, aerosolized to deliver 1 mCi, and 8.8 mCi Tc99m macroaggregated albumin (MAA), demonstrates decreased counts in the apical, posterior, and anterior segments of the right upper lobe on the posterior perfusion image.  Additionally, there are decreased counts in the lateral segment of the right middle lobe.  These findings are also demonstrated on the RPO and LPO perfusion images.  Additionally, best seen on the left lateral, anterior, and LAO perfusion images there are decreased counts in the apical posterior and anterior segments of the left upper lobe.  The ventilation scan is normal.  

As there are at least 2 large mismatched perfusion defects without any ventilation abnormalities, and using the PIOPED II V/Q scan interpretation categories and criteria, these findings are most consistent with a high-probability V/Q scan.

The corresponding chest radiograph does not show focal abnormalities.  No secondary signs of embolism, such as pleural effusion, oligemia, or apparent hilar enlargement, can be seen.
High-Probability V/Q study for Pulmonary Embolus
Differential Diagnosis of Conditions Associated with Ventilation-Perfusion Mismatch:

Acute pulmonary embolus
Chronic pulmonary embolus
Other causes of embolism (drug abuse, iatrogenic)
Bronchogenic carcinoma (other neoplasms)
Mediastinal or hilar adenopathy with obstruction of pulmonary artery or veins
Hypoplasia or aplasia of pulmonary artery
Swyer-James syndrome (some cases)
Post-radiation therapy
Vasculitis
62 yo male with PMHx significant for prostate cancer treated with XRT, chronic renal insufficiency, and prior left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis presents with acute shortness of breath after being diagnosed with a right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.

Other Information:  Using the Wells prediction rule for diagnosing pulmonary embolism, this patient had a score greater than 7, placing him at a high-pretest probability of having a pulmonary embolism.
This case is an example of an atypical distribution for pulmonary embolus, as pulmonary emboli preferentially are found in the lower lung segments.  Here, the upper lobes are predominately affected.  The differential diagnosis includes a lung mass versus mediastinal or hilar adenopathy with obstruction of pulmonary artery or veins.  However, the multiplicity of large multi-focal mismatched defects favors the high-probability interpretation.  The high probability V/Q scan coupled with the high pretest probability of PE, allows the clinican to recommend a prolonged course of anticoagulation therapy for this patient.
