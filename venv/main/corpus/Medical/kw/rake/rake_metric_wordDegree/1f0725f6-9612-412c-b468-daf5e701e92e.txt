No treatment needed unless continued growth causes impingment of adjacent nerve or vascular structure or causes delterious mass effect on adjacent soft tissues.  

Lesions should be followed over time and should stop growing after growth plate fusion.  Rarely, malignant degeneration to chondrosarcoma may occur and assessment of cartilagenous cap thickness can be performed using MRI.
Frontal radiograph of the knees and lateral radiograph of the right knee demonstrating multiple bilateral exophytic lesions about the distal femurs, proximal tibiae, and proximal fibulae.  The cortex and medullary cavities of these lesions are contiguous with those of the adjacent normal bone.
Multiple hereditary exostosis.
