pain worse with flexion and adduction
Further assessment: MRI or MR arthrography to assess for cartilage/labral damage.
Findings: increased osseous bump at femoral head neck junction with increased radius at the waist.  Due to rotation and pelvic tilt accurate determination of cross over sign and assessment of pincer type deformity limited; however, a component of pincer type appears present with prominent anterior acetabulum laterally to the posterior rim bilaterally.
Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome
DDx: ankylosing spondylitis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, congenital hip dysplasia
hip pain
CAM and Pincer Femoroacetabular Impingement:

Both types lead to premature osteoarthritis. The majority of cases of FAI are combination of the two basic mechanisms and are classified mixed cam-pincer impingement. 

Epidemiology: most active 20-40 age with estimated prevalence of 10%. Pincer type more often in females of middle age.  Most bilateral. 

Cam type: Nonspherical, (eliptical) femoral head at head-neck junction with increased radius at waist.  The bumps are located lateral in pistol grip deformity or anterosuperior. This leads to abutment against the acetabular rim primarily during adduction, internal rotation, flexion.  Associated damage to anteriorsuperior acetabular cartilage with separation between the labrum and cartilage in addition to damage at the subchondral tidemark.

Causes: idiopathic primary osseous variant due to growth abnormality of capital femoral epiphysis, subclinical slipped capital femoral epiphysis, Legg-Calv?-Perthes disease, coax vara, femoral retrotorsion, or after femoral neck fractures. 

Quantification: alpha angle of greater than 50 degrees, decreased anterior offset (difference in radius of head and neck), or offset ratio. 

Pincer type: Several methods of pincer impingement: Excessive cover of the femoral head (acetabular retroversion), deep acetabulum (coxa profunda), Protrusio, ossification of the labrum and negative acetabular index angle. 

The acetabular over coverage limits range of motion and leads to conflict between the femur and acetabulum.  Forces are transferred through labrum to acetabular cartilage with crushing the labrum and resulting degeneration and ossification of labrum. In contrast to CAM type the damage to the cartilage is restricted to a small thin strip near the labrum and is more circumferentially located.  Persistent abutment results in subluxaion with chondral damage posteroinferiorly termed a contrecoup lesion in 1/3 of cases and is a poor prognostic sign. Reactive ossification leads to further deepening of the acetabulum.

Anterior focal acetabular retroversion radiographically presents with the cross over sign with the anterior rim projecting lateral to the posterior rim.  The posterior rim may be deficient in anterior retroversion or dysplasia and project medial to the femoral head center. 
Alternatively the posterior wall sign is present with the posterior line lateral to the femoral head center indicating excessive posterior wall and is seen as an isolated entity, in hips with coax profunda, or protrusion acetabuli.

Deep acetabulum can be quantified by the lateral center edge angle, acetabular index or femoral head extrusion index.  Determination of pincer type deformity requires proper positioning to avoid false cross over signs often seen with increased pelvic tilt or rotation and avoiding of centering the radiograph beam on the hip which produces a pseudodeep acetabulum.

Secondary features: resulting ostoarthritic changes, os acetabulum – acetabular rim fracture, Herniation pits – radiolucencies with sclerotic margins in anterior proximal femoral neck.

Treatment: surgical
