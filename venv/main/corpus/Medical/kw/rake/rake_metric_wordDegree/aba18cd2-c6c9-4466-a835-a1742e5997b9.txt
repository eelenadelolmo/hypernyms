Texto: 
Right Ventricular heave 
S2 Heart Sound with fixed wide split 
Systolic ejection murmur 
Grade II of VI 
Heard best at left upper sternal border 
Mid-Diastolic Murmur 
Flow rumble in the tricuspid valve region
Wait and see: 
-Spontaneous closure is possible however, it is less common than with a VSD, and unusual outside of childhood.

Surgery Indications: 
-Large left to right shunt 
-Congestive Heart Failure 
-Pulmonary congestion
Radiographic findings:
Selected axial ECG gated white blood MR imgaes of the heart demonstrate a mild to moderately enlarged right atrium with a suggestion of a jet of low signal across the inter atrial septum. A defect is identified at the inferior aspect of the inter atrial septum. No significant shunt vascularity is appreciated.  The remaining heart is normal.
Atrial Septal Defect (ASD).Ostium primum.
-Atrial Septal Defect.
-Patent foramen Ovale
-Endocardial cushion defect (no other shunt or defect is present)
25 year old asymptomtic womam presents for a cardiac MRI after a murmur was detected by her cardiologist.
It is a commmon congenital cardiac anomaly, present in 3.8 of 10,000 live births. There is a 3:2 female predominance.

Types: 
Ostium Primum 
-Congenital opening in septum near AV valves 
-Associated with endocardial cushion defects. 
Ostium Secundum 
-Congenital defect at the fossa ovalis 
Sinus Venosus 
-Defect posterior to fossa ovalis 
-Associated with partial anomalous pulmonary return 

In additon, ASD's can be associated with Holt - Oram syndrome, Lutembacher syndrome, and Down syndrome.  They are more common in women then men.

Imaging should demonstrate a large RA, RV, and PA.  There should not be LA enlargment. MR can show a jet of blood across the defect.  The absence of signal in the inter atrial septum is not always reliable because the septum is typically thin and is not always seen.
