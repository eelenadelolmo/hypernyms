The patient underwent surgical resection of the mass and follow-up MR examinations have demonstrated no evidence of residual disease or recurrence.
Multiple representative MR images are demonstrated. A sagital T1 pre-contrast shows a predominantly low signal intensity midline extra-axial clival mass with some mass effect on the pons. An axial diffusion weighted image demonstrates no restricted diffusion. Coronal FLAIR and axial T2 images demonstrate that the mass is predominantly high in signal intensity.  Post gadolinium sagital and axial (fat sat) T1 images deomstrate enhancement within the mass.
