12 year old boy who presented to the ortho clinic for approximately 6 weeks of vague left hip pain. He had been receiving chiropratic for several months without improvement.
The symptoms of SCFE can be quite non-specific, a high index of suspicion is required for timely diagnosis.  Slipage of the contralateral hip is an increased risk, so inteval follow-up is indicated.
