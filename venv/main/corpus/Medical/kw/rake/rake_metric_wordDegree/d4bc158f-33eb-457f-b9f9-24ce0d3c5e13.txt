The most significant therapy for those with symptomatic ADPKD involves the management of hypertension and associated sequelae. Screening for MCA berry aneurysms.
Multiple, bilateral, cystic lesions are present on non-contrast MR.  Cysts do not enhance with contrast on MR.  3D MRA demonstrates the distribution of cysts.  There are no cystic lesions in the surrounding tissues or organs.
Autosomal Dominant "Adult" Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD).  

Family Hx revealed PT's father with history of HTN, RF, and subarachnoid hemmorhage.
