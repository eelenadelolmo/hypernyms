Palpable mass in the region of the pancreas
Endoscopic aspiration yielded no neoplastic cells.  Due to patients age and health status a non-operative approach was elected.
Large multilocular cystic mass with calcification.  The mass is located in the region of the pancreatic head and causes mass effect on the adjacent structures and vessels
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
pancreatic adenocarcinoma
microcystic adenoma
psuedocyst
78 year old women who presented to the Internal Medicine Clinic with 3 month history of epigastric pain.
Microcystic adenomas typically affect older women, 80% occur in women over 60 years old.  These are benign lesions which often demonstrate a central stellate scar.  These cells are typically rich in glycogen. Macrocystic adenocarcinoma typically occurs in the body and tail of the pancreas. These cells are typically mucinous.
