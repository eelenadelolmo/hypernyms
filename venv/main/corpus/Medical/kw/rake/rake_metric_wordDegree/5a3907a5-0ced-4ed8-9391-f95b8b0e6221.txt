Cholecystectomy
CR:
Supine radiograph of the abdomen demonstrates a non-obstructive gas pattern with multiple calcified stones in the right upper quadrant.  Erect view of the abdomen demonstrates calcifications overlying the right L5/S1 level, suggesting elongation of the gallbladder and concerning for significant distention.  There is a focal calcification suspicious for being located in the gallbladder neck.

CT:
Contrast enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrates elongation of the gallbladder (14 cm), gallbladder wall thickening, Pericholecystic inflammation, cholelithiasis, and a stone in the gallbladder neck.
Acute cholecystitis with Gall Stones (Calculus cholecystitis)
Acute calculus cholecystitis
Cholangitis
57 year old Nondiabetic female with a 2 day history of vague abdominal pain.
The patient had nonspecific symptoms of abdominal pain which was not localizable which confounded the clinician.  Considering the plain radiographic findings of elongation of the bladder and a suspicious calcification in the gallbladder neck, cholecystitis was high on the differential.  CT findings were strongly suspicious for acute calculus cholecystitis.  Subsequent surgery was confirmatory which demonstrated a diffusely hemorrhagic surface to the gallbladder with thick yellow purulent exudate adherent to the surface.  The CT findings were both sensitive and specific for acute calculus cholecystitis.
