Gen: Pt in no acute distress, alert and oriented x’s 3
CVS: rrr with no r/m/g
Pulm: ctab no r/w/r, no decreased lung sounds throughout
HEENT: unremarkable, no tracheal deviation
Ext: 2+ pulses throughout, no c/c/e
A pneumodart was placed and subsequent images showed a resolution of the pneumothorax. Pt improved clinically.
