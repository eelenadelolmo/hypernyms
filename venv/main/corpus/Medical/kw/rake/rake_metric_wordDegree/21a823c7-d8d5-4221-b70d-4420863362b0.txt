Afebrile
Unable to bear full weight on left leg without limping
Interosseus screw fixation was performed <1 day following the MRI study.
1. Unremarkable initial left femur and hip study.

2. Blood flow technically flawed due to late start.  Blood pool and bone phase images demonstrate intense linear uptake along the superior aspect of the trochanteric ridge concerning for stress fracture at risk of completion.  Age cannot be determined due to blood flow technical difficulties, but at least subacute due to 2-phase positive.

Mild diffusely increased radiotracer uptake is present in the bilateral
knees, distal tibiae (left greater than right), ankles (right greater than
left), midfeet (right greater than left), and the right lateral forefoot and
great toe.  These most likely represent stress reactive changes secondary to altered gait/weight-bearing mechanics.

3. There is a sclerotic focus extending greater than 50% through the left femoral neck with surrounding bone marrow edema, consistent with a near complete or complete nondisplaced femoral neck fracture. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable.

4. There has been interval interosseous screw fixation of the known left femoral neck fracture with 3 screws in the left femoral head and maintenance of anatomical alignment.
Femoral Neck Stress Fracture
Stress Fracture
Completed Fracture (Nondisplaced)
Osteomyelitis - unlikely but possible with bone scan findings.  However, the MRI confirms complete or near complete stress fracture.
31 year-old male with 2 months of worsening left hip and thigh pain.
In discussion with the Orthopedic surgery team caring for the patient, the decision to perform interosseus screw fixation is based on whether or not there is >50% extension through the femoral neck.  Therefore, the presence or absence of a complete fracture is therefore less clinically relevant for a patient who can receive definitive surgical care.
