Surgical resection

The immunostain results (positive R132H IDH1 staining, clonal p53 positivity, and negative EGFR expression) are consistent with the diagnosis of a diffuse fibrillary astrocytoma.  
The following immunostain results were obtained on B14:
      - p53: strong clonal staining in tumor cells.
      - IDH1 (R132H): strongly positive in tumor cells
      - EGFR: negative in tumor cells.
On the basis of focal increased cellularity and atypia, increased mitotic activity (at least three high-power-fields containing two mitoses each are noted), focal perivascular macrophages, and focal minor/rudimentary microvascular proliferation, it is felt that the tumor may be more aggressive
than is usual for grade 2 astrocytomas.
Minimally enhancing mass left temporal lobe.
Moderate amount of edema.  No hemorrhage.
Diffuse Astrocytoma, WHO 2-3, temporal lobe
• Herpes Encephalitis
• Resolving hematoma
• DNET
• Infiltrating glial neoplasm - astrocytoma vs. oligodendrglioma
23 year old man presents with a first time seizure. No fever.
1st MRI head: "....masslike expansion of the left temporal lobe involving primarily the medial aspect with cortical thickening of the mesial temporal lobe and hippocampus . There is elevated T2 hyperintense signal
involving the temporal lobe extending through the white matter tracts cephalad to the left basal ganglia and above the left occipital trigone and medial aspect of the left occipital lobe. The inferomedial left frontal lobe and anterior commissure also shows T2 hyperintense signal and there is
cortical thickening of the left frontal lobe. There is no evidence for enhancement within this region although a number of enhancing prominent medullary vessels course through the above area. ... Findings are concerning
for encephalitis or infiltrating glioma..."
2nd MRI head three week later: "...IMPRESSION: 1. Study obtained for stereotactic localization of lesion centered within the left temporal lobe. This lesion has not significantly changed since the prior studies. This is likely a glioma."
