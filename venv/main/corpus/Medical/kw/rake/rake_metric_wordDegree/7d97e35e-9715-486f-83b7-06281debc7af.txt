Patient should receive appropriate antibiotic therapy and follow-up radiographs to endure complete air-space resolution.  As an outpatient, his should be a community acquired pneumonia.
Air space disease is present in the left upper lobe and the superior segment of the left lower lobe. These are  matched to the large ventilation and perfusion defects on the V/Q study.
Triple Matched Defect - very low probability of a pulmonary embolus
None
50 year old man with shortness of breath during outpatient clinic visit.
In this case, the V/Q study was obtained first, followed by the radiograph.  If the radiograph would have been obtained first, it may have obviated the need for the nuclear medicine study.
