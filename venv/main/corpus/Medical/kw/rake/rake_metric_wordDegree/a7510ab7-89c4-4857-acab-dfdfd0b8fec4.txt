Deformity of the arm at the elbow.
Treatment for dislocation with coronoid process fracture depends on the type of coronoid fracture. Type I (avulsion of tip) and type II (involving <50%) are treated with closed reduction and early motion. Type III (>50% process) has high redislocation rate and requires ORIF.  If an associated MCL injury, surgical repair should be performed.

Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopedics.
AP and lateral views of the elbow in splint show posterior dislocation of the ulna with associated displaced coronoid process fracture.  Post reduction radiographs and 3D reconstruction from elbow CT show reduction of the posterior dislocation with anterosuperior displacement of the coronoid process.
Posterior ulnar dislocation with coronoid process fracture
Ulnar dislocation
Complicated ulnar dislocation with coronoid process fracture
45 y/o male presents to trauma center after motor vehicle collision.
Patient initially had closed reduction, will undergo ORIF.
