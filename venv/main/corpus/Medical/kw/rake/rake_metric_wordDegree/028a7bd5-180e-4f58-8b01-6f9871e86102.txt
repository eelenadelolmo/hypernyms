In the performed four-vessel cerebral DSA, delayed filling of both internal carotid arteries (ICAs) along with stasis and arrest of contrast at the carotid siphon levels was observed during a 60 second observation period. The vertebral arteries also demonstrated stasis (V3 level) and nonprogression of their respective contrast columns during a similar observation period (not shown).
Brain Death
Brain Death
Extreme intracranial pressure
Twelve days after sustaining a closed head injury, brain death was diagnosed (according to clinical and electroencephalographic criteria) in a 44-year-old woman. Since barbiturates were administered during the patient's hospitalization, a four-vessel, selective cerebral DSA was performed in order to confirm the diagnosis.
