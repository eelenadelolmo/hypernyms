PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

MENTAL STATUS:  Orientation x3.  Answers questions appropriately.  Appears to have some difficulty with short-term memory and completing simple commands.
Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  No visual field deficits on confrontation.
HEENT AND NECK:  No lymphadenopathy.
CHEST:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Benign.  No masses.
EXTREMITIES:  No skin lesions.  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Motor strength is 4/5 in the right upper extremity, 5/5 in the
left and in the lower extremities.  There are no sensory deficits.  Reflexes
are within normal limits in the upper extremities and lower extremities
bilaterally.  The patient has difficulties with random alternating movements
of the right upper extremity.  He also has some difficulty with gait and
proprioception of the right leg.

Laboratory:

BRONCHUS, RIGHT UPPER LOBE, TRANSBRONCHIAL BIOPSY:
  - ADENOCARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED
Palliative Radiation Followup.
Contrast Enhanced CT demonstrated multiple left frontal
ring-enhancing lesions, one 3x3 cm in size and the other 2x2 cm in size withsignificant surrounding vasogenic edema causing a midline shift of
approximately 3 mm and subfalcial herniation.  There is a third lesion in theleft parietal location, approximately 1x1 cm in size.  

CT of the chest demonstrated a 8-cm right upper lobe
mass with obstructive atelectasis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Additionally, there was a 2.5 cm spiculated mass in the left upper lobe.

Plain radiograph of the chest demonstrated an 8 cm mass in the right upper lobe with atelectasis.
Lung Adenocarcinoma and CNS Metastasis
Brain:
Metastatic Disease
Abscess

Lung:
Primary lung neoplasm
Metastatic disease to the lung
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 49-year-old male with a two-week history of right upper extremity weakness, loss of fine motor skills, and troubles with gait,presenting with mass in the lung and brain by CT exam and MRI, status postbronchoscopy with pathology pending.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49-year-old male who is anative of Saint Croix.  Approximately two weeks ago, he began noticing the first of several
difficulties.  He had problems with fine motor skills and difficulty inholding his pen.  His problems were on his right side.  He isright-handed.  He noticed also some gait abnormalities and trouble with
placement of his right foot.  He also began to develop headaches soonafter, which woke him up at night from sleep.  He was initially givenPercocet and had no relief from this medication.  He next tried ibuprofen andNaprosyn with some relief.  He denied any vision changes, hearing trouble,speech problems, or eating difficulty at any point.  Last Friday, he drove to
a local clinic for evaluation.   His primary presenting complaint was loss of fine motor skills in his right extremities and difficulty walking.
Initial CT of the head without contrast was ordered.  The findingsrevealed masses within the brain with brain edema in the left hemispheresuperior to the left lateral ventricle with midline shift. He was airlifted
to a medical treatment facility for further evaluation.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient notes no fevers, however, he has had chills and nightsweats over the last two weeks.  He also notes 17-pound weight loss for thelast four months.  Furthermore, he also has noted word-finding difficulty in the last two weeks with some memory loss.  He also has gait difficulties andsome fine motor skill difficulties on the right side.  He denies any left-sided difficulties and only motor deficits on the right side.  No sensory deficits.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He smoked cigarettes for approximately 20 years, one packper day for a 20-pack year history.  He quit smoking5 months ago.
This patient's presenting complaint to his primary care physician was headache and a history of progressive neurological symptoms.  His metastatic disease was the presenting manifestation.  Surprisingly, he did not note respiratory symptoms.

Multiple ring enhancing lesions in the brain and a chest radiograph demonstrating a large mass determined the etiology in this case.
