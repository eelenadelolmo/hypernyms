WBC 10.6 - normal
ESR 12 - normal
C-reactive protein 0.9 - normal
Patient went to surgery and debridement, tissue examination demonstrated chronic inflammation and regenerating bone consistent with chronic osteomyelitis. No organisms cultured.
Skin biopsy - inflammation and fibrosis.
Frontal and lateral radiographs demonstrate a large lucent lesion located centrally within the distal metaphysis of the distal femur, extending to the epiphysis.  There is a sclerotic rim and no evidence of a periosteal reaction, cortical break or matrix.

There is a large, 12 x 2 x 2-cm abnormal signal within the marrow space of the distal femur, which demonstrates low signal on T1 and high signal on T2 images.  This lesion enhances intensely after gadolinium administration. The bony sequestrum is noted on the CT reformatted images.  There is a sinus tract extending posteriorly from the medullary cavity to the posterior cortex in the distal metaphysis.
Osteomyelitis, chronic, no organisms cultured
Chronic Osteomyelitis (Brodie&#39;s Abscess)
Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (Eosinophilic Granuloma)
Fibrosarcoma
Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma
Primary Lymphoma
21 y.o. man with orsening pain in his knee
Patient had a prior history of osteomyelitis in the distal femur that was debrided.
