Findings: There is a T2 high signal, T1 mostly low signal mass that is ill define and located at the right posterior parietal and temporal lobe and extends across the corpus collosum to the contralateral side.  There is mass effect to the left.  There is irregular enhancement.  Prior surgery was performed on the right.  C-spine images show a rim or coating of enhancement around the spinal cord and cerebellum consistent with metastatic disease.
