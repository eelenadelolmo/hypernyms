Relevant physical findings: inguinal lymphadenopathy with 2+ large inguinal lymph nodes noted symmetrically.  Palpable baseball sized mass in the right buttock.
• Treatment was initiated along the lines of ARST0431 protocol:
VDARAC protocol consisting of vincristine, cytotoxin, mesna, and 
andromycin (with antiemetics for nausea); 10 d course of Neupogen; Bactrim prophylaxis three times a week (for Pneumocystis)

• Prophylaxis for peptic ulcers and antiviral (Acyclovir) prophylaxis

• Patient was followed up by Heme/Onc for chemotherapy and by primary care. Patient did have a subsequent admission for sepsis but was hospital course was uncomplicated and patient was treated successfully.
• R-Hip Ultrasound:
solid-appearing with some internal vascularity in the inferior gluteal crease of the right buttock estimated to be 4.8 x 3.1 cm

• CT:
1. large perineal mass mearsuring approximately 8.3 cm transverse x 8.6 cm AP centered to the right of midline in the perineum with the superior aspect of mass surrounding the anus; also bilateral inguinal lymph nodes
2. multiple lung nodules
3. conglomeration of small paraaortic lymph nodes 

• MR pelvis (with gadolinium):
1. Large soft tissue mass (7.7 cm transverse x 7.8 cm AP x 10 cm superior to inferior) centered in the perineal region just right of midline, and surrounding the anus at its superior aspect. 
2. No invasion of the gluteal or obturator muscles. 
3. There is abnormal signal and enhancement in the right ischium and ilium extending to the supra-acetabular region
4. There are numerous bone lesions and enlarged enhancing bilateral inguinal lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease. 
5. Enlarged, enhancing inguinal lymph nodes bilaterally. 

• Bone Scan:
Increased uptake is present in the right ischium and inferior pubic ramus, sacrum, right-sided ribs in the midthoracic region  and right scapula.
Rhabdomyosarcoma, alveolar type
Differential (would vary by age of patient and body location and other symptoms present)
 
• Soft tissue mass - Malignant or benign
- Non-rhabdomyosarcoma sarcoma
- Lipoma
• Infiltrative process 
• Abscess 
• Hernia (on trunk)
15 year old boy presents to his primary care doctor for his annual physical with a palpable, painful R-sided gluteal mass x 2.5 months. The pain has progressively worsened and now the patient reports numbness and tingling in his right lower extremity on prolonged sitting. Patient has lost weight (8-10 lbs) in the last 2 months.  He denies fevers, chills, night sweats. 

ROS negative except as stated above
No other medical conditions
