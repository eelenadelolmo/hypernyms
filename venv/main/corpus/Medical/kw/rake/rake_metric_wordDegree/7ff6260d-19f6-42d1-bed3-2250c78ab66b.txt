Pain and swelling of elbow greatest medially
Orthopedic Surgery Consult for surgical repair and followup.
Plain radiographs obtained after splinting demonstrate elbow effusion and displaced medial epicondyle within the elbow joint between the trochlea and olecranon.
Medial Epicondyle Avulsion, entrapment between trochlea and olecranon
None
13 y/o male baseball player with acute elbow pain, after a fall.
When evaluating elbow radiographs in children it is important to remember the typical order of ossification (CRITOE):  capitellum, radial head, internal (medial) epicondyle, trochlea, olecranon, and external (lateral) epicondyle.  Therefore, if the trochlea is ossified you should see the ossified medial epicondyle.

Acute medial epicondyle avulsion occurs with throwing, falls, and 50% of elbow dislocations.  This patient presented from outside facility following reduction of elbow dislocation and splinting.  Entrapment of the avulsed medial epicondyle between olecranon and trochlea occurs in 20% of disclocations.  Effusion may or may not be present. The medial epicondyle is extracapsular after age 2, so effusion may indicate another fracture or be due to dislocation.  If avulsed fragment is displaced >5mm or entrapped, then surgery is required.  Ulnar nerve injury is associated with dislocation in 25-50% of cases.
