Tenderness to palpation, LLQ
Supportive, low residue diet.  In cases with abscess, antibiotics are needed.  Percutaneous and open drainage may be required.
Barium enema shows multiple small outpouchings from the distal descending and sigmoid colon.  There is persistent effacement of the sigmoid colon - probably from an adjacent diverticular abscess.
Diverticular disease
• Diverticulosis
• Diverticulitis
• Lymphoma
• Colon Cancer
45 y.o. woman with persistent left lower quadrant pain for two weeks, somewhat relieved with defecation
Diverticulitis is often reserved for inflammation outside or around the diverticula - rather than infection within a diverticulum.  Localized abscess may form around the infected diverticula.

In 1987, it was suggested that percutaneous image-guided drainage would reduce the need for surgery. PMID: 3602369

A retrospective review has shown the efficacy of non-surgical management.   Antibiotic therapy may be effective for abscess < 3cm.  CT-guided percutaneous drainage of diverticular abscesses < 4.1 cm diameter is effective in most cases; while larger abscesses may still require operation.  PMID: 16498095
