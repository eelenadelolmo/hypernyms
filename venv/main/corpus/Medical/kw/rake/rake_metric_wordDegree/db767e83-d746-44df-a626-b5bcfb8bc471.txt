Patient is a 22 year old woman who had a miscarriage 1 week after being involved in an automobile accident.  It is a credit to the treating doctor of chiropractic that the appropriate referrals were made for evaluation.  Patient at that time was 17weeks pregnant. 2 months later she experienced sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. CT of chest was consistent with PE. Risk factors for pulmonary embolism in this patient includes recent pregnancy and decreased ambulation post accident.   The patient is improving with chiropractic treatment received.
