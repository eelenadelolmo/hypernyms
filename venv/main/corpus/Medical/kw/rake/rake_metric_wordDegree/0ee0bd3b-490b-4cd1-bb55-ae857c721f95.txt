Prior to MRI of the neck, fine needle aspiration of the right parotid mass showed malignant cells consistent with a poorly differentiated carcinoma.
2 cm relatively well circumscribed right parotid mass centered between the superficial and deep lobes.  Slightly heterogeneous on T1WI and T2WI.  Appears isointense to normal parotid with mild enhancement post-GAD on T1WI. No particularly aggressive features, ie not invading surrounding normal tissue and spaces.
Parotid Tumor (Carcinoma by FNA)
-Primary salivary neoplasm (benign vs malignant)
-Neurofibroma
-Lymphadenopathy
The patient is a 56 year old male with a right parotid mass and paralysis of the marginal mandibular branch of the right facial nerve.
Facial nerve involvement suggests malignancy.
