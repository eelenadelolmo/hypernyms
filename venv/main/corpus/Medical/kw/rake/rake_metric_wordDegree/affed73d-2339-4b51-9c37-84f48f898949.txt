Positive Lachman's test and Anterior drawer sign.
Patient was referred to Orthopedic Surgery.  Depending on the level of activity, treatment may range from isolated meniscal repair to ACL reconstruction.
The anterior medial fibers of the anterior cruciate ligament are disrupted.  There appear to be some intact fibers of the posterior lateral portion (not shown).

A horizontal cleavage tear is present within the medial meniscus which extends to the inferior articular surface. Abnormal high signal extends into the medial collateral ligament both inferiorly and superiorly creating a partial meniscocapsular separation.

The lateral meniscus, posterior cruciate ligament and the lateral collateral ligament complex are intact.
O'Donoghue's 'Unhappy Triad'
O'Donoghue's 'Unhappy Triad' - ACL, MCL and medial meniscus injury
Isolated ACL injury
32 year-old man with right knee laxity that began following remote injury.
In the 1950's, O'Donoghue's 'Unhappy Triad' was originally described as a combined injury occurring following rotation and valgus stress causing medial joint compartment distraction.  Later research has shown that this 'classical' presentation is actually uncommon and that lateral meniscal injury is more frequently encountered.  However, medial meniscal injury does occur with increased regularity as a sequelae of chronic, unrepaired ACL injuries as in the patient.
