Chemotherapy and palliative therapy were provided.
• Sagittal T1, axial T2, and axial T1 contrast enhanced MRI images of the brain show multiple, bilateral, and aggressive masses within the brain parenchyma. 

• The masses are bright on T1WI, show relatively extensive surrounding edema on T2WI, and enhance following administration of gadolinium.
Metastatic Melanoma
• Multiple, bilateral, and aggressive lesions suggests hematogenous metastatic disease as a likely possibility.

• T1 hyperintensity implies the presence of fat, melanin, gadolinium, or methemoglobin.

Taken together, metastatic melanoma becomes the most reasonable best diagnosis.
This 59 year-old man presents with new onset seizures. 
(Hx of a prior illness is witheld.)
