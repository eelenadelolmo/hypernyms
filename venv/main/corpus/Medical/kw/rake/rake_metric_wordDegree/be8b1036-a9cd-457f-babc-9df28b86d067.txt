Texto: 
Abdominal pain, distension; elevated amylase and lipase.
Treatment
•	Sterile necrosis- conservative treatment
o	Aggressive crystalloid resuscitation 
o	NPO (minimal pancreatic stimulation)
o	Gastric decompression
o	Intravenous narcotics
o	Nasojejunal nutrition or TPN
o	Glucose control with IV insulin
o	Antibiotic prophylaxis- early empiric use of carbapenems with signs of infection
•	Early surgical intervention contraindicated except in abdominal compartment syndrome
•	Gallstone impaction and biliary obstruction- urgent ERCP
•	Infected necrosis and sepsis with persistent clinical decline- open surgical necrosectomy and/or percutaneous drainage (questionable benefit over surgery alone)
Axial contrast enhanced CT images of the abdomen demonstrates nonenhancement of the majority of the pancreas with extensive peripancreatic fat stranding and retroperitoneal fluid. Associated small bowel dilation consistent with ileus and pleural effusions.
Necrotizing Pancreatitis
Necrotizing Pancreatitis- specific clinical presentation and imaging
Pancreatic or ampullary mass with massive duct dilation
One week progressive epigastric pain; negative cardiac workup.
This patient clinically improved with non-operative management suggesting sterile necrosis.
