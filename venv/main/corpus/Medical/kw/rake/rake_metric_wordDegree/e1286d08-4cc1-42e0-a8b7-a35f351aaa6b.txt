Coronal sonographic image demonstrates echogenic blood at the right caudothalamic notch.  With the patient lying on the right side of his face, dependent layering of echogenic blood within the ventricles creates the “hematocrit effect” (blood-CSF fluid levels).   

Sagittal sonographic image with the patient’s head in neutral supine position demonstrates dependent layering of echogenic blood within the ventricle creating the “hematocrit effect” (blood-CSF fluid levels).
Grade III Intraventricular Hemorrhage with hydrocephalus and hematocrit effect.
None
26-week gestation premature infant boy referred to rule out intraventricular hemorrhage.
The germinal matrix is a fetal structure that is a stem source for neuroblasts.  It typically involutes by term but is still present in premature infants.  It is highly vascular and prone to hemorrhaging.  Germinal matrix hemorrhage is seen on ultrasonography as an ovoid echogenic mass within the caudothalamic groove.  They are categorized into one of four grades.

Grade I: Hemorrhage confined to germinal matrix
Grade II: Intraventricular hemorrhage without ventricular dilatation
Grade III:  Intraventricular hemorrhage with ventricular dilatation
Grade IV: Intraparenchymal hemorrhage (thought to be secondary to venous infarction rather than direct extension of hemorrhage)

Our case is an example of Grade III intraventricular hemorrhage.  The interesting feature however is the sonographic appearance of the hematocrit effect of blood within cerebrospinal fluid. The patient was lying on the right side of his face and hence secondary to gravity, the echogenic dense blood layers dependently within both ventricles yielding the blood-fluid level (hematocrit effect).  

When the patient’s head was repositioned to a neutral supine position, the echogenic blood layered again dependently, posteriorly and inferiorly within both ventricles.
