There are three threaded screws traversing the superior lateral aspect of the humeral head, stabilizing an osteochondral graft for repair of a Hill-Sachs deformity.  There are additional partially threaded screws traversing the glenoid for repair of a bony Bankart lesion.  There is satisfactory glenohumeral alignment.
