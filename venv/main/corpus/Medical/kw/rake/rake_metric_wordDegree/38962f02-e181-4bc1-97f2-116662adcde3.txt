• Day of Chest CT Imaging:
Infant was pink and his perfusion was good. 
Weight 2215g 
Baby had slight aspirate, but this could be due to continuous feedings  
Remained on a ventilator, rate of 35, pressure of 24/5, and about 35% oxygen
Most recent blood gas at time of case write up showed slightly high CO2 of 68 and normal pH
PAP and PEEP of 24 and 5 cm water respectively

• Most recent physical exam:
FIO2 of 35%.  
Electrolytes normal
BUN and creatinine normal 
Total fluid intake was at 160 mL/kg/day and urine output was adequate at 3.5 mL/kg/hour
Blood gases normal
The neonatal intensivist will monitor the infant very closely for infection and start the infant on TPN tiny baby protocol.  Blood gases will be monitored closely.  Pediatric cardiology will follow as patient grows.
• Hypoplastic Right lung
• Dilatation of the main (1 cm) and left pulmonary artery with hypoplasia of the right pulmonary artery. 
• Abnormal pulmonary venous return:
» Evidence that the right upper pulmonary veins drain into the scimitar vein
» Large scimitar vein draining the right lower lobe, which empties into the suprahepatic IVC; Scimitar vein measures 3.5 mm
• Systemic arterialization of the right lower lobe from an artery arising from the upper abdominal aorta just below the celiac artery as well as through a dilated segmental artery rising from the aorta at the T8 level. 

Not seen on the images provided but evident on echocardiography:

• Moderate to large ASD. 
• Apical VSD
Scimitar Syndrome
• Scimitar syndrome
• Respiratory distress failure secondary to surfactant deficiency
• Prematurity 26 weeks gestation
This is a 2m4w old infant born prematurely at 26 and 4/7th weeks gestation and has been hospitalized since birth. He received surfactant in the delivery room and was transferred to NICU on CPAP.
Patient was a premature infant that suffered from Scimitar syndrome. Radiological imaging was done to confirm differential diagnosis. Right lung hypoplasia and scimitar vein, among other findings, were revealed.
