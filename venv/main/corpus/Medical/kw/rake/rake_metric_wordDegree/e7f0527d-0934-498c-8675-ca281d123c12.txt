Abdomen: non-distended, NABS without bruits.  No tenderness to palpation.  No guarding or rebound. 
Back: mild right CVA tenderness. 

Creat 2.4
Multiple axial CT views of the abdomen without contrast demonstrating an enlarged right kidney with loss of intrapelvic  fat, right-sided dilation of collecting system with proximal right ureteral dilatation.  No evidence of radiopaque stone in bilateral ureters.  Small stone in right collecting system.
Right hydronephrosis
-left-sided hydronephrosis
-radiolucent stone secondary to protease inhibitor therapy
-radiopaque stone undetected on CT
-obstruction secondary to neoplasm
59 year-old HIV positive male, on HAART, presenting with 4 day history of right flank and abdominal pain.  History of nephrolithiasis since beginning protease inhibitor therapy.
Protease inhibitor associated nephrolithiasis is classically seen with indinavir, in which 10-25% of adult patients taking the drug can develop stones.  The stones are classically radiolucent on CT.  Given the poor kidney function in this patient, intravenous contrast was unable to be administered.  However, such a study would be effective in evaluating for a filling defect within the right ureter as a cause of the hydronephrosis.  Other options for further radiological evaluation would include intravenous pyelogram and retrograde pyelography.  However, due to decreased renal function, no additional studies were obtained, and the case was managed as a presumed stone.
