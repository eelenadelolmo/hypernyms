The patient had an ostium secundum type atrial septal defect.
Percutaneous catheter delivered devices have become popular for the closure of atrial septal defects.  These devices consist of two umbrella like or clam shell segments that clamp the atrial septum between them to cover the defect.  They are most commonly used in patients with small to moderate sized ostium secundum type defects in which there is enough surrounding tissue to anchor the device in place. 

Contraindications to Percutaneous Repair include:
Resting pulmonary hypertension
Non-secundum type ASD 
Insufficient septal rims
Pregnancy
An extensive congenital cardiac anomaly
Recent infection or sepsis
Contraindication to antiplatelets
Intracardiac thrombi

Some common types of closure devices include the Amplatzer, CardioSeal/Starflex, Helex, and PFOStar.
