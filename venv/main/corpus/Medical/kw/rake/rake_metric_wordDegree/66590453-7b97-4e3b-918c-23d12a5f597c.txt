Disruption of the fibers of the ACL are diagnostic of a tear but there are other associated findings which suggest that a tear is present. The Segond fracture is a fracture of the lateral tibial plateau at the insertion site of LCL and is highly suggestive of a ACL tear. There is also a high association of MCL tears with ACL injuries.
Complete disruption of the ACL fibers as well as increased T2 signal within it representing edema. On the T2 images, there is hyperintensity within the distal femur and proximal tibia representing bone marrow edema. No fractures are present.
