The follow up ultrasound images are added.  Note the cerebellum and the overall cerebral hemispheres are not that different in diameter.  The thalami are partially fused and there is a C-shaped venticle.
Like prenatally, the imaging was limited as there was a very small anterior fontanelle.
Initial ultrasound demonstrated a small overall size to the head in comparison to expected dating by prior LMP and in relationship to abdominal and femur lenght biometry.  It was difficult to get adequate imaging of the frontal portion of the brain parenchyma as an acoustic window (usually the anterior fontanelle) was difficult to find.  Despite the overall small biparietal diameter and head circumference, the cerebellum was enlarged for expected dates.  The cerebellum generally grows approximately 1mm per week gestational age.  The bioccular and interoccular distances were at the low end of normal at the time of this scan.  The anterior falx and septum pellucidum were not demonstrated.  Also noted were bilaterally small kidneys.  Kidneys, like the cerebellum generally grow 1mm per week of gestational age.
Semilobar Holoprosencephaly - as part of a Trisomy 13 ring abnormality.
For the Brain - concern was for a semilobar holoprosencephaly.

Given the renal and cerebellar abnormalities in addition, a search was done through the book of Fetal Syndromes
G1P0 mother presenting for a second trimester anatomic screening ultrasound.  Pregnancy uncomplicated.
Like with many of the anatomic abnormalities, there are findings at birth that are grossly obvious and yet difficult to appreciate at the time of a 18-20wk anatomic ultrasound prenatally.  Depending on the degree of growth abnormality, findings may be at the low end of normal at 18 wks and far below normal at birth.  This was the case with the biocular measurements.  As a cautionary note to ultrasonologists, if a measurement or ratio is minimally "off", the safe measure is to bring the patient back for a follow up in 6-8 weeks.  Things that are not growing appropriately become significantly more divergent in third trimester.
