Mildly jaundiced.  Abdomen mildly distended, hypoactive bowel sounds.
Patient underwent emergency surgical correction of volvulus. Bowel untwisted in a counterclockwise fashion. In addition, the Ladd procedure was performed, fixing the malrotated bowel by dividing adhesions between the duodenum and cecum at the base of the mesentery, passing a tube through the duodenum to rule out any associated duodenal obstruction, and finally placing viable bowel in a position of nonrotation (ie, small bowel on the right and colon on the left). Incidental appendectomy was also performed. Bowel was viable in this case and patient had good post-op recovery with positive PO feeding and stool.
CXR- Dilated stomach bubble.
Upper GI- Dilated duodenum and stomach with contrast filling. No contrast distal to 2nd portion of duodenum.
Ultrasound 1- SMV directly anterior to SMA 
Ultrasound 2 -  Target sign, mesentery and bowel twisted around mesenteric vessels.
Post-op Abdominal film- Contrast and air in small bowel on right and large bowel on left.
Intestinal malrotation with midgut volvulus
1) Malrotation +/- Midgut volvulus     
2) Duodenal atresia              
3) Duodenal web
4) Extrinsic duodenal obstruction
5) Necrotizing enterocolitis
4 day-old male with 2 days of bilious vomiting
Midgut malrotation occurs in 1/6000 live births. Two-thirds of cases going to surgery occur in patients <1 month of age.   Rotational anomalies occur as a result of an arrest of normal rotation of the embryonic gut. Axis of malrotation is the superior mesenteric artery. Malrotation may show duodenum under right hemidiaphragm, failing to cross midline from right to left.  Normally, the superior mesenteric vein is anterior and to the right of the SMA. An SMV that lies directly anterior or to the left of the SMA suggests malrotation.  Vomiting is the most common presentation in 1st week of life for volvulus.  Radiologic evaluation typically begins with plain radiographs, followed by an upper GI contrast series, which is the best examination to visualize the duodenum. Barium enema and ultrasonography can be useful adjuncts when abnormal findings are present, but normal findings do not exclude malrotation.  Emergent surgical reduction is primary treatment.
