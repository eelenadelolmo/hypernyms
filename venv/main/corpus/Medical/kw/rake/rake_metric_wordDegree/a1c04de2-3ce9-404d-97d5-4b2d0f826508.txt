Heart: NSR
Full Bruce GXT protocol to 8:51 min stopped due to maximum effort.  Maximum heart rate achieved was 172 bpm with an 85% maximum predicted heart rate of
144 bpm.  Maximum SBP was 165 mmHg.  Patient experienced no symptoms, and no
diagnostic EKG changes were noted.
None
The post-stress images (which were gated) demonstrated significant breast attenuation artifact which resolved when patient was imaged in a prone position.  The rest images reveal significantly less evidence of breast attenuation.  There are no findings (following comparison of the "prone" set of post-stress images to the rest thallium images, particularly with normal wall motion on gating) to suggest ischemia or infarct. The normal gating is not shown.
Shifting Breast Attenuation (imaging characteristics)
-Shifting Breast Attenuation Artifact
-Myocardial ischemia (prior to prone imaging)
Periodic Chest pain with previous equivocal GXT
In some women the overlying soft tissue of the breast causes attenuation of activity from the heart.  This reduces the overall number of counts available for creating the image and can also result in artifactual defects.  A breast binder can be used to flatten the tissue and hold the breast in the same position between post-stress and rest imaging.  Usually, ensuring woman are consistently imaged with or without a bra at both post-stress and rest, and gating the images, is adequate to significantly alleviate this confounding factor.  Alternatively, the patient can be imaged in the prone position.
