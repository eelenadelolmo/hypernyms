The patient's abdomen was distended but soft and non tender. 
The laboratory values were unremarkable.
Surgical correction.  The patient had an uncomplicated post-operative course.
An UGI study was performed under flouroscopic evaluation using 50 cc of Isovue.  Contrast easily passed into the stomach, as well as, the first portion of the duodenum.  However, no contrast was seen to flow past the first portion of the duodenum.  Intermittent flouroscopy imaging was done for aprroximately 30 minutes without visualization of contrast past this point.  On flouroscopic images, contrast is seen to fill the antrum and duodenal bulb.  There is tapering of contrast distal to the duodenal bulb.

Malrotation and midgut volvulus
4-day old full-term white male infant was originally taken to an outside facility for a 2-day history of bilious emesis.  The pregnancy and labor had been without complications.  This was an experienced mother who was currrently nursing.  Plain radiographs from the outside hopsital were reported as nonspecific.  The patient was then transferred to our facility for an UGI study.
A UGI series is the preferred diagnostic test for malrotation with midgut volvulus. The UGI series is performed with contrast administered either by bottle or through a nasogastric tube.  The expected location of the normal duodenal-jejunal junction is to the left of the left-sided spinal pedicle at the level of the duodenal bulb.  The duodenal C-sweep courses posteriorly, inferiorly, anteriorly and leftward crossing the midline, then superiorly. 

In malrotation without volvulus, one may see the duodenal-jejunal junction displaced downward and to the right on the frontal view.  An abnormal position of the jejunum (lying on right side of abdomen) should alert one to the possibility of a malrotation but should not be relied upon to either make or exclude the diagnosis.
 
In malrotation with midgut volvulus, findings also include a dilated, fluid-filled duodenum, proximal small bowel obstruction, or a "corkscrew" pattern (proximal jejunum spiraling downward in the right or mid upper abdomen).

In this case of malrotation with midgut volvulus, contrast is seen to fill the first portion of the duodenum without progressing further.  An abrupt tapering of contrast material is appreciated consistent with volvulus.
