Pulmonay referral and follow up.
Chest radiographs (PA and lateral) reveal bilateral hilar fullness as well as a thin linear opacity at the lower left lateral lung field.

Noncontrast CT examination of of the chest demonstrates bilateral hilar adenopathy as well as mediastinal adenopathy.  Within the lung parenchyma, a small linear opacity is seen within the left lower lobe consistent with atelectasis versus scarring.  Otherwise the pulmonary parenchyma was unremarkable.
Pulmonary Sarcoidosis
Considerations for mediastinal adenopathy include: infection (e.g. TB or fungal infection), inflammation (e.g. sarcoidosis), neoplasm (e.g. lymphoma), and idiopathic (e.g. Castleman's Disease).
36 year old African-American male presents with shortness of breath and a persistent cough.
This diagnosis was new for this individual.
