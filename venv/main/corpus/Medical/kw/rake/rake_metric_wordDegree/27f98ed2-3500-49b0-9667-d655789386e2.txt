Correction of chest was deformity was accomplished by the Nuss procedure.  Follow up inclueds serial chest radiographs with removal of Nuss bar after 2-3 years when chest cartilage has reformed.
A marked pectus excavatum deformity is present
with resultant shift of inferior mediastinal structures to the left.  Pt is status post pectus excavatum correction via Nuss procedure as demonstrated by the metalic band across chest on plain film.
Pectus excavatum
Pectus excavatum
18 y.o. assymptomatic male presented for pectus excavatum correction.
Surgical repair of pectus excavatum was first achieved in 1911 and methods of repair have evolved since then.  

Common surgical operations to correct pectus excavatum include the Ravitch and Nuss procedures.  In this case, the Nuss procedure was used which entails placing a custom bent metal bar across the chest to mechanically raise the sternum and remodel the cartilage.  Echocardiogram, pulmonary function tests, and/or computed tomography (CT) scan are routine pre-operative studies.
