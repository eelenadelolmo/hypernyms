Chondrosarcoma is managed similarly to osteosarcoma, with radical surgery being the treatment of choice.  When only excision is employed, 90% of tumors recur locally.  The overall 10 year survival rate following surgery is approximately 65%.  Radiation therapy as the primary modality for chondrosarcoma is limited.  Pulmonary metastasis occur, but the value of chemotherapy is not well established.  Doxorubicin yields a response rate of only 17% for metastatic chondrosarcoma.
1) Plain films- normal SI joints, ill defined lucent area over lower left sacrum, two sacral neural foramina on left widened with erosions of borders
2) CT- mass left side of sacrum, left side of S1 encroaching on left side neural foramen, normal vertebral bodies
3) MRI- infiltrating lesion with high T2 signal intensity within body of sacrum infiltrating into the epidural space
High-grade chondroid neoplasm
metastatic disease, primary bone tumor, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, giant cell tumor, and chondroma
45 y/o white male initially presented with five week hx of left buttock burning pain and numbness extending into lower thigh.  Initially treated with NSAIDS and physical therapy, symptoms continued to worsen.  Presented to WRAMC with numbness and tingling extending into left testicle and penis.  Patient denies bowel or bladder incontinence, weight loss, or other constitutional symptoms.  Denies any numbness, pain, or abnormal sensations on right side.

PSHx: remote tonsillectomy/ bilateral herniorrhaphy
MEDS: Ramipril 5 mg PO qd, HCTZ 12.5 mg PO qd, Amitryptyline 25 mg PO qd, Zocor 10 mg PO qd
