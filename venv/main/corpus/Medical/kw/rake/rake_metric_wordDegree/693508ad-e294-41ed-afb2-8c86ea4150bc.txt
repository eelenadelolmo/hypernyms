Texto: 
Right knee without erythema, swelling or deformity. Normal strength and range of motion. Mild effusion. Increased crepitus with patellar subluxation compared to the left. Tender to palpation along the medial aspect of the joint line and medial femoral condyle.
Range of Motion: Diminished cervical flexion, extension, right and left lateral bending and rotation, lumbar flexion and extension. 
Strength: Grip strength was diminished on the right side (her dominant hand). 4/5 flexor and extensor halluces
Reflexes: 2/4 biceps, triceps, patellar and Achilles reflexes
Sensation: Diminished sensation to light touch over the dorsal aspects of the right 1st and second digits. Diminished light touch sensation over the bilateral, plantar toes.
Other: Valgus/varus stress testing revealed laxity in valgus stress.  The Lachman&#39;s test was unremarkable.  The McMurrary test was positive with limited extension of the knee.  The AP drawer testing did not reveal laxity.  The Patellar grind procedure was positive.  Pain radiating to the right shoulder with cervical compression. Hawkins-Kennedy and supraspinatus procedures positive bilaterally. Positive straight leg raise bilaterally. Painful percussion over most of the spine with associated paraspinal muscle spasm and tenderness.
The lesion in the right femur has radiographic findings consistent with an enchondroma. It contains rings and arcs of calcifications with an overall scalloped appearance. These areas are intense on T2 and have moderate intensity on T1. There is no “double-ring sign” which would be consistent with a bone infarct. Chondrosarcoma is also less likely, given the lack of cortical penetration or soft-tissue involvement. Observation without intervention was chosen.
Right knee pain was likely secondary to the bone bruise of the medial epicondyle. Conservative treatment with NSAIDs and rest were recommended. At a followup appointment 3 months after the fall, pain had resolved.
Neck pain was thought to be secondary to sprain/strain. Left shoulder pain was due to cervical radiculopathy and supraspinatus tendonopathy. Low back pain was due to lumbar disc herniation and muscle spasm. Patient received ultrasound, Estim, flexion distraction, and chiropractic manipulation therapies. She was instructed to perform low back and core strength exercises and to use a cervical traction collar for 30 minutes per day.
On follow-up exam 2 months after the MVA, patient continued to report severe pain-related impairment based on the Pain Disability Questionnaire [1]. Oswestry Back Pain score was consistent with a “crippled” status based upon the patient’s responses [2]. Her neck disability index was consistent with severe disability [3]. She continued to have severe limitation of the range of motion of the neck and lumbar spine. Straight leg raise testing was positive bilaterally. She had tenderness of the bilateral paraspinal and gluteus muscles on algometry testing [4].
Right knee:
Intact cruciate and collateral ligaments. Intact quadriceps and patellar tendons. Increased signal within the posterior horn of the medial meniscus not extending to the articular surface. Bone marrow edema within the medial femoral condyle. No fractures. 13 mm enchondroma of the distal femur. Mild patellar cartilage thinning.

Cervical Spine: 
C3-C4: Minimal disc bulge without central or foraminal stenosis. 
C4-C5: focus of increased signal in the anterior annulus, possibly a ventral annular tear.
 C5-C6: mild disc bulge without central or foraminal stenosis. 

Lumbar spine: 
L3-L4 and L5-S1: Disc dehydration, small central to right paracentral disc herniation with slight indentation of the thecal sac. This has decreased in size since prior study in August of 2007. 
L4-5 disc dehydration, increased signal within the posterior annulus and moderate disc bulge. This is increased in size since prior study.
L5-S1: disc space narrowing, increased signal within the posterior annulus. Moderate central disc herniation impinging on the ventral aspect of the thecal sac.

42 year old female with Hx of HTN and chronic back and neck pain presents after a slip and fall on the ice. Patient reports that 3 months ago she slipped on ice and struck her right knee. She has no complaint of knee pain currently. She is able to walk on the knee. Denies any fever, redness or swelling of the joint at this time.
History is complicated by a history of MVA 2 months ago, after which patient developed neck pain, back pain and headaches which limit her functional status and had not been present previously. Patient was the belted driver of a stopped vehicle that was struck from behind. She was examined in the emergency department, where no imaging was performed, and was discharged with muscle relaxants. Back pain radiates into the 3rd and 4th digits of the right hand and she develops a tingling sensation in her right thigh when driving. Neck pain radiates into the left shoulder. Patient presented to orthopedist, where she was prescribed a steroid, and to physical therapy. She is also taking aspirin and baclofen. These treatments have not relieved her pain.

Medications: Aspirin, Lipitor, Vitamin D, Baclofen, Prednisone

PMH: Hypertension

PSH: Caesarean section, tubal ligation, right foot neuroma removal

Given that the enchondroma was asymptomatic and there was no evidence of pathologic fracture or malignancy. Observation of the lesion was appropriately chosen.  Please refer to the topic that is linked to this case for contingency approaches should the imaging aspects of enchondroma change.
