An excision biopsy with curettage of the lesion and grafting was done with prophylactic stabilization.
This case illustrates many of the typical plain radiographic findings seen in Ollier's disease.

A-P and lateral radiographs of the left humerus shows a 4.0 cm x 2.5 cm expansile area of striation and osteolysis with a chondroid matrix and endosteal scalloping involving the lateral aspect of the proximal one third of the left humerus; with a pathologic fracture involving the humeral head.
There is subcentimeter lytic area with a thin sclerotic margin distal to the previously described lesion involving the diaphysis of the middle third of the left humerus.


A lytic region with endosteal scalloping involving the diaphysis of the distal one third of the left radius.

Multiple subcentimeter lytic areas with sclerotic borders involving the 2nd proximal and middle phalanx with a pathologic fracture at the base of the proximal phalanx.

Multiple well defined osteolytic lesions located in the medullary region of the humerus, radius and proximal and middle phalanx of the left extremity are highly suggestive of Ollier's disease.
Ollier's Disease
Characteristic of Ollier's disease
6 year old caucasian girl presents with shoulder pain.
An enchondroma is a slow growing, benign, intramedullary cartilaginous neoplasm that is ordinarily located in the bones of the hands and feet but can occur in any bone formed from cartilage. It is thought to be derived from a cartilaginous rest which expands to form a nest or streak of disorganized cartilage. In the United States, enchondromas account for 12 to 14% of benign bone tumors and 3 to 10% of osseous neoplasms in general. 
Men and women are equally affected with a peak incidence occurring in the third decade of life. 

Approximately 40 to 60% of all enchondromas will occur in either the hand or foot. Enchondromas are the most common benign lesion involving the phalanges, with the proximal phalanx and the distal metacarpal bones as the most popular sites of location. Approximately 20% of enchondromas in long bones such as the femur, tibia and humerus; other documented sites of formation include the ribs, sternum, and skull. 

Most are incidentally discovered on asymptomatic patients during a physical exam. 

Radiographically, enchondromas frequently present as well-defined lytic, long and oval lesions. In larger lesions, the lucent defect has endosteal scalloping with expansion of the cortex. There is usually no cortical breakthrough unless the bone is fractured. In the hands, enchondromas do not regularly contain calcifications although at other sites punctate and ring -shaped calcifications are characteristic. 
Radiographically, enchondromas that occur in the long tubular bones present as centrally or eccentrically placed medullary lytic lesions of variable size with or without the above-described calcifications with a lobulated endosteal margin of the cortex. 

Pain can be a sign of pathologic fracture or malignant transformation. In the absence of a fracture, a painful enchondroma is considered malignant until proven otherwise. A small percentage of enchondromas can become malignant. This is usually a delayed process and is more common in the long bones. Patients with painful or worrisome lesions should be evaluated by oncologic orthopedic surgeon and should undergo biopsy. Large defects can be treated with curettage and filled with bone graft. All specimens must be analyzed carefully for malignancy. Presence of malignancy changes the surgical procedure as a wide margin and complete resection are necessary. 
The term multiple enchondromatosis or dyschondroplasia is used when enchondromas occur in multiple bones. Ollier’s disease is a rare, non-heritable disorder characterized by multiple enchondromas in the metaphyses and diaphyses of long bones, primarily affecting one side of the body and localized to one extremity. 

The radiographic appearance of the enchondromas of Ollier's disease may appear different than those of a classic enchondroma; with a striated lucency and a chondroid calcifed matrix. A pronounced expansion of the cortex is common and is not a sign of malignant transformation. HoweverFive to 30%patients with Ollier's disease develop malignant transformation, particularly chondrosarcoma, although less commonly dedifferentiated chondrosacoam, osteosarcoma or chondroid chordoma. particularly in the central lesions. The presence of multiple enchondromas associated with soft tissue hemangiomas is known as Maffucci’s syndrome. 

This case illustrates the typical plain film findings seen in Ollier’s disease.
