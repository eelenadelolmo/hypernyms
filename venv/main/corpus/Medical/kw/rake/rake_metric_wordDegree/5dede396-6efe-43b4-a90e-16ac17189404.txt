Physical exam revealed a thin-appearing woman with a firm abdominal mass palpated below the costal margin extending from the left mid-clavicular line to the right anterior axillary line.
Surgical consultation is indicated for removal. The method for removal is dependent on the experience and comfort level of the surgeon or gastroenterologist. Many techniques have been described in the literature. Open or laparoscopic gastrotomy with removal of bezoar is the most common method. EGD with resection of bezoar and even cola therapy have been described. 

In this patient, Transesophageal resection via EGD was attempted but the procedure was aborted due to the size and consistency of the mass. Surgical gastrotomy with resection of the bezoar was successfully performed. NG tube placed post-op with advancement of diet. The patient was discharged on HD5 with follow-up with general surgery and psychiatry.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed. Evaluation of the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and right kidney was normal. Ultrasound of the area of palpable abnormality inferior to the liver revealed an echogenic image with curvilinear dense hyperechogenic surface and dense posterior shadowing.

A CT of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast reveals a markedly enlarged stomach distended by a round intraluminal mass of hypointense heterogeneous material. Retained air is visualized in the interstices. A thin rim of hyperintense material is seen lining the stomach wall representing displaced oral contrast.

A 28 year old woman presented with chronic right upper quadrant and epigastric abdominal pain, decreased appetite, and a palpable epigastric mass for five months.
Trichobezoar is an undigested intraluminal accumulation of ingested hair forming a mass. This condition is well-described, particularly in the pediatric population.  Trichobezoar was first described by Baudamant in the 18th century.  Since then, over 300 cases have been reported. There is a marked predominance in female pediatric patients with a history of hair chewing. It is unusual for a 28 year-old to present with thrichobezoar for the first time. Much less common is the Rapunzel syndrome; which is a trichobezoar extending to or through the ileocecal valve. There were only 6 ever reported cases of Rapunzel syndrome in 1998.

	The initial clinical manifestations of trichobezoar simulate those of an abdominal mass. A firm palpable epigastric mass is present in 87 % of cases; 70 % have pain and tenderness. Nausea and vomiting is present in 65 % and weakness and weight-loss in 38 %. 

        Complications include Gastric ulceration in 10 % of cases, 30 % of which resulting in perforation. Peritonitis has been reported as well as bowel obstruction.

Typical radiographic evaluation and appearance:

-	Frontal radiograph of the abdomen: An intraluminal mottled mass similar in appearance to a food-filled stomach.  A mottled gas pattern may be seen.

-	Ultrasound: Echogenic image with hyperechoic arclike surface casting clear posterior acoustic shadow.

-	CT of the abdomen with oral and IV contrast: Intraluminal oval mass with air retained in interstices. Also described as a hypodense intraluminal mass with meshlike pattern.  Contrast is seen sparsely through the mesh and more prominent at the periphery of the lesion.  The density, shape, and lack of a visible stalk rule out gastric tumor. 

-	Upper GI series: A mobile irregular, coherent intraluminal mass is seen. The mass is best visualized on delayed films after most of the barium has left the stomach or following the introduction of air into the stomach to produce a double contrast effect.
