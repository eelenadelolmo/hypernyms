N/A
Undergoing workup by orthopedics.
CR:  Mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion in the right humeral epiphysis with extension into the metaphysic without periosteal reaction.

MR:  Well circumscribed 2.3x2.8x2.4 centimeter heterogeneous signal lesion on T1 and T2 weighted sequences without associated soft tissue mass or extension beyond cortical margin.   No marrow edema.  Post gadolinium images demonstrate moderate enhancement.
Most likely clear cell chondrosarcoma given its enhancement characteristics.
Clear cell chondrosarcoma
Chondroblastoma
Osteosarcoma
Enchondroma
23 year old white male with right shoulder pain.
Given the enhancement pattern, this is likely a non-aggressive malignancy such as a clear cell chondrosarcoma.  This is less likely a osteosarcoma given its chondroid matrix on plain radiographs.  Also given its enhancement, less likely an enchondroma.
