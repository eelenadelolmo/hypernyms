Physical exam information is not available.
The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture.
Anterior-posterior radiograph of the pelvis, and frog-leg radiograph of the right hip show diffusely diminished bone density of the pelvis and right hip. No periosteal reaction or fracture is seen.

Coronal T1-weighted MR image of the pelvis demonstrates  linear low-signal-intensity area extending from the medial cortex of the right femoral neck into the medullary canal and is consistent with fracture. On the T2-weighted fat-saturated coronal MR image,  more extensive area of high-signal-intensity is present consistent with a combination of the fracture and post-traumatic edema and inflammation.

A 76-year-old woman presents to her primary care manager with right hip pain. No known history of trauma.
Hip fractures are very common, and, in the United States, =occur in more than 300,000 people annually. The incidence of hip fractures is rising in parallel with the rising age of our population, leading to increased disability and medical cost. Advancing age is the greatest risk factor for hip fractures; other risk factors include being Caucasian and female, having a maternal history of hip fracture, having decreased bone density, visual impairment or dementia, a sedentary lifestyle, smoking, a history of glucocorticoid, benzodiazepine or anticonvulsant use, or a history of hyperthyroidism. 

Hip fractures often have a significant impact on the life of the person affected. Between 15-20% of elderly patients with a hip fracture die within one year of the injury. Half of the patients with a hip fractures who had previously lived independently are unable to do so following the fracture. In addition to the significant mortality, patients with hip fractures and their surgical correction are at risk for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, pressure sores, delirium, and global deterioration of functionality. 

Patients with hip fractures often have a history of a fall followed by pain in the hip, groin, buttocks or back. They may have difficulty walking or bearing weight after the fall. On physical exam, there may be shortening and external rotation of the affected lower extremity. A history of trauma is not necessary, however, and patients with risk factors who present with hip pain or difficulty bearing weight should be evaluated thoroughly for an occult hip fracture and for osteoporosis that is often found in the elderly age group.

To evaluate for possible femoral fractures, radiographs should be done first. However, in patients with negative radiographs but a high clinical suspicion for fracture, MR imaging is the best imaging test to diagnose a fracture missed on plain radiographs. Early diagnosis is important in order that the hip fractures can be surgically corrected, preferably within 2-3 days of injury in order to reduce hospitalization and morbidity. 

Ingari et al showed that low-signal-intensity on T1-weighted MR images were correlative with non-displaced fractures induced in cadavers. In contrast, the high-signal-intensity that is seen on the T2-weighted MR image may represent the fracture and secondary post-traumatic edema and inflammation and may appear more extensive than the actual fracture. MR should therefore be acquired without delay if plain radiographs are negative but clinical suspicion remains high.

If MR imaging is not available, bone scans of the hip can be useful for identifying proximal femoral fractures. However, bone scans demonstrate fracture because of the increased metabolic activity surrounding the injury; in the elderly, the bone scans may not be positive until 3 days after injury. This delay can have a negative impact on the patient’s ultimate recovery. Therefore if MR imaging is available, it is the imaging test of choice in the patient with suspected hip fracture but with negative radiographs.

Hip fractures in the elderly have a significant rate of morbidity and mortality. Fractures of the femoral neck can lead to avascular necrosis of the femoral head due to disrupted blood supply from the lateral circumflex femoral artery. Fractures can also lead to malunion or nonunion between fragments as well as degenerative changes in the hip joint. Also, as mentioned previously, people who suffer a hip fracture are at significant risk for developing deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, pressure sores, delirium, infections, and decreased conditioning and functionality. Extended periods of hospitalization and limited mobility combine to create a major obstacle to the elderly person who may never be able to recover fully.

Preventive measures are important in preventing hip fractures in the elderly. The USPSTF recommends routine bone mineral density screening for women after age 65 years, and after age 60 years in high risk women. Treatment of those with decreased bone density with bisphosphonates has been shown to reduce fracture risk. High-dose oral vitamin D supplementation has also been shown to reduce the risk of fractures. Modifiable lifestyle factors include smoking cessation and weight-bearing exercise. 

In patients with hip fractures, early diagnosis and surgical fixation have been shown to reduce hospitalization and adverse events. Aggressive physical therapy is also very important in returning a patient to a functional level as close to baseline as possible. Plain radiographs are the first diagnostic imaging study for evaluating for hip fracture. However, if these are negative but clinical suspicion remains high for a fracture, MR imaging should be done for definitive diagnosis.
