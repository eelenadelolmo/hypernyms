The patient subsequently underwent hysteroscopy and the polyp was removed.
Sagittal and transverse endovaginal sonographic images of the uterus demonstrate fluid within the endometrial cavity deliniating an oval homogeneous mass (1 cm in greatest dimension) isoechoic to the myometrium arising from the endometrial wall and projecting into the endometrial cavity.  No significant color doppler flow is demonstrated within the mass.  The examination was otherwise normal.
