This patient received Lovenox with significant improvement.
MRI w/ Contrast of liver shows peripheral lack of enhancement with increased central enhancement, enlargement of the caudate lobe, and decreased signal in the hepatic vein consistent with thrombosis.

Doppler ultrasound of the right upper quadrant: Intrahepatic portion of the inferior vena cava, as well as the hepatic veins, are diminutive. There is also pulsatile hepatopetal flow in the portal vein, and ascites surrounding the liver.
Budd-Chiari Syndrome
1. Primary sclerosing cholangitis.
2. Hepatic cirrhosis.
Ascites of uncertain etiology.
This case highlights Budd-Chiari syndrome as a cause of postpartum ascites.
