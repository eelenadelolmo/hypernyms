CA 125-  410 U/mL
Single echogenic mass in the liver seen on ultrasound.
CT with contrast revealed multiple capsular masses over the dome of the liver .  Ascites and peritoneal studding as well as complex adnexal masses were seen.
Metastatic Ovarian adenocarcinoma verified by ex-LAP/pathology.
<li> Peritoneal carcinomatosis- Primaries from GU (Ovarian, cervical, endometrial), GI (gastric, pancreatic).

<li> Disseminated peritoneal tuberculosis or other fungal infections (Coccidiodes, Histoplasma).

<li> Peritoneal mesothelioma
Patient with abdominal distension and ovarian masses.
There were large masses that were not seen when evaluating the liver with ultrasound (may have been due to their location, that were obvious and easily seen with CT.  A single small metastasis in these locations could have been missed if using ultrasound alone to screen for metastatic disease.
