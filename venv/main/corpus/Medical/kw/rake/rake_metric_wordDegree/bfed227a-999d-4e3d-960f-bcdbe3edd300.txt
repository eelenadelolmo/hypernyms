Follow-up CT chest in one year to ensure stability or improvement.
CT Remarkable for:

Mediastinum: Noncalcified mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. No cardiac enlargement. No pericardial effusion. 

Lungs: In the right upper lobe there is a patchy and confluent ground-glass density 4.6 x 3.3cm (image 27) and peribronchovascular interstitial thickening that can be traced from this density to the hila (see image 32). In both upper and right middle lobes there are areas of ground glass opacity with a peribronchial vascular distribution.

Chest radiograph remarkable for prominent bilateral hila.

46 year old female presents for follow up CT. Relatively asymptomatic.
Discussion:

        The patient came to us with a well established diagnosis of sarcoidosis since 1998 (8 years).  The patient was followed with chest radiographs until she presented 2 years ago with a CT order for “several abnormal CTs” from an outside institution. CT with contrast at that time was consistent with stage II sarcoidosis with enlarged mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes and areas of parenchymal abnormality with the additional finding suggestive of a superimposed infectious process such as non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection. 2 years ago, in the patient's CT scan, it was noted in the impression that bronchoalveolar carcinoma or foci of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia was part of the differential because of an increase in diameter of a nodule from 5mm to 10mm. Since that time the patient has been followed clinically and with CT.  This CT demonstrated no enlargement.
        The usual indications for lung CT scans are for 1) atypical clinical and/or chest radiographic findings, 2) detection of complications of the lung disease, such as bronchiectasis, aspergilloma, pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, or a superimposed infection or malignancy, 3) a normal chest radiograph but a clinical suspicion for sarcoidosis (5). HRCT is not recommended to be performed on all patients with Sarcoidosis, but it may be helpful for the above reasons and for selected patients with stage II or III disease to discriminate active inflammation from irreversible fibrosis (5). 
        Although, Langerhans cell histiocytosis shares some CT features with sarcodosis; bronchial distortion, displaced fissures, and perihilar predominance are absent in LCH (5).  
        With hypersensitivity pneumonia, the features of centrilobular nodules, a mosaic pattern of attenuation (air trapping), and peribronchial (often confluent) ground glass opacities are more common and prominent in acute or subacute HP compared to Sarcoidosis. Subacute and acute phase HP preferentially distributes in the lower lobes (5). It is suggested to use CT to look for concomittent symmetric hilar and medastinal lymph node enlargement or the presence of reticular nodular opacities elsewhere for diagnostic clues (1).  
        Both sarcoidosis and lymphangitic carcinomatosis cause a beaded appearance along the bronchovascular bundles. Lymphangitic carcinomatosis causes a more marked septal thickening with thickened polygonal lines, the hallmark of this disease. Furthermore, with sarcoidosis, the nodules typically have irregular margins as those in lymphangitic carcinomatosis have smooth margins (5). Silicosis can be mimicked by sarcoidosis with the formation of conglomerate masses of fibrosis in the upper perihilar regions (1).



Sarcoidosis
		
Definition/Background: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease characterized histologically by noncaseating granulomas (1). 
	
Epidemiology: Sarcoidosis is more common in blacks than whites and it is rare in Asians (1). Sarcoidosis shows a predilection for women with most patients being 20-40 years old at the time of diagnosis (1,2). In the United States, the estimated lifetime incidence of sarcoidosis in African Americans is 2.4% versus 0.85% in whites (2). 

Etiology: Etiology is unknown (2).
	
Pathogenesis: Activation of pulmonary macrophages that recruit mononuclear cells leading to the formation of granulomas (1). The granulomas are a discrete tight collection of noncaseating epitheliod cells. The early sarcoidosis reaction is characterized by accumulation of CD45RO+, T lymphocytes, and macrophages. An unknown stimulus causing persistent inflammation and accumulation of chemoattractant cytokines to an inflamed area are proposed granuloma formation mechanisms (2). Dense bands of fibroblasts, mast cells, collagen, and proteoglycans may encase the granuloma and lead to fibrosis and irreversible destruction of affected organs (5). 
	
Clinical Presentation: Lofgren’s syndrome presents in 20%-50% of all cases of acute disease. Lofgren’s syndrome presents as pulmonary hilar lymphadenopathy, polyarthralgias, and erythema nodosum. 50% of patients receive the diagnosis of sarcoidosis after presenting for chronic cough, dyspnea or chest pain. Delay in diagnosis is often due to the non-specific mild nature of early symptoms, misdiagnosis, and economic barriers to medical care. African Americans are more likely to have extrathoracic involvement of the bone marrow, skin, liver, and eyes (uveitis) compared to whites. Whites are more likely to have hypercalcemia (2).  Other laboratory findings include hypergammaglobulinemia, elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme and cutaneous anergy to PPD skin test (1). 

Findings: 90% of patients with sarcoidosis show abnormalities on chest radiographs. Enlargement of the mediastinal and hilar .......(continued) see disease topic 7308
