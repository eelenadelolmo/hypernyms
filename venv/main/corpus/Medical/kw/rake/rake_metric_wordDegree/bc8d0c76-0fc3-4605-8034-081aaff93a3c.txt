He was lethargic on presentation, but without evidence of any focal neurological deficits.  Physical examination in the trauma bay showed swelling over his left temporal region and scattered facial abrasions.
Drainage via craniostomy has become the treatment of choice for acute subdural hematoma, but craniotomy may be required in certain cases.
Figure 1: Axial CT without contrast

The noncontrast head CT revealed a small hyperdense subdural hematoma, consistent with the acute injury (Fig. 1a).  There is pneumocephalus, seen as small bubbles of air within the left extraaxial parietal subdural collection as well as a single focus of air posteriorly at the left paramidline aspect of the extraaxial  space shown (Fig. 1a).  

These findings indicate that a fracture has occurred, allowing communication of outside air or a sinus cavity with the intracranial space.  Indeed a complex adjacent temporal bone fracture was detected and is best appreciated using bone windows (Fig. 1b).

An 18-year-old Hispanic man was brought by ambulance to the Emergency Department following a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which the patient was ejected from his vehicle.
