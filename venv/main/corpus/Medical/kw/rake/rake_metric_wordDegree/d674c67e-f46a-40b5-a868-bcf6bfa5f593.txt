Curvilinear hyperechoic lesion along dorsal aspect of corpora cavernosa which demonstrates posterior acoustic shadowing
Peyronie disease
Peyronie plaque
37 y/o WM complains of palpable mass on dorsum of penis
The main objective of imaging studies in a patient with PD is to identify calcification of the plaque because this end point usually signifies maturity of the plaque, and, when it is present, further angulation should not occur. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways.

1. A simple x-ray film of the penis can often help identify calcification within the plaque.

2. Alternatively, penile ultrasound can be used to help delineate the plaque and to place the calcification within it by the characteristic echogenic shadowing.

3. Corpus cavernosography can be used to help delineate the plaque and any compression of the cavernosal space. This test is usually not necessary because the findings typically do not alter the course of treatment.

4. MRI of the penis has recently been used to image the plaque while it is still composed of fibrous tissue. Although this is not the preferred imaging technique because of cost and availability, it may prove helpful in questionable cases.

5. Recently, investigators have used imaging studies to attempt to distinguish unstable, evolving PD from stable PD. Erdogru et al used penile scintigraphy with technetium Tc 99m human immunoglobulin G in a prospective study. These authors found 99mTc human immunoglobulin G at the plaque site in 10 of 11 patients with unstable plaques, compared with only 2 of 14 patients with stable plaques and 0 of 7 control patients. Although this technique requires some refinement and the data must be confirmed, it nevertheless presents a measurable parameter to help distinguish unstable PD, which is best treated medically, from stable PD, which may require surgical intervention.
