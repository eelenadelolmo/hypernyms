Increasing post operative pain.
Unknown
Axial T2 MR images at the level of surgery demonstrates an epidural fluid collection containing a fluid/fluid level consistent with an epidural hematoma.
Failed back syndrome, post operative hematoma in the lumbar spine.
Epidural hematoma
Recurrent/persistent HNP at operated site.
Scar
48 year old female 2 days post op from lumbar spinal fusion with increasing pain.  No neurologic abnormalities.
This case nicely demonstrates the fluid/fluid level seen in post operative hematoma/seroma.  Unfortunately, the T1 images were not available (for technical reasons) to confirm the presence of blood products.  However, in the immediate postoperative state with a fluid/fluid level at the level of surgery, an epidural hematoma is the most likely diagnosis.
