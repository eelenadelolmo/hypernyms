Contrast enhanced CT images demonstrate classic peripheral nodular enhancement with progressive central filling.

MR images demonstrate typical characteristics of progressive brightening on TE lengthening sequences, as well as peripheral nodular enhancement with central filling.

Both CT and MR images demonstrate a large central region without enhancement, consistent with cavernous hemangioma.

Early angiographic images demonstrate multiple peripheral regions of contrast pooling in a distribution consistent with the lesion visualized on CT and MRI.  Subsequent angiographic images demonstrate infusion of Ethiodol for embolization, followed by post embolization images demonstrating absence of peripheral pooling.
Hepatic Hemangioma
41 year old male with sudden onset of right upper quadrant pain.
This giant cavernous hemangioma measured approximately 15cm in greatest dimension.  Original plan was to resect the lesion surgically, but upon direct visualization of the lesion in the operating room, resection was felt to be too difficult.  The patient was subsequently referred to interventional radiology for embolization.  Embolization was performed with 30cc of Ethiodol followed by 10cc of a gel-foam slurry.  Post embolization angiographic images demonstrated excellent results.
