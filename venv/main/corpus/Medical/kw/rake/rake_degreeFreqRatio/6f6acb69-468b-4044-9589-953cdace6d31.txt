Texto: 
Tenderness over the left acromioclavicular joint.
Shoulder rest to allow healing.
Internal and external rotation radiographs of the left shoulder demonstrate widening of the acromioclavicular joint space with resorption of the distal end of the clavicle. The acromion side of the A/C joint is normal.
Osteolysis of Distal Clavicle.
Acro-osteolysis
(The following differential considerations typically involve both sides of the joint)
Hyperparathyroidism
Septic joint
Rheumatoid arthritis
27 year old Rugby player with continued pain over the left shoulder. He does not remember any specific trauma, but plays Rugby regularly and repeatedly uses his shoulder to hit others.
