Right knee findings:

Minimal warmth noted. 
No erythema.
No subcutaneous nodules. 
Minimally tender to palpation along joint line. 
Full range with both active and passive motion.  
Negative anterior/posterior drawer sign.
The issue of ongoing urate deposition should be addressed with uricosuric medication.  Probenecid (Benemid) is the most frequently used medication.  Probenecid works at the level of the proximal tubule by blocking reabsorption of filtered uric acid. This action is inhibited by low-dose salicylates; this fact accounts for a significant number of "treatment failures." Allopurinol (Zyloprim) can also be used and is currently the only readily available inhibitor of uric acid synthesis.

Tophi should not be surgically removed unless they are in a critical location or drain chronically.
There is no evidence of bone marrow abnormality.  A small joint
effusion is present.  A large nodular mass is seen adjacent to the lateral superior patella with isointense signal on T1 and heterogeneous signal on T2 measuring approximately 5.2 x 1.8 x 6 cm. Smaller similar masses are present at the femoropopliteal insertion site, within the femoral notch and at the base of the Hoffa's fat pad just anterior to the anteromedial tibia.
 
The PCL appears thickened but intact.  The ACL, menisci, and collateral
ligament complexes are unremarkable.  Full thickness fissuring is present in the medial trochlea cartilage.
Tophaceous gout
>> Gout
>> Pigmented villonodular synovitis
>> Pseudogout
>> Tumor
>> Uric acid nephropathy
>> Rheumatoid arthritis
>> Sarcoidosis
>> Amyloidosis
40 year old male with history of gout presents with chronic knee pain for 5 months.
MRI is not used routinely in the evaluation of gout. However, when gouty tophi present as soft-tissue masses in the absence of articular disease, the tophi may be confused with a neoplastic process. In this instance, MRI evaluation is necessary. Tophaceous deposition should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a mass displays heterogeneous low to intermediate signal intensity on T1 and T2 weighting and a variable enhancement pattern, especially if multiple foci exist around the knee joint such as in this individual. Remarkably, the adjacent bone to these particular tophi did not show typical erosive changes, which is an unexpected finding in a patient with a chronic history of gout and knee pain. As such, needle biopsy was necessary to rule out a neoplastic and chronic infectious etiology.
