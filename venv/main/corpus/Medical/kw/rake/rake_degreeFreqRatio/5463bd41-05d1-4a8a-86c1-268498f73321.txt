Texto: 
Upon observation of the knee there was obvious genu varum of the left leg when compared to the right leg. No bruising was present at this time. 

Valgus/varus stress testing revealed pain with valgus stress on the inside of the left knee. Deep palpation along the left femorotibial joint line medially was tender.  Positive left patellar grind, pain reported centrally in the knee. McMurray's was positive bilaterally. Pain is reported on the medial side of the left knee. Lachmans and AP Drawer were unremarkable bilaterally. Bechterewâ€™s procedure when performed on the left side produced lower back pain radiating down the left lower extremity to the knee.  Bechterewâ€™s procedure on the right side produced lower back pain.  

Extensor and flexor hallicus longus 5/5 bilaterally. 
Achilles reflex 1+ bilaterally. Subpatellar reflex 1+ bilaterally.

He was unable to toe walk, heel walk or squat. He could arise onto his heels and toes, but had difficult with balance.
 
Q angle on right side- 12 degrees as compared to 1-2 degrees on left side.
Since the accident the patient has been receiving diathermy treatment on his left knee to help increase vascularity to the patella and articular cartilage.  The patient has been riding a stationary bike. This continuous movement of the patella without a load will stimulate cartilage build up in his knees.  The patient has seen a significant amount of improvement with reduction of the pain in his knee. He now rates the pain as a 3-4 out of 10.
â€¢ Mild increase in signal in the distal quadriceps tendon without evidence of tear.

â€¢ Increased signal throughout the lateral meniscus, consistent with an extensive grade II signal. No definitive tear identified; no extension to fibular surface is noted. 

â€¢ Areas of advanced cartilage loss involving the lateral facet of the patella and lateral femoral trochlea. 

â€¢Subchondral edema within the lateral facet of the patella.
 
â€¢Anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and medial and lateral collateral ligaments are intact

46 year old man, with history of a stroke in 5 yrs ago and hypertension, who presents with left knee pain after being involved in a motor vehicle accident. He reports that his left knee struck the steering wheel/column after he was struck from behind at a stop light. The patient describes the pain as an "achy discomfort," and rates it a 6/10 on the pain scale. He says it is worse after prolonged sitting and climbing stairs. He denies any previous trauma to his knee. Patient reports that there was bruising of the left knee after the motor vehicle accident. The patient reports a loss of consciousness, which he regained while he was still in the vehicle. The patient was wearing his seat belt at the time of the motor vehicle accident. He reports that he took most of the impact through his shoulders and hands which were gripping the steering wheel. He also reports neck, back and shoulder pain.

This patient has chondromalacia patella in the presence of grade II signal within the lateral meniscus. The chondromalacia patella is stage IV as seen on MRI with complete loss of articular cartilage on the lateral facet of the patella and subchondral degeneration. The patients symptoms of dull aching over the patella and increased pain after prolonged time in the seated position/cinema sign and going up and down stairs are consistent with chondromalacia patella. 

This patient most likely developed CMP due to malalignment of the knee joint adding extra pressure on the patella and altering the natural balance of forces that act on the patella. This was supported by the decrease in the Q angle in the left leg and the presence of genu varum of the left leg. 

It should be noted that the presence of increased signal within the lateral meniscus with no definite tear being identified may have predisposed the patient to the development of CMP.  It has been show in studies that unrepaired mensici after injury increases the likelihood of developing CMP. An injured meniscus will redistribute the amount of pressure put on the patella increasing likelihood of cartilage breakdown secondary to increased pressure and abnormal tracking of the patella. 

Another factor that could have been involved in the patient's development of CMP is his history of a stroke in 2006 that led to left sided weakness. This weakness could have weakened the quadraceps muscle and muscles supporting the left hip. Muscle weakness of the quadriceps and hip have been shown to add increased pressure on the patella and knee. 

Diathermy and bike riding have been utilized in treating the patient. Diathermy is used to increase the vascular flow around the patella to help increase blood flow to articular cartilage. Bike riding is utilized as a zero load manuver that providing repetitive tracking of the patella stimulating growth of the articular cartilage. The patient has noticed significant improvement with these techniques. 

The patient has continued to see specialist about his knee, mainly focusing on the possibility of a lateral meniscal tear. The patient may consider surgical intervention addressing his mensical injury, which may help allieviate  his symptoms due to CMP. 

Clinical diagnosis via patient history and physical exam findings: Dull aching pain in the central portion of left knee that worsens upon prolonged sitting and climbing stairs. Decreased Q angle, positive patellar grind, and positive McMurray's. Tenderness on palpation of femorotibial joint line. Genu varum of left leg. This was confirmed by MRI which showed advanced patellofemoral arthritis consistent with Grade IV chondromalacia patella/patellar arthrosis.
