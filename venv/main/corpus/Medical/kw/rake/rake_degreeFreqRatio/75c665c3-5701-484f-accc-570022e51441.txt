For large diverticuli, surgical correction may be warranted if the patientâ€™s symptoms suggest or if there is malignant degeneration
On barium swallow exams, there is pooling of contrast within a diverticulum above the cricopharyngeous muscle originating in the midline of the posterior wall of the hypopharynx.  This is best appreciated on the lateral view.
Zenker's diverticulum
Zenkerâ€™s diverticulum
Killian Jamieson diverticulum
Pseudo-Zenkerâ€™s diverticulum
35 year old male with occasional feeling of lump in throat, mainly after eating.
Because this diverticulum is midline, a Killian-Jamieson diverticulum is ruled out.  Also, because this lesion persists throughout the swallow study and does not disappear after the bolus of swallowed food passes into the stomach, a pseudo-Zenkerâ€™s diverticulum is excluded.
