As reported in the HPI, patient has had back pain since 2012, treated with surgery (anterior discectomy and fusion of C3, C4, and C5). She was also treated with physical therapy and other conservative measures. After being involved in MVA on 7/01/2016, patient was treated with chiropractic manipulative therapy.  She has also received ultrasound therapy to the cervicothoracic region. Patient was also encouraged to gradually apply and increase quantum exercise to strengthen the lower back and core.  She has been taking cyclobenzaprine and naproxen for pain.  She will continue with physical therapy and follow up with the chiropractor.

Cervical Spinal Stenosis and Myelopathy with Lumbar Radiculopathy
1.	Upper motor neuron disease 
2.	Cervical radiculopathy 
3.	Spinal stenosis 
4.	Shoulder impingement syndrome 
5.	Lumbar radiculopathy
Patient is a 52-year-old African American Female who complains of neck and lower back pain. 
Neck pain is about 9/10 on pain scale and is associated with right upper extremity pain and tingling sensation extending into the third, fourth and fifth digits of right hand. Patient has previously complained of left shoulder pain and exhibited left arm weakness. She however denies pain in the left shoulder during this visit. 

Lower back pain is also rated at 9/10 and is associated with tingling and numbness in lower extremities bilaterally, and bowel/bladder incontinence. She also experiences incontinence when she coughs or sneezes. She reports that she can only lift very light weights and has difficulty bending or squatting. 

Patient has an extensive history of neck and lower back pain. She began having back pain in 2012 while working as a certified nursing assistant. In 2012, she fell and had to stop working. She then underwent anterior discectomy and fusion of C3, C4, and C5 via anterior approach. After the surgery, she began physical therapy until about 2015. She reports that after the therapy she could walk better and had no falls.

In 2016, patient was allegedly involved in motor vehicle accident (MVA). She was seated on the front-passenger seat with her seatbelt fastened. The car she was in was struck on the driver’s side by another vehicle. She heard her neck snap and became dizzy and faint. She denies loss of consciousness, or blood loss. She however began having persistent neck pain, headaches, tingling sensation in left upper extremity, lower back pain and pain in the lower extremities bilaterally. She also reports loss of urinary control following the MVA. She was told that she had sustained a whiplash and was started on physical therapy at a frequency of twice a week. She continues to go for physical therapy.
 
Review of systems
Patient reports morning headaches associated with photophobia, phono phobia, nausea and blurred vision. She also reports loss of appetite, dizziness, insomnia, and weight loss. She denies fevers, chills, or sweats.
 
Past Medical History
Patient reports high blood pressure and takes hydrochlorothiazide. She also takes Naproxen, cyclobenzaprine, and iron pill.
Mark Waweru MSIII, Frank Mascaro MD, Randall Loftus MD, Joanna Garvey DC, Robert Lutnick MD, Scott Croce DC, Gary Smith DC, Krishnan Kartha MD, Joseph Serghany MD, Greg Feld MD, Vaseem Iqbal MD, Jennifer Sperrazza DC, Jeffrey Lieberman MD, Geoffrey Gerow DC.  This is an interesting case of a patient with both upper motor neuron signs and cervical as well as lumbar radiculopathy. Symptoms suggestive of cervical radiculopathy include neck pain associated with right upper extremity pain and tingling sensation extending into third, fourth and fifth digits of right hand. Symptoms suggestive of lumbosacral radiculopathy include lower back pain associated with tingling and numbness in lower extremities bilaterally. Signs suggestive of upper motor neuron lesion include positive Hoffmann's and Tromner’s reflexes in the right third finger, brisk achilles reflex on the right lower extremity, sustained clonus and babinski sign in the right foot. Other signs (not exhibited by this patient) of upper motor neuron lesions include pronator drift, diminished or absent superficial reflexes, such as abdominal and cremasteric reflexes [1].

Given these findings of upper motor neuron lesion signs and radiculopathy symptoms, one would suspect that this patient would have multiple lesions in the brain and spinal cord, or entirely in the spinal cord. This is because neurological abnormalities resulting from upper motor neuron lesions occur contralaterally when the lesions are located superior to the spinomedullary junction, and ipsilaterally when the lesions are located caudal to spinomedullary junction [1]. 

Assuming that the location of upper motor lesion is in the brain and given that this patient is exhibiting upper motor neuron signs on the right side of her body, it is expected then that the lesion would be on the left side of her brain. A MRI brain image of the patient shows multiple foci of hyperintensity identified throughout the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres. The largest abnormality is left parietal measuring just over 1 cm in diameter. There is a linear appearing lesion within the right corpus callosum which suggests the possibility of demyelinating disease. This patient however lacks typical signs and symptoms of a demyelinating disease such as impaired vision, ataxia, and paralysis [1]. The lesion itself is also not a typical demyelinating lesion. It is therefore unlikely that there is an upper motor lesion in the brain.  

The other possibility is an upper motor neuron lesion in the right side of cervical spinal cord, given that this patient is exhibiting upper motor neuron signs on the right side of her body. Imaging of the cervical spine confirmed presence of anterior discectomy and fusion with instrumentation, impingement on the ventral cord and bilateral foraminal stenosis mostly at the level of C3-C6. Spinal myelopathy was also noted at C4-C5 disc space. It is therefore likely that the impingement on the ventral cord and spinal myelopathy observed at C4-C5 could be the cause of the upper motor neuron signs.
 
In addition, studies have shown that lesions occurring on the ventral aspect of the spinal cord at the cervical and thoracic levels result in abdominal muscle weakness. This is because about 20% of the upper motor neuron fibers, specifically corticospinal tract fibers, do not decussate at the spinomedullary junction to the contralateral side. Rather, these fibers descend in the ventral portion of the spinal cord and innervate the anterior and posterior abdominal muscles [5]. This patient however, has signs of upper motor neuron lesion primarily on the right side of her body and does not have abdominal muscle weakness.
  
The cervical radiculopathy symptoms were evaluated using electrodiagnostic testing and Imaging of the spine. Electrodiagnostic testing of the upper extremities was essentially normal. Imaging of the cervical spine confirmed presence of anterior discectomy and fusion with instrumentation, impingement on the ventral cord and bilateral foraminal stenosis mostly at the level of C3-C6. At the level of C6-C7 disc space, there is spondylosis and disc space narrowing with disc desiccation and broad-based bulge effacing the anterior subarachnoid space mildly with borderline central spinal stenosis. There is also hypertrophy of the uncovertebral joints asymmetric on the left and mild left foraminal stenosis. These findings could be the cause of the cervical radiculopathy.
 
Although the patient states that she could walk better and her symptoms improved after the neck surgery and physical therapy, it is not completely clear whether the upper motor neuron signs were present after or prior to the accident in 2016. However, the CT and MRI of the cervical spine show impingement on the ventral cord and spinal myelopathy at C4-C5 resulting from anterior discectomy and fusion with instrumentation. It is therefore possible that the upper motor neuron signs resulted from neck surgery in 2012 and only became apparent when she presented to the chiropractor’s office.
 
Additionally, this patient reportedly benefited from neck surgery and physical therapy. She reports that after the therapy she could walk better and had no falls. Studies comparing surgery and conservative treatment have shown that patients who undergo surgery report faster relief of symptom than patients treated conservatively, but overall improvement of symptoms in both groups is equivalent at one to two years [2]. This patient is currently being treated conservatively with physical therapy cyclobenzaprine, ibuprofen and chiropractic manipulative therapy. Studies have however shown that most patients with compressive radiculopathy improve with conservative treatment and about a third of the patients experience recurrence of symptoms after initial improvement [3]. It is therefore possible that she may continue having radiculopathy symptoms even while being treated with conservative measures. Moreover, this patient has factors which places her at risk for radiculopathy including female gender, obesity, degenerative changes seen on her MRI spine and history of heavy/frequent lifting as a certified nursing assistant. Other risk factors that contribute to radiculopathy are poor body posture and mechanics, pregnancy, family history of radiculopathy, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and scoliosis [4].
 
Electromyography findings of lower extremities confirmed active right and left L4-L5 radiculopathy. Imaging of the lumbar spine at L4-L5 disc space showed a broad bulge of the annulus with marked facet arthropathy. There is also bilateral foraminal stenosis with compression of the L4 nerve roots bilaterally that is greater on the right than left. At the level of L2-L3, L3-L4, and L5-S1, there is bulge of the annulus and bilateral foraminal stenosis. Although the image findings might have resulted from chronic degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, the presence of active right and left L4-L5 radiculopathy suggests that the accident in 2016 may have been the direct cause of her symptoms. 

The presentation of both upper motor neuron signs and radiculopathy is certainly interesting and raises question about whether a single lesion in the spinal cord can cause both upper motor neuron signsand radiculopathy symptoms, and what effect this would have on stretch reflexes. Would the stretch reflex be brisk, normal, decreased or absent? In order to answer these question, future studies should investigate the exact role of upper motor neuron fibers in the mechanism of hyperactive stretch reflexes.
