CT - Again, there are dilated loops of small bowel throughout the abdomen. There is also the small bowel feces sign present in which there is particulate fecal-like material within a loop of small bowel. This is sign is not sensitive but is associated with SBO and can be used to help locate the transition point which is usually adjacent.
