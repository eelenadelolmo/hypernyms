Diagnosis and treatment included the patient receiving coronary catherization which revealed occlusion of left circumflex and severe stenosis of proximal vein graft to right coronary artery. The RCA was predilated with a 2.5 x 12mm NC balloon and stented subsequently with a 3.5 x 18mm drug-eluting stent. A filling defect was also found more distal in the graft and 2 runs of aspiration thrombectomy were performed unsuccessfully and therefore he was stented with a 4 x 28 mm drug-eluting stent. Final angiographic images show TIMI-3 flow in RCA. 

On follow-up a Nuclear medicine myocardial stress test (two-day) was performed. On day one the patient was exercised according to standard treadmill protocol.  The patient attained maximum heart rate of 109 BPM, representing 66% of the maximum predicated heart rate.  At peak exercise the patient was injected with 25 mCi of technetium-99m sestamibi.  SPECT images were obtained in multiple planes and displayed in multiple planes. On day two, rest images of the left ventricle were obtained following the intravenous injection of 25 mCi of technetium-99m sestamibi.  SPECT images were obtained in multiple planes and displayed in multiple planes. A large fixed lateral wall defect extending into the anterior wall and more prominently into the inferior wall is noted.  No significant reversible ischemia is seen. Review of gated SPECT images show global hypokinesia.  There is low estimated left ventricular ejection fraction equals 36%. The transient ischemic dilatation index equals 1.20 of which normal is 1.22 and less. 

On follow-up a nuclear MUGA scan was also performed. In vivo blood pool labeling was performed utilizing sequential intravenous injection of cold pyrophosphate followed 30 minutes later by 25.0 mCi of technetium 99m pertechnetate.  Adequate in vivo blood pool labeling is achieved.  Multigated analysis was performed in the left anterior oblique projection. A markedly low left ventricular ejection fraction is calculated at 30 percent consistent with global hypokinesia. A dilated left ventricle is noted but no definite focal wall motion abnormality is demonstrated.

No spinal impingement at this level but there is a somewhat narrowing of the spinal canal. However there is no foraminal narrowing at this level.   Noted is mid to upper cervical pseudo-block vertebrae.

Figure 2. MRI C5-6
There is a mild disc bulge with effacement of the anterior CSF and mild central stenosis related to disc bulge with protrusion herniation and congenitally small spinal canal

Figure 3. MRI C6-7
There is a disc bulge present with effacement of the anterior CSF and spinal canal is somewhat narrowed. There is mild foraminal narrowing bilaterally.

The patient is a 55-year-old African-American male with a recent history of sudden onset chest pain. Patient states that he had been out the weekend before with his girlfriend for ‚ÄúJuneteenth‚Äù celebrations and felt that he was getting tired more easily, walking slowly, and did not have an appetite. He also reported that he had been under increased stress because of worry over the insurance cutting some of the medical services he received from a previous motor vehicle accident. That morning the patient started having retrosternal tightness and sharp chest pain starting at 7am which he rated as 6/10. He reported that pain was localized to the retrosternal area without radiation elsewhere. There was no associated nausea, shortness of breath and diaphoresis and patient reported that chest pain felt the same as the previous NSTEMI episode he had in 2008 that was treated with a 4-vessel CABG procedure. The patient noted that there was mild improvement of pain by leaning forward and worsened with walking. He had taken his usual medications that morning which did not relieve his pain.  He reported that he had left upper extremity pain that was the same type and character of pain that he had following a vehicular accident noted in the paragraph below.   The left upper extremity pain will be discussed later in this case in terms of differential diagnosis between acute coronary disease and cervical radiculopathy.  This case is linked to the associated [Topic] exploring the same. 

This patient also had a relatively recent motor vehicle collision (prior to the chest pain noted in the previous paragraph). He reports that he was a belted driver of a vehicle that was stopped and was struck from behind by another driver and felt a ‚Äúsnap‚Äù in his neck. He reported no loss in consciousness but had immediate neck pain and went to the General Hospital where he received CT scan and was released being only prescribed ibuprofen.  Afterwards,  the patient reported that it felt like a ‚Äútorch‚Äù on the back of his neck and into his shoulder as well as neck pain, middle back and lower back pain. He reported that after the accident he had 3-4 headache episodes a day with dizziness and blurry vision and denied nausea, photophobia, loss of bowel or bladder control. His sleep has also decreased from 8 hours to only 2-3 hours a night.  He  denies any fever, chills, loss of appetite, weight change, low energy, anxiety or night sweats. 

Past Medical History: 
This patient has a past medical history of coronary artery disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hepatitis C. He denies any previous work episodes, previous vehicular accidents or any other slips, falls or athletic episodes affecting his neck or back. He has a past surgical history of a 4 vessel coronary artery bypass graft, right hand surgery due to his rheumatoid arthritis and a bilateral hip replacement. He is currently taking Crestor, Plavix and medication for his rheumatoid arthritis as prescribed by his primary physician

Also known as ‚Äúpsuedoangina‚Äù cervical angina is a disease caused by either trauma or disease to the cervical spine which causes pinching of spinal nerves that innervate muscles in the chest. The pain evoked from the pinching of these nerves in these muscles is similar to angina pectoris pain. Cervical angina is a disease that  requires a high index of suspicion from the physician.  While in this patient coronary catherization definitively found a cardiac cause for his angina, he has many symptoms that were potentially suggestive of cervical angina. His continuing radiculopathy in the left arm along with disc bulges in C5-6 and C6-7 and ankyloses of cervical spinous processes from C7-through thoracic vertebrae all can lead to nerve root impingement. This can manifest as cervical angina as the medial anterior thoracic nerves originate from the 8th cervical and 1st thoracic and the lateral anterior thoracic nerve originates from the 6th and 7th cervical nerves and these innervate the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles. 

However, as with any cases of chest pain, cardiac causes must be ruled out first. Once, cardiac causes of chest pain are ruled out then considering this patient having several risk factors of rheumatoid arthritis, previous injury to cervical spine and continuing left-sided radiculopathy all strongly suggest cervical angina as a cause. This could be corroborated with cervical spine imaging showing cervical spondylosis and spinal cord impingement. Conservative treatment for cervical radiculopathy with associated cervical angina include: Chiropractic care, use of a hard collar, intermittent traction, isometric exercise, and combination of anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxant medication. If symptoms persist even with conservative treatment, then surgery such as discectomy or spinal fusion to relieve spinal impingement may be done.
