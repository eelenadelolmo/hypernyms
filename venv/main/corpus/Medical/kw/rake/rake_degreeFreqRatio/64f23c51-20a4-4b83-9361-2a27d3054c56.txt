Texto: 
Infant on assisted ventilation with abdominal distension which was rigid with perineal discoloration. Labs revealed sudden onset metabolic/respiratory acidosis with leukocytosis and blood culture grew E.coli.
Metabolic and respiratory acidosis corrected 
Penrose inserted and transferred to surgical unit.
Surgery delayed due to poor clinical condition and laparatomy performed 4 days later to find a small segment of necrotic small bowel.
KUB showed pneumoperitoneum which was not apparent on the AP but evident on the left decubitus film
Spontaneous Intestinal Perforation
â€¢ Necrotizing enterocolitis
â€¢ Spontaneous intestinal Perforation
â€¢ E.Coli sepsis
809g male infant product of 24 weeks uncomplicated pregnancy delivered by vaginal delivery was admitted to NICU for prematurity and respiratory distress. Enteral feeding started with trophic feeds on day 3 and developed abdominal distension on day 8 of life with increasing respiratory requirement
The clinical presentation correlates with NEC but there were no cardinal features such as pneumatosis on the abdominal film; therefore the possibility of SIP raised. The perforation was not apparent in the AP torso film but could be seen in the left decubitus film. The bowel pathology at the surgery also confirms a pathology localized to small area as opposed to global bowel necrosis in NEC.
