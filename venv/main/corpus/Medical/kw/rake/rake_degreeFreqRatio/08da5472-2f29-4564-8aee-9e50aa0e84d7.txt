24 HOUR RADIOACTIVE IODINE UPTAKE: 0.4%
See factoid.
Planar neck demonstrates a not well visualized thyroid gland which appears to be of normal contour.  There is diffusely decreased trapping throughout, thereby significantly confounding further assessment.
AMIODARONE THYROTOXICOSIS
1) Excess Iodine - Jod Basedow Effect
2) Factitious Thyrotoxicosis
3) Struma ovarii
