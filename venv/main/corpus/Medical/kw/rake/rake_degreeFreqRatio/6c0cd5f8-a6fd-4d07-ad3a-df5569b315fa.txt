Orthopedic referral for Hip Arthroscopy and possible repair.
Intra-articular Gadolinium was administered under fluoroscopy followed by MRI imaging.  Sagittal and Axial T1 and T1 fat saturated images show abnormal linear and irregular signal in the anterior superior labrum consistent with the labral tear.  Gadolinium is visualized within the joint space and accentuates visualization of the labral tear.
Labral tear of the acetabulum
Labral tear of the acetabulum.
Normal labrum.
Other sources for hip pain such as stress fracture, avascular necrosis, bursitis, or muscle strain.
The patient presented with persistent right hip pain despite conservative therapy and activity modifications.
