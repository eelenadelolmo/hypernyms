Neck pain and headache.
Neurosurgical anterior screw placement (see final pic).
No open-mouth view.  AP view unremarkable. Lateral C-spine radiograph demonstrated 20mm of soft tissue anterior to C-2. 

Axial CT 1.2mm collimination images through upper cervical spine demonstrates a Type III dens fracture extending transversely through the body.  Reformatted cornal view demonstrates the fracture well.

Post-operative axial CT 1.2 mm collimation through same region demonstrates anteriorly placed screw for fixation (reformatted in sagital view).
Type III Dens Fracture
Type II Dens fracture.
24 year male involved in a motor vehicle collision.
It is imperative to obtain an open-mouth view for complete evaluation of the cervical spine.  No fracture is seen on the lateral view – only a large amount (20mm) of prevertebral soft tissue swelling is seen, leading one to believe a fracture could have occurred.

The axial CT of the upper cervical spine is necessary whenever a fracture of the cervical spine is visualized on plain radiographs or when there is a question of a fracture and a need for further evaluation is required.

There are three classic fractures of the dens described by Anderson and D’Alonzo, I-III.  Type I is a fracture through the most superior aspect of the dens, superior to the transverse ligament, and is the least common.  Type II is a fracture through the junction of the dens and the body of C2.  It is the most common type.  Type III fractures involve the body of C2.  Some classify a Type IIA which is a Type II with a comminuted base.

Type I is usually managed conservatively.  Type II fractures have the highest rate of nonunion without surgical fixation.  Type III can be managed conservatively with immobilization in a halo vest for 12 weeks, usually affording a 90% union.  If the fracture is close to the neck, it may behave like a Type II, with a much higher chance for non-union.

Fixation can be either anterior or posterior.  In our patient’s case, an anterior approach was used.
