Texto: 
Radiographs ordered revealed a comminuted fracture of the distal fibula.  Fracture dislocation of the tibia on the talus with medial malleolar fracture and anterior distal tibial fracture minimaly displaced.
Surgical reduction of the fracture with the insertion of screws and a plate to ensure anatomic alignment.  A cast was placed over the fracture site for stabilization.
There is a complete oblique fracture of the left distal fibular shaft with displacement of the distal fragment and overlapping the proximal fragment.  The tibia presents with both a displaced medial malleolar fracture and a dislocation of the tibia off the talar dome.  There is also an anterior distal fracture that is displaced in the horizontal direction and soft tissue edema.
Lauge-Hansen Supination-Lateral Rotation fracture, Type 4.
Lauge-Hansen Supination-Lateral Rotation fracture, Stage 4.
Patient experienced a severe pain after stepping into a hole and twisting his left ankle.
The Lauge-Hansen classification provides a useful way to describe the radiographic findings in terms of the known mechanism of injury.  In this case the patient underwent a twisting motion around his ankle after he stepped in the hole, resulting in the complex fracture.  The Lague-Hansen classification can also give some insight into how much force was applied to the joint by the examiner noting the extent of injury on the radiographs and any physical findings.  Here, the force was sufficient to progress all the way to type 4, a transverse fracture of the medical malleolus.  The patient subsequently underwent surgical reduction, and post-reduction radiographs showed anatomic alignment.
