Patient was treated for the underlying condition, a COPD exacerbation and pneumonia. A chest tube drainage was used to drain the hydropneumothorax.
Frontal chest radiograph showing sharply delineate opacity of inferior left lung fields, with visible pleural margins in the left apex. 

The lateral view shows a visible air fluid level within the pleural space; a hydropneumothorax.  There is some secondary atelectasis of the left lower lobe. Fluid is seen within the major fissure an along the outline of the lingula.

Lateral decubitus radiograph shows shifting of the fluid against the lateral chest wall and visible left lobar and right apical lung margins.  This supports the finding of a hydropneumothorax.

Pneumothorax can be classified as primary, secondary, and tension pneumothorax. 

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is usually due to the rupture of apical subpleural blebs. Occurs at rest and mainly in smokers. The main physical finding of pneumothorax is decreased breath sounds despite increased or normal resonance on percussion. Initial treatment is simple aspiration. Small pneumothoraces can be treated with supplemental oxygen therapy and may reabsorb spontaneously.

Secondary causes of pneumothorax are primarily COPD, TB, trauma, P. carinii and other pneumonias, but incidents have been reported with just about every every lung disease. Treatment should include tube thoracostomy and installation of a sclerosing agent. Other treatment optoins depend on treating the underlying cause.

Tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency and occurs when air is progressively forced into the thorax and causing an immenent lung collapse. Common causes are mechanical ventilation and resuscitative efforts. A defect in the chest wall draws air into the thorax during inspiration but traps it during expiration. The characteristic signs are a large hemithorax, a contralateral shift of the mediastinum, and absence of breath sounds. A large bore needle should be inserted through the second intercostal space to decompress the pneumothorax. A thoracostomy tube should be inserted to maintain decompresson.
