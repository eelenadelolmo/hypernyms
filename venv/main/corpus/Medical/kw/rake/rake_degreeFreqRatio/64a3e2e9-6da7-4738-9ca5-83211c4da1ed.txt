Due to an interval increase in size of the mass from 4.5 x 4.1 cm to 5.3 x 4.2 cm, and the increased risk of hemorrage, treatment was indicated.  The patient underwent selective catheter based embolization, as embolization is an effective, minimally invasive treatment.  The technical success rate is near 100%, with a rare incidence of recurrence in sporadic AMLs.

Contrast enhanced axial CT images reveal a large enhancing mass involving the upper pole of the right kidney.  The mass has multiple foci of fat density.

Catheter angiogram demonstrates a single right renal artery, with a defect in the upper pole corresponding to the angiomyolipoma.  There is minimal blood supply to this lesion although it arises from a&#8232; single upper pole branch. The artery supplying this mass was subselected with a microcatheter and &#8232;then embolized to obtain arterial stasis using 300 to 500 micron&#8232; bead block.  

Post-embolization image shows absent flow to the mass.
