Multiple deformities with positive rheumatoid factor
Hands: There is loss of the radiocarpal joint space on the left with relative sparing on the right.  There are significant bony erosions of most of the metatarsophalangeal joints.  There are subluxations with joint space narrowing and erosions at the fourth pip on the right and the fifth on the left.  There is significant soft tissue swelling.  There is periarticular osteopenia.

Foot: There are severe subluxations/dislocations at all of the mtp joints bilaterally, with significant valgus deformities.  The PIP and DIP joints are relatively well preserved.  There is periarticular osteopenia.  There is soft tissue swelling.

Chronic hand pain
This was a good example of late stage RA in both the hands and the feet.  The findings of erosive arthropathy without productive changes predominating in carpal, MCP, and PIP joints, extensive subluxations, periarticular osteopenia and soft tissue swelling are classic for rheumatoid arthritis.
