Non contributory
Surgery and radiation therapy
â€¢ CT--high density mass lesion, right temporal and occipital lobes
â€¢ MRI--Hemorrhagic lesion, with irregular enhancement and associated vasogenic edema
Anaplastic oligodendroglioma
â€¢ Glioma
â€¢ Metastatic disease
â€¢ Ruptured AVM
59 year old woman, previously healthy, brought to outside ER unresponsive.  Outside CT scan was abnormal.
Brain hemorrhage was diagnosed on outside CT scan.  Oligodendroglioma, glioblastoma, and pituitary macroadenoma are well-known for spontaneous non-traumatic hemorrhage.
