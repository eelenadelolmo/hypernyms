careful monitoring
Linear lucencies extending  from the axilla into the distal forearm
Subcutaneous emphysema
necrotizing fasciitis
gangrene
penetrating extremity trauma
penetrating chest trauma
35 yo man s/p bilateral renal transplants, small pneumothorax formation and s/p right chest tube placement x 2
The forearm films and hand films were provided initially, with a call from a concerned intern about the possibility of necrotizing fasciitis in this afebrile, non-septic patient with a non-erythematous forearm.  Subsequent review of all the available images revealed the large pocket of subcutaneous air in the axilla, which had dissected into the forearm.
