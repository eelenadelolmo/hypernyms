Normal mammogram one year prior.
Annual mammogram.  Monthly self-breast exams.
Spontaneous appearance of pleomorphic calcifications within the left nipple.  No calcifications were present one year prior. No calcifications present within right breast.
Benign calcifications
• Benign calcifications (secretory)
• Intraductal papilloma
• Paget's Disease of Nipple
• Malignant/suspicious - Bx required
61 y.o. woman, clinically asymptomatic for routine screening mammogram.
Pleomorphic calcification should be biopsied.  In this case, they were benign.  The unique aspect of this case was that unilateral nipple calcification appeared within the course of one year.  No nipple calcifications were present on any prior mammograms. If bilateral calcifications were present, the more likely possibility would have been calcified secretory deposits, perhaps from sebaceous glands of the nipple.

From the mammographic appearance, an intraductal papilloma had to be excluded.  However, from a clinical standpoint, the patient had no evidence of nipple discharge, which is typically the first symptom of intraductal papilloma.

After excision, the pathology simply stated benign calcifications within normal nipple.
