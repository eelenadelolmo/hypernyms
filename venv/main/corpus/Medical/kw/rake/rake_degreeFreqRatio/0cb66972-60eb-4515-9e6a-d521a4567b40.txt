The patient is not know to be receiving any treatment at this time.  This follow-up CXR demonstrates progression from stage I to stage II disease.  This would be an indication for beginning treatment with corticosteroids.
The PA and LAT chest radiographs presented here continue to demonstrate significant paratracheal and bilateral perihilar lymph node enlargement as well as subcarinal adenopathy.  In addition, there is a diffuse reticulonodular pattern of parenchymal involvement, greater in the upper lung fields.  These findings are consistent with progression from stage I to stage II disease.

Infection (TB, histoplasmosis, coccidiodomycosis, blastomycosis)
Malignancy (lymphoma, metastatic dz)
32 yo black female who presented approximately a year ago with a one year history of red-brown maculopapular lesions involving the medial portion of her eyelids, bilaterally.  She was otherwise asymptomatic.  She received a frontal chest radiograph at that time which demonstrated a classic sarcoid 1,2,3 sign of right paratracheal and bilateral perihilar lymph node enlargement without parenchymal involvement.  For the past year, she has been followed by a pulmonologist and is not known to be receiving any treatment.  Her PFTs demonstrate a mild restrictive pattern.  The studies presented here are part of her routine follow-up.
Although sarcoidosis affects males and females of all ages and races, it is more prevalent in female adults younger than 40 years of age of African American ethnic background (lifetime risk of 2.4 percent for blacks versus 0.85 percent for whites), such as this patient.  Additionally, such as with this patient, approximately 50% of cases are found in patients who are asymptomatic at time of diagnosis.  As many as 20-25% of patients have dermatologic manifestations, which range from maculopapular lesions affecting the face (nares, lips, eyelids) to more characteristic lesions such as lupus pernio (red/purple, indurated plaques and nodules most commonly affecting the nose, cheeks, ears, and lips).  At presentation, this patient had evidence of stage I disease, which is defined by presence of hilar adenopathy only.  Patients with stage I disease require no treatment and can be followed-up with chest radiographs every six months.  55-90% of patients with stage I disease experience regression of the hilar adenopathy.  This patient now has evidence of stage II disease, characterized by hilar adenopathy plus interstitial infiltrates (typically more predominant in the upper lungs).  Oral corticosteroids used for 6-24 months, although not conclusively shown to improve long-term outcomes, are typically used in patients with stage II or III disease, with progression of symptoms or radiographic changes.  40-60% of patients with stage II disease will experience spontaneous remission.
