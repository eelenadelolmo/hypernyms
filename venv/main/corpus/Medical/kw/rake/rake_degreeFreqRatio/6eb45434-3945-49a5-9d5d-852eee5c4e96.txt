Most cases of acute PE are treated with anticoagulation therapy and supportive care, and the embolism undergoes autothrombolysis.  In the cases of hemodynamic instability, patients receive thrombolytic therapy.  When long-term anticoagulation therapy is contraindicated, an IVC filter can be placed.
An acute pulmonary embolism can be seen beyond the bifurcation of the left pulmonary artery as a filling defect with the contrast media.  Incidental left saline breast implant.
Pulmonary Embolism

37-year-old woman with a chief complaint of chest pain, fever of 103, and left flank pain.  She had a questionable left lower lobe infiltrate on plain film.  The patient was sent for a CT-pulmonary angiogram for a suspected pulmonary embolus (PE).
