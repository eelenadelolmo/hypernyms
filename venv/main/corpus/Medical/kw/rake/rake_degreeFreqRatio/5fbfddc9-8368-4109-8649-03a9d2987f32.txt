Shunt revision.
Axial T2 MRI from 3 months prior to presentation demonstrating baseline lateral ventricular size.
Lateral radiograph of the skull on presentation (as part of a VP shunt evaluation series) demonstrating a disconnection at a branch point of the shunt system external to the skull at the right temporal region.
Non-contrast CT of the head demonstrating enlarged lateral ventricles.
Post shunt revision non-contrast CT of the head demonstrating mild decrease in the size of the lateral ventricle as well as the post revision head CT scout image demonstrating shunt disconnection repair.
Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Failure secondary to tubing disconnection.
Shunt disconnection--diagnostic images.
17 year-old-male with new onset headaches and a history of a VP shunt.
Please see factoid.
