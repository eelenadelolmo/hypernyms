No treatment required
Two-view chest x-ray:  
FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographic views of the chest demonstrate stable appearance of complete situs inversus.  Left atrial and ventricular enlargement is again noted, grossly stable from prior examination. The lungs are grossly clear.  Median sternotomy wires remain intact.  Degenerative changes are visualized throughout the bony structures.  
 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Stable appearance of left atrial and ventricular enlargement in the setting of dextrocardia.


PA PROTOCOL CHEST CT: 
FINDINGS:  There are sternotomy wires surrounded by bone, suggesting surgery at a young age.  There is mirror image anatomy of the heart and upper abdominal organs, findings consistent with the patient"s known situs inversus.  The patient has a left-sided aortic arch with mirror image branching vessels.
 
The right side of the heart is enlarged, as is the main pulmonary artery, which demonstrates some possible focal narrowing just distal to the pulmonic valve.
 
There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.  There is focal band-like attenuation in the lower lungs, likely representing bibasilar atelectasis. No bronchiectasis is seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. Findings consistent with situs inversus with a left aortic arch and mirror image branching vessels.
2.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 
 

CT HEMATURIA PROTOCOL (ABDOMEN/PELVIS):  
FINDINGS:  Situs inversus is noted.
Situs Inversus with Dextrocardia
-Asplenia/Polysplenia
-Congenital Coronary Abnormalities
-Sinusitis
-Ventricular Septal Defect
-The most common cause of false-positive results is the technologist"s or radiologist"s inattention to proper labeling. 
-Kartagener Syndrome
64 y.o. woman with symptoms of pulmonary embolism.
Situs abnormalities may be recognized first by using radiography or ultrasonography. However, CT is the preferred examination for the definitive diagnosis of situs inversus with dextrocardia.

Patients with situs inversus usually have a normal life expectancy. In the rare instances of cardiac anomalies, life expectancy is reduced, depending on the severity of the defect. Patients with Kartagener syndrome have a normal life expectancy if the bronchiectasis is treated adequately.
