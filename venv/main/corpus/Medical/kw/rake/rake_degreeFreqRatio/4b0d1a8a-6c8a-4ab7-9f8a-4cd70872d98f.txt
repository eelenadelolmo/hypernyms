Steriods and radiation therapy
Three enhancing lesions - the largest of which is in the right thalamus.
Primary CNS Lymphoma
â€¢ Metastatic disease
â€¢ Multiple Sclerosis
â€¢ Lymphoma
62 year old previously healthy woman presents with dizziness, headache and slurred speech.
All of lesions either decreased in size or resolved following high dose steroid administration.  This why PCNSL is sometimes called the "ghost tumor" - because the lesions can rapidly disappear.  The yield on tissue biopsy can also drop if the tissue is sampled after a course of steroid therapy.
