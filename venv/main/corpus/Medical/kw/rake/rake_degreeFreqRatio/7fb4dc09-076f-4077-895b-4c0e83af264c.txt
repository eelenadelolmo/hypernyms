ORIF of the Hill-Sachs deformity and Bankhart lesion
Multiple images of the left shoulder demonstrate evidence of previous Hill Sachs deformity and bony Bankart repair.  There are three threaded screws traversing the superior lateral aspect of the humeral head, stabilizing an osteochondral graft for repair of a Hill-Sachs deformity.  There are additional partially threaded screws traversing the glenoid for repair of a bony Bankart lesion.  There is satisfactory glenohumeral alignment.
