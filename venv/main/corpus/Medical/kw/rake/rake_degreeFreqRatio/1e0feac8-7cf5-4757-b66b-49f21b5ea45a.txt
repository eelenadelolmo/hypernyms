Texto: 
Swelling and edema in the left periorbital region with a depressed globe (enophthalmos).
Because of the damage from rupture, the patient had an enucleation of the left globe.
Â» Abnormal morphology and contour of the left globe with associated hemorrhage
Â» Abnormal increased attenuation O.S.
Â» Fractures left orbit- lateral, posterior, and inferior  walls
Â» Air fluid level within the left maxillary sinus
Rupture of the left globe with associated orbital wall fractures.
Blow-out Fracture
Globe rupture
Globe hemorrhage
Ocular tumor
Presented to the emergency department after being hit in the face by a softball.
With rupture of the globe, this patient is at risk for sympathetic ophthalmia.  This is a potentially blinding immune mediated, inflammatory condition, which usually follows severe trauma to one eye. The mechanism of injury must be a traumatic penetrating or rupturing injury to the eye involving the region of the ciliary body.  The immune system becomes exposed to antigens in the eye it has never responded to before. This immune system reaction can then result in complete vision loss of the un-injured eye.

Treatment: early enucleation within two weeks of injury can be protective.
