WDWNWM in NAD. He had exquisite tenderness to palpation in right lower quadrant. Laboratory analyis was unremarkable.
Endovascular placement of covered stent to exclude PSA.
CT revealed an end-to-side aortic-right external iliac bypass graft, with an aneurysm at the distal anastomosis. There was also a near obstructing carcinoma in the ascending colon, which brought the patient to medical attention. 

Although there was no evidence of aneurysm rupture, the patientâ€™s worsening symptoms prompted angiography and placement of a 10 mm x 4 cm stent-graft (Bard Fluency, Tempe, Az.)  Completion arteriogram demonstrates excellent exclusion of the aneurysm sac with no evidence of endoleak.  There were no complications from the procedure. The patient underwent extended right colectomy 3 days later.

 DISCUSSION: While endovascular stent-grafting has become an established treatment for atherosclerotic aneurysm, other applications are constantly evolving. The vascular surgery literature has come to advocate endovascular stent-grafts as treatment for the so-called para-anastomotic aneurysm (PAA). These commonly occur at the distal anastomosis of a bifurcated aorto-iliac bypass graft.1 At 15 year followup, the cumulative incidence of iliac artery PAAs is >20%.2 Exclusion of the aneurysm sac from systemic pressure and flow is necessary to prevent rupture and thrombosis. 

In a study of 35 PAAs conducted by Morrisey et al., 34 were successfully excluded by means of an endovascular stent-graft. This included three patients with acute rupture. Eighteen of these patients had iliac artery PAAs.3 Van Herwaarden et al. reported a series of 14 patients with PAAs, 8 of which involved the iliac arteries. At a median followup of 12 months, all aneurysm sacs remained excluded.4 

Most recently, Tielliu et al. performed a prospective study where 35 patients with 40 iliac artery aneurysms were treated with stent-grafts. There were 26 PAAs in this series. Only one aneurysm was not effectively excluded, but this was corrected on the first postoperative day by embolization of the native external iliac vessel (type II endoleak). One-month followup revealed only 2 complications: one graft occlusion, and one type I endoleak.1 

Endovascular therapy offers multiple advantages over an open repair. First, because there is no dissection through scarred fields, there is less risk of iatrogenic injury to vessels and organs and less blood loss. Second, the procedure can be performed under conscious sedation. This is particularly beneficial in the typical patient with tenuous cardiovascular status. Third, small groin incisions pose less risk for infection and problems with healing when compared to large midline incisions.3 

However, the technique is not without problems. The hypogastric artery may be intentionally sacrificed, or inadvertently occluded, leading to pelvic ischemia and symptoms such as gluteal claudication. This is typically only a concern when the contralateral hypogastric artery is occluded already. Migration of the device or collateral flow can result in an endoleak. Also, the inherent risks of angiography are not to be ignored. Nevertheless, in the case of an uncomplicated iliac artery PAA, it can be argued that the benefits of endovascular stent-grafting far outweigh the risks of open repair.
