TSH .005  FT4 4.6

Cachetic elderly male with non tender , nodular thyroid
Patient treated with Methimazole - mechanism : decreases thyroid hormone production - inhibits iodine and peroxidase from their normal interactions with thyroglobulin to form T4 and T3; also interferes with the conversion of T4 to T3.
Thyroid Uptake and scan with I-131 7.00 uCi PO and   
99mTcO4 10.00 mCi IV shows mutliple foci of increased and decreased radiotracer uptake on the scan. The uptake is 45.8%
Ultrasound images show multiple rather well circumscribed foci of decreased echogenicity.
Toxic multinodular goiter
Multinodular Goiter
80 year old male presents with fifty pound weight loss and atrial fibrillation
This patient initially was diagnosed with Toxic multinodular goiter in 2004. His treatment was with Tapazole as described above. He fogot to take his medication for a few weeks and was readmitted to the hospital for syncope/atrial fibrillation. The second scan you with only 13.2 percent uptake is secondary to his being restarted on Tapazole two days before the scan, thus giving a fictitious result.
