There is an area of palpable concern in the inferior left breast.
The patient was referred to a surgical breast oncologist.  Surgical resection was offered, but the patient declined.  The patient is being followed clinically.
Mammography (fig 1) demonstrates an ovoid mass in the inferior left breast.  Left breast ultrasound (fig 2) demonstrates a wider-than-tall 1.8cm ovoid mass with macrolobulated borders and echotexture similar to surrounding adipose tissue.

PASH
She "felt a lump" under her left breast; she has a history of bilateral reduction mammoplasty six years earlier (without complication).
PASH is an uncommon cause of an enlarging breast mass in a pre-menopausal female.[1,2]  PASH is more often found incidentally on breast biopsy or for biopsy of an enlarging area of asymmetrically dense breast tissue.[3]  As this case demonstrates, the mass-like form of PASH (“tumoral” PASH) may be isoechoic with, or hypoechoic to, surrounding breast tissue and may be difficult to identify sonographically, especially in the setting of prior reduction mammoplasty. 
     Pathologically, PASH is characterized by myofibroblasts simulating vascular channels in dense stromal collagen tissue.  As a result, PASH can be visually similar to vascular breast lesions (such as angiosarcoma), but differentiation is is usually not difficult for an experienced patholgist.[4]  The pathogenesis of PASH remains uncertain, but aberrant reactivation of myofibroblasts to endogenous or exogenous hormones is likely to be an important factor.
   Surgical management usually includes simple excision for enlarging lesions.  However, disease recurrence can occur in up to 10 – 25% of cases.  In addition, a diffuse form of PASH can occur and often presents a difficult management problem that may necessitate mastectomy.   To date, no studies have been performed to determine whether alternative treatments such as hormonal treatment or cryotherapy could be effective in treatment of PASH.
Discussion of radiologic-pathologic concordance is important after biopsy, and a diagnosis of PASH is concordant with an enlarging breast mass.  While surgical excision is usually recommended, it may be complicated in the setting of prior breast surgery, such as bilateral reduction mammoplasty as in this case.
