0.3 cm echogenic, extra-testicular focus within the left scrotal sac.
Scrotolith - etiology unknown
â€¢ Inflammation of tunica vaginalis

â€¢ Calcified hematoma

â€¢ Torsion of appendix testis

â€¢ Sequelae of meconium peritonitis
24 year old male with palpable, mobile scrotal mass
Although the etiology in this case is not known, this is likely to be a calcified hematoma - since the patient had recently experienced trauma to the area.

Scrotoliths are also associated with mountain biking:
