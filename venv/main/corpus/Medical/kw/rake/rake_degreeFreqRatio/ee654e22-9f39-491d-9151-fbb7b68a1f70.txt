Following intravenous injection of 25 mCi of 99mTc-Sestamibi, 10 minute anterior and posterior images of the neck and chest were obtained at 20 minutes and 2 hours later.
The patient will undergo a surgical removal of a parathyroid adenoma.
Early thyroid phase at 20 minutes post injection demonstrates diffuse distribution of the 99mTc-Sestamibi in the thyroid gland with focal accumulation in the lower pole of the left thyroid lobe. 
 
Delayed parathyroid phase at 2 hour post injection demonstrates washout of activity from the thyroid gland with a persistent focal accumulation in the lower pole of the left thyroid lobe, consistent with a parathyroid adenoma.
SOLITARY PARATHYROID ADENOMA
Parathyroid adenoma, thyroid adenoma, thyroid carcinoma, and parathyroid carcinoma.
52 year old male with abnormally elevated PTH and ionized Calcium. The patient is referred for a localization of parathyroid adenoma.
