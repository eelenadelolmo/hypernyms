Texto: 
The mass was first biopsied and a large amount of straw colored fluid was aspirated from it.  Subsequently, a repeat surgery was performed to resect the entire mass.  The patient later received radiation therapy.
6 cm right frontal lobe mass with surrounding vasogenic edema and small linear calcification.  There is a 2.3 cm right to left midline shift, as well as interpeduncular cistern and bilateral lateral ventricle effacement due to mass effect from the tumor.
Gemistocytic Astrocytoma
Cystic astrocytoma
Parasitic cyst
Cerebral abscess
44 year old man with headache
Factors favoring a low grade rather than a high grade glioma include the fact that the adjacent corpus callosum is not involved and the associated calcification.
