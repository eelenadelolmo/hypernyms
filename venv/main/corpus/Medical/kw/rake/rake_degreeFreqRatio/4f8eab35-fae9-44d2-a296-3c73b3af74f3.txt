Multiple purple cutaneous lesions
Supportive
Moderate enhancement of pial surface right hemisphere consistent with leptomeningeal angiomatosis.

Diffuse enlargment of medullary and convexity veins over right cerebral hemisphere and left cerebellar hemisphere.  Marked enlargement of central venous sinuses.

The affected right hemisphere is actually smaller - this is easier to demonstrate by measuring the diameter.

Normal arteries on MRA brain
Sturge-Weber Syndrome, diffuse cerebral developmental venous anomalies
• AVM
• Sturge-Weber Syndrome
• Developmental Venous Anomalies
• Venous thrombosis
11 year old boy with long history of seizures.  Previously evaluated at  (withheld) Clinic in New York.  Developmental delay and multiple skin lesions on face and chest
