Radiographically it is a broad-based, juxtacortical, densely ossified mass, the periphery somewhat less dense that the base. CT scan is most useful and can demonstrate a radiolucent zone of periosteum and fibrous tissue trapped between the tumor and cortex. The lesion may consist of three layers: at the cortical surface it is dense and compact, it has a middle layer of amorphous dense bone, and the outer layer there are dense spicules extending into the periphery. These tumors typically have a low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and a high signal intensity on T2-weighted images.  The lesion may eventually progress to cortical destruction and medullary invasion, MRI can be used to grade the extent of tumor extension and cortical disruption.
Parosteal Osteogenic Sarcoma
myositis ossificans
osteochondroma 
periosteal sarcoma
26 y/o male with a mass for past 18 months on lower leg. There is no history of trauma.  The patient does not have any fever or chills, and he notes occasional pain at the site of the mass.
