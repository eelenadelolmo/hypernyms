Arcuate uterus

Pelvic Endometriosis
Scaring or post surgical sequelae
Tubal adenomyosis

Didelphys Uterus
35 Year-old female with history of infertility
The uniqueness in this case is the fact that on the initial images, it appears as if there was normal spillage on the left, when in fact, the contrast was mixing within the fluid filled obstructed fallopian tube as it slowly started to distend. When in doubt, more contrast can be injected and the side that has spilled normally should be positioned posteriorly, in this manner, the spilled contrast will not obscure the contralateral side in question.
