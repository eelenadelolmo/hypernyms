Admission findings included dizziness, balance disturbances, ophthalmoparesis and bilateral sustained clonus with Achilles reflex.

Serial lumbar punctures showed increased WBCs.  Protein and glucose were essentially normal.
Patient treated with antibiotics initially, without significant improvement.  Patient then treated with corticosteroids, at which time a significant improvement in symptoms was observed.
Multifocal enhancing signal abnormalities within brainstem and basal ganglia initially, with lesion at grey/white matter junction in frontal lobe (later finding).  Punctate area of hemorrhage in midbrain.  Subsequent examination revealed new lesions.  Some existing lesions improved over the course of two weeks, while others worsened.
Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
• Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
• Multiple sclerosis (MS)
• Rhombencephalitis
• Lymphoma
25 y.o. man with a history of presumed viral meningitis one month ago.  Hes has been seen four times at hospital for various focal neurological complaints before these images were obtained.
With rapidly progressing neurologic findings following a viral infection, the patient in this case demonstrates a typical story for ADEM.  On MR imaging, the multiple and asymmetric lesions helped to differentiate ADEM from the fewer and more symmetric lesions of MS.  Additionally, the presence of basal ganglia lesions or large, globular white matter lesions is more suggestive of ADEM.  The uniform enhancement of all the lesions in this patient also suggests a monophasic illness, such as ADEM, and the hemorrhagic lesion seen in this patient is not characteristic of MS.  On initial imaging of this patient, only the brainstem lesions were apparent, warranting the inclusion of rhombencephalitis in the differential.  However, the appearance of cortical lesions on follow-up examination helped to exclude that disease process.  Early and late images in this patient showed a rapidly progressing and remitting pattern unlikely to be produced by a lymphoma.  Additionally, this patient demonstrated the tendency for the lesions of ADEM to worsen radiographically on short-term follow-up, even though the patient improved clinically with treatment.
