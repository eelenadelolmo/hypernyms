There are multiple area of hypoattenuation and filling defect within the right and left pulmonary arteries.  There is a comet shaped area of hypoattenuation extending from the left pulmonary artery nearly to the branch point of the main pulmonry artery.

61 years-old man with known stage II pancreatic cancer.  Underwent contrast CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis for pre-operative evaluation.
Venous thromboembolic disease, especially resulting in pulmonary embolism represents a significant disease burden in terms of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients1.  Thrombus, or clot, often forms in the proximal, deep leg veins and only may only become clinically evident once a thrombus segment has embolized[1, 2].  Upon embolization from a vein (in the proximal leg or elsewhere) the first bed of vessels of decreasing diameter is usually the lungs, where the embolus may lodge occluding blood flow and creating clinically significant or insignificant (based on size) ventilation-perfusion mismatches[1, 3].  The progression from thrombus formation in the legs to pulmonary embolism is believed to account for up to 10% of hospital deaths[1].  Tragically, acute pulmonary embolism is among the leading causes of preventable hospital deaths in the United States[4].
	Detection and therapy for acute pulmonary embolism, once it has become clinically apparent is difficult and often without optimum result.  The best method of preventing pulmonary embolism is to prevent primary thrombus formation[1, 4].  Extensive clinical trials have resulted in revised clinical guidelines in 2007 for the prevention and management of venous thrombosis and venous thromboembolic disease[2, 5].  These new recommendations state that (1) low molecular weight heparins are preferable to unfractionated heparins in inpatient populations; (2) low molecular weight heparins are safe and cost effective for treating deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in selected outpatients; (3) compression stocking should be utilized to prevent postthrombotic syndrome within one month of diagnosis and used for a minimum of one year; (4) there is inadequate evidence to recommend specific types of anticoagulation in pregnant women; (5) recommendations on length of treatment; and (6) low molecular weight heparin is safe and efficacious for long term treatment on venous thromboembolism in selected patients, such as those with cancer[2, 5].  For additional information on this complex and everchanging topic, the reader is directed to the references below and the references’ references.
