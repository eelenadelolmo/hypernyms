41 y/o female with incidental finding on CT for abdominal pain.
Approximately 80% of renal AML's are incidental.  20% are associated with Tuberous Sclerosis.  Conversely, 80% of patients with Tuberous Sclerosis will develop renal AML's which are often multiple in these patients.  Of note, renal AML's occur in 15% of patients with lymphangiomyomatosis (LAM).
