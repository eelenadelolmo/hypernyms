Texto: 
Lungs were clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam demonstrated regular rate and rhythm.  Normal blood count.
No treatment is currently recommended.  On 3D reconstruction, there appears to be no obstruction of the airways and the patient is minimally symptomatic.  If the patient continues to have worsening symptoms you might consider a bronchoscopy to assess airway patency.  You may also consider obtaining a FISH to look for a deletion on chromosome 22.  However, this patient appears to have thymic tissue on CT, which tends to be absent in patients with the DiGeorge syndrome.
â€¢ Chest x-ray â€“ Bilateral hyperinflation of the lungs
â€¢ XR fluoro upper GI w/KUB â€“ Well coordinated swallowing mechanism. No tracheal aspiration was observed. There is a posterior indentation on the esophagus possibly indicative of a vascular ring.
â€¢ CT chest w/o contrast â€“ shows branching of the ascending and descending aorta
Double aortic arch
â€¢ Double aortic arch
â€¢ Right aortic arch
â€¢ Asthma
â€¢ RSV infection
â€¢ Subglottic stenosis
â€¢ Tracheomalacia
This baby boy was brought to an outpatient office with a history of noisy breathing since birth. Symptoms have progressed over the last 4 months, with onset of continuous cough throughout the day. The patient has a previous ER visit for noted increased work of breathing, wheeze, cough and congestion. Patientâ€™s grandmother feels that the child gags with solids. 
 
Birth History: Full term, 40 weeks with no complications. Vaginal delivery, patient went home in 7 days after hospitalization in NICU.
Generally double aortic arch may be treated with surgical resection.  However, surgery is not recommended in this patient because there appears to be no tracheal obstruction.
