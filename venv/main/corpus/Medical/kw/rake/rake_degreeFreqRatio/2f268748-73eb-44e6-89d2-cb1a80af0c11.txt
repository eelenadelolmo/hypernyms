Patient has diffuse swelling of the left hand and marked tenderness to palpation over distal ulna on both palmar and dorsal aspects of the left wrist.  Limited range of motion of wrist.
The acute injury should be treated with an initial closed reduction as soon as possible to reduce the risk of nerve injury.  Because of the significant risk of malunion of the scaphoid fracture and subsequent avascular necrosis of the proximal pole of the scaphoid and the multiple ligamentous injuries affecting the carpal-radial alignment, an open reduction and internal fixation is the standard of care for all perilunate fracture/dislocations.  When intraoperative radiographs demonstrate near perfect restoration of normal alignment, the wrist and forearm are placed in a sugar tong splint for 2 weeks followed by a short arm cast for 8 weeks.

2.	Transverse fracture of triquetrium. 
3.	Posterior dislocation of capitate in relationship to the lunate
Transscaphoid-transtriquetrial perilunate fracture dislocation

2.	Scaphocapitate syndrome
3.	Axial-radial wrist dislocation
20 year-old male presents to Primary Care Clinic with marked pain and swelling of left hand after fall onto outstretched left hand while playing basketball.
Perilunate fracture-dislocations are present in approximately 5% of wrist fractures and are the result of high energy trauma that forces the wrist into extension and ulnar deviation. (1)  Although this trauma can be due to a fall on an outstretched hand, this injury is also seen during motor vehicle accidents and falls from heights.  The force can cause intercarpal supination with resultant damage to the intracarpal ligaments and/or fracture of  the carpal bones.(1)  The radial styloid and the scaphoid are the most common bones fractured in this injury, but the triquetrium and the capitate can also be fractured from the arc-shaped impact within the carpal rows.  The perilunate fracture dislocations are also called a greater arc injury.

Several classification schemes have been proposed, but none of them provides a complete description of the fractures and ligament damage.  On the radiographs, the key finding for a perilunate dislocation or lunate dislocation is a disruption of the linear alignment of the distal radius, lunate and capitate on the lateral radiograph.  This alignment is commonly described as an apple in a teacup in a saucer.  In a perilunate dislocation, the capitate is displaced dorsally while the lunate and radius remain in normal position, as seen in this patient.  In a lunate dislocation, the lunate is displaced in the volar direction (‚Äúspilled teacup sign‚Äù),  may thereby impact the median nerve and cause peripheral neuropathy. (2)

Transscaphoid fractures occur with approximately 60% of perilunate dislocations due to the unique position of the scaphoid in that bridges the proximal and distal carpal rows. (1)  Other fractures are less common but occur when the force of the injury is strong enough to disrupt the bone instead of the associated ligament.  The transscaphoidal and transtriquetral fractures have been observed in approximately 5% of perilunate dislocations in two small retrospective studies (3)  

Because the scaphoid receives its major blood supply to the proximal pole from an artery that enters near the waist, a fracture of the waist or proximal pole may compromise the integrity of vascular supply to the proximal pole.  The risk of avascular necrosis of the proximal pole is 30% for a fracture of the middle 1/3 of the scaphoid and 100% for a fracture of the proximal 1/5 of the bone. (2)  Even if the vascularity is not disrupted enough to cause avascular necrosis, there will usually be delayed healing.  Although an open reduction is recommended to restore a proper alignment, some orthopedic surgeons use percutaneous pinning to reduce the risk of further reduction of the vascular supply from the operative manipulation.

The long-term deficit from these injuries usually involves some loss of grip strength and residual stiffness, even if the alignment of the reduction is perfectly restored.  The final range of motion is often limited as well.    The outcome is determined by the severity of the initial trauma and the delay in treatment.
