Axial and Coronal T1 pre and post gadolinium and T2 weighted images demonstrate a diffusely enhancing T1 isointense, T2 hyperintense locally invasive mass of the left lobe of the thyroid.  There is local invasion through the posterior aspect of the first tracheal ring, and asymmetric thickening of the vocal cords.
Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
Papillary, Follicular, Mixed, Cystic, Medullary, and Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinomas
Thyroid Adenoma
25 year old male with history of neck mass.
In this case, invasive thyroid cancer was initially suspected.  As this case demonstrates, when invasive malignancies of the neck are involved, one must always consider adenoid cystic carcinoma, as minor salivary glands can occur in numerous locations throughout the neck.
