CN VI palsy.
Mild hemiparesis
Radiation therapy
Stable appearing postoperative bed left parietal lobe.
Multiple enhancing intradural lesions at the conus and surrounding the cauda equina.
Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis from endometrial Carcinoma.
• Sarcoidosis
• Neurofibromatosis
• Myxopapillary Epenymoma
• Carcinomatous meningitis
68 year old woman who had right parietal lobe tumor resected two years previously.  The lesion was metastatic from an endometrial carcinoma.  Now presents with new onset right CN VI palsy and back pain.
The spinal canal lesions are likely from leptomeningeal spread of the brain metastatic lesion resected two year previously rather than hematogenous spread of the primary tumor of the endometrium.
