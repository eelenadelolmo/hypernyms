Brain Death
21 year old woman who presented with worsening headaches.  After admission, she had mental status changes.  A head CT showed diffuse cerebral edema and herniation.  The patient became unresponsive.
Autopsy results were inconclusive, but cerebral microemboli suggested a diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).
