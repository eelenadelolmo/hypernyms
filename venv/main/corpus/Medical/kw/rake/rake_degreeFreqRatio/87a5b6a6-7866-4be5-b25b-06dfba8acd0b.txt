Texto: 
Sagittal T1-weighted image of the brain showing a focal area of small gyri with loss of sulcation in the posterior frontal lobe.
Polymicrogyria involving the posterior frontal lobe
Polymicrogyria
3 year old caucasian male with profound developmental delay.
This finding is associated not only with developmental delay, but can potentially be a seizure focus.
