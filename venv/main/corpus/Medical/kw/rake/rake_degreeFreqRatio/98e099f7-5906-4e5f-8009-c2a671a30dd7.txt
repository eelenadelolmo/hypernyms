Tender right lower quadrant and right inguinal canal
No fever
Normal WBC
Patient was manually reduced and will be scheduled for inguinal hernia repair.
Contrast enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis reveal the vermiform appendix extending  through the internal inguinal ring with the tip of the appendix located in the mid portion of the inguinal canal.
Amyand's hernia
None
75 year old male with right lower quadrant pain.  On further discussion with the referring provider, the pain is located most intensely in the right inguinal canal.  The patient has had similar pain, on and off, over the past year.
Please note that in the literature, an Amyand's hernia may refer to the original case, i.e.  perforated appendix within the inguinal canal, unperforated appendicitis within the inguinal canal, or simply the appendix within the inguinal canal (as in this case).
