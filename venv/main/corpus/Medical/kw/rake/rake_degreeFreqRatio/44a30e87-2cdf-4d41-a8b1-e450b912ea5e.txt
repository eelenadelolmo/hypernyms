Normal neck exam.
Alkaline Phosphate 1252 U/L (Normal 38-126)
Phosphorus Low, Calcium High
Surgery: 95% successful, often perform 3.5 parathyroidectomy and place the 0.5 most normal tissue in forearm.
T99M-Sestamibi, Dose: 20 mCi i.v.
Scan 20 minutes and 2 1/2 hours after dosing. Patient supine with chin up and neck extended (sternal and chin markers).
Focal radiotracer uptake within region of the right and left superior poles of the thyroid on delayed images consistent with parathyroid hyperplasia/adenomas.
Hyperparathyroidism
Parathyroid adenoma
Parathyroid adenoma
Parathyroid hyperplasia
Follicular thyroid adenoma
Lymphoma
40 y.o. female with elevated serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels.  Please evaluate for parathyroid adenoma.
Findings:

•T99M-Sestamibi, Dose: 20 mCi i.v.
•Scan 20 minutes and 2 1/2 hours after dosing. Patient supine with chin up and neck extended (sternal and chin markers)
•Sestamibi demonstrates slower washout from parathyroid adenomas and hyperplastic parathyroid glands compared with surrounding thyroid tissue.
•Sensitivity for parathyroid adenomas 90%. (Less for hyperplasia)
•False Positives: Follicular thyroid adenoma, Lymphoma
•Dual imaging has problems: 1. Misregistration causing inaccurate subtraction, 2. Other lesions (mets) can mimic parathyroid adenomas and take up Tl-201, 3. Relative uptake of Tl-201 and Tc-99m pertechnetate may be altered by other pathology (MNG, Follicular adenoma)
Focal radiotracer uptake within region of the right and left superior poles of the thyroid on delayed images consistent with parathyroid hyperplasia/adenomas.

Differential Diagnosis and Discussion:

•Parathyroid adenoma
•Parathyroid hyperplasia
•Follicular thyroid adenoma
•Lymphoma

•Hyperactive parathyroid tissue causes increased parathyroid hormone, elevated serum calcium and excretion.
•Women:Men 2:1, 85% of hyperparathyroidism caused by a single PT adenoma. 15% from hyperplasia.
•Majority have 4 glands, but variants often occur. 
•Superior 2 glands derive from 4th pharyngeal pouch (C cells of thyroid) and often can be within the gland. Inferior 2 glands derive from 3rd PP and may migrate anywhere towards thymus.
•Most often within 2 cm and 1cm of thyroid, respectively. Imaging is crucial for operative planning.
•Typically diagnosed by serum calcium and parathyroid levels. Option to medically follow if levels <11.5 mg/dL.
•Surgery is 95% successful, often perform 3.5 parathyroidectomy and place 0.5 most normal tissue in forearm.



Final Diagnosis:
Parathyroid adenoma
