Helical axial CT images of the liver: Pre-contrast phase in both soft tissue and liver windows demonstrate a homogeneously hypodense lesion in the left lobe, medial segment. Arterial phase demonstrates peripheral heterogenous enhancement of the lesion. Portal phase images demonstrates continued heterogenous globular and peripheral fill-in of the lesion.
Liver Hemangioma
Hypervascular malignant neoplasms (Quick homogenous filling during arterial phases but does NOT remain hyperdense on delayed-phase images (30 min.)).
Hepatic adenoma
Hepatic angiosarcoma
Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (c/w giant cavernous hemangiomas)
48 year old woman scanned for kidney stones (nephrolithiasis).
