Texto: 
The patient was treated with bilateral total hip arthroplasties.
Radiograph of the pelvis demonstrates increased density within the femoral heads of both hips. An MRI shows increased signal on IR sequence and serpentine appearance on both the IR and T1 weighted sequences. The cortex is intact.
Avascular Necrosis - MRI diagnosis
Avascular necrosis
Fracture at subchondral bone
57 year old male with bilateral hip pain. No other history given.
Staging for AVN by the classic Ficat and Arlet classification:

Stage 1: Trabecula normal to porotic. +/- double line sign on T2 weighted MRI

Stage 2:Sclerosis of trabeculae

Stage 3: Loss of spherical shape of femoral head

Stage 4: Collapse of femoral head with advanced osteoarthritic changes
