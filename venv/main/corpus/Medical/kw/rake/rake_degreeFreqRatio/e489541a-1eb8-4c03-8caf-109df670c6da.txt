EOMI, PERRL, no ptosis or nystagmus, corneal reflex intact, face symmetrical, gag intact, good tongue protrusion, moves all four extremities spontaneously and against resistance, normal tone and bulk, withdraws and localizes, DTR 2/4, toes upgoing, no clonus, (+) moro, (+) grasp, normal root and suck, no ataxic movements

Test results:
CBC: 10.5/11/31.8/490 N21 L67 E5 M6
CHEM: 137/4.9/103/24/10/0.4/96 Mg1.7 Phos 5.7 Alb6.7 Glob 4.2 Bili 0.2 ALP 225 ALT 68 AST 45
ECHO: Small to moderate ASD/PFO with Left to Right shunts. Suggestion of multiple small discrete echodensities along endocardial surface of Left side of intraventricular septum. Intracardiac anatomy and function appears otherwise normal 
RUS: No evidence of angiomyolipomas bilaterally
EEG: right sided focal slowing, no hypsarrhythmia
DNA testing:
This patient was found to be heterozygous for the 1334ins T nucleotide change in exon 12 of the TSC2 gene. Although this alteration has not previously reported, given its frameshift nature, it is thought to be a deleterious mutation confirming a diagnosis of Tuberous Sclerosis
Seizures were initially controlled with Phenobarbital, but then the patient developed infantile spasms.  Patient is now on vigabatrine and followed in a neurocutaneous clinic.
Head CT: 
1.  There are calcified subependymal nodules as well as calcified hamartomas.
2.  Patchy bone mineralization of the skull without discrete evidence of skull fracture.
MRI of the brain: 
Multiple T1 hyperintense T2 hypointense parenchymal tubers are seen.  The most prominent of these is in the right parietal lobe.
There are multiple subependymal nodules seen.
These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis.

2.	Complex Partial Seizures

4.	Infantile Spasm (West Syndrome),
5.	Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome
6.	Hypomelanotic macules
7.	Brain tumor
3 m.o. female was brought to ER with a complaint of two episodes of generalized shaking activity that lasted about 3 min. each. Mother also reported abnormal movements occurring since one month of age in which she noted that the baby had paroxysmal left sided mouth twitching and leftward eye deviation. Patient would have several similar episodes a day.
Previous history: baby was born full term, by repeated C-section, birth weight 8lbs 5 oz, no complications
Family history is significant for maternal cousin who had seizures and died at young age from car accident.
