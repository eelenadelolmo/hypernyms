Texto: 
Focal tenderness to the posterior medial distal-mid right tibia.
Referred for immediate Othopedic consultation and treated with immobilization and non-weight bearing, with a gradual return to activity.

(By report had bilateral tibial stress fractures)
2-phase focally increased activity with a fusiform configuration on the delayed images oriented in an unusual (for a simple stress fracture) oblique configuration, and appearing to involve the entire cortical diameter.  

Zoomed in images of plain radiographs demonstrate periosteal reaction and also endosteal callus formation seen in the posterior-medial cortex of the distal-mid right tibia.  Additionally, there is a linear lucency seen in the cortex that is obliquely oriented in relation to the long axis of the shaft.  The corresponds to the abnormality seen on the bone scan.

No abnormality is seen in the left tibia.
Right Tibial (Completed) Stress Fracture.
DDx for 2 or 3-phase focally increased bone scan activity.
1- Trauma (including fracture)
2- Infection
3- Bone Tumor
22 year old woman Marine who had been on limited duty for an extended period of time
This young woman had earlier conservative treatment (restricted activity) for bilateral tibial stress fractures.  Because her symptoms had improved, she recently ran for a physical fitness test.  After running that, she had an acute exacerbation of symptoms.

In this particular case, the intense radiotracer uptake is more obliquely oriented in relation to the long axis of the cortex, which suggested a complete fracture of the cortex.  Radiographs, performed immediately following the bone scan, demonstrate a visible linear lucency within the posterior medial cortex of the right tibia, indicating a completed stress fracture.  Additionally there is periosteal reaction and callous formation seen in the region of the fracture site.
