Longitudinal color doppler sonographic image of the left lingual artery using a Siemens Accuson Sequoia 512 with a small parts 8V5 probe.  Once the artery was localized, the position was traced on the tongue surface using a sterile marking pen.  Technique was repeated on the opposite side.

Note: The 8V5 probe was used because it was the smallest available at the time.  This probe is designed for pediatric heads, but was bulky and awkward inside the patient's mouth.  For future procedures, would recommend using the smaller "hockey stick" if available.
