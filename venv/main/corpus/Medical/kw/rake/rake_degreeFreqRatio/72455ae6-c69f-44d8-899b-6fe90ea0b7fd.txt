â€¢ Occlusion left Common Carotid Artery.
â€¢ "Stump" of proximal  Right Common carotid artery is still patent.
â€¢ Collateral flow via muscular branches from right Vertebral artery with retrograde flow right External Carotid artery maintaining antegrade flow in the right ICA.
Common Carotid Occlusion, collateral reconstitution of ipsilateral ICA from vertebral artery muscular branches
None
58 y.o. woman with a prior stroke in 2007.  She had a right ICA stent placed at that time.  Now, she is asymptomatic -  but her doppler ultrasound suggests a recurrent stenosis of right ICA in the neck.
