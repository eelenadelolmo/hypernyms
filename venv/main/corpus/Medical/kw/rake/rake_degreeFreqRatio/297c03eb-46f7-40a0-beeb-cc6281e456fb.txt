labs non-contributory
Corrective surgery
The lungs are adequately inflated. There is no focal air-space opacity or gross evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is abnormal, with an upturned apex and ovoid shape, with mild enlargement. There is abnormal narrowing of the superior mediastinum. The pulmonary vascularity is abnormally prominent.
