Texto: 
Axial CT angiogram with oblique sagital reconstructions of aortic arch. There is focal narrowing of the aorta just distal to the takeoff of the left subclavian artery in the juxtaductal region.
Coarctation of the Aorta
Status-post repair of a juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta with residual narrowing at the repair site.
45 yo male with prior history of repair of coarctation of the aorta at 18 months of age now with decreased distal lower extremity pulses.
