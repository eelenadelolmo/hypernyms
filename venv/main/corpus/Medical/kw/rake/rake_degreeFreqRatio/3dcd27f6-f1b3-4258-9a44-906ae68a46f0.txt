Optic atrophy
Low serum testosterone levels.
T3 and T4 levels low normal
Lesion was resected and is pathologically proven. 
Hormone replacement therapy
1.2 cm enhancing mass involving the pituitary stalk
Mild compression of chiasm.
Hemangioblastoma, pituitary stalk
• Rathke cleft cyst
• Hypothalamic glioma
• Craniopharyngioma
• Eosinophilic Granuloma (Langerhan Histiocytosis
• Pituitary Adenoma
• Hamartoma of the Tuber Cinereum
33 year old man presented with visual field problems
Post operative scans reveal complete tumor removal.  No evidence of residual infundibulum.  Tumor completely replaced the pituitary stalk at surgery.  This is, obviously, a very unusual location and presentation for hemangioblastoma.   Most commonly, hemangioblastoma is a cerebellar lesion; and, is associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease in about 20% of cases.  More on hemangioblastoma:
