Child look well and in no acute distress. Afebrile. HEENT exam unremarkable. Neurological examination unremarkable.
The patient was started on Keppra and an escalating dose will be utilized until seizures are adequately controlled. Follow up MRI will be performed if symptoms worsen or changes.
Focal area of abnornal signal intensity in the right posterior right parietal occipital region predominantly involving the parasagittal cortex. Decreased signal intensity on T1 weighted images and increase signal intensity on T2 weighted images and isointense in FLAIR sequences. No enhancement was seen with administration of contrast.
Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumor
Dysembryonic Neuroepithelial Tumor, Ganglioglioma, Oligodendroglioma,and Low-grade Astrocytoma.
A 2-year, 10-month old Caucasian female presented to her Pediatrician for complaint of new onset seizures times four weeks per parents. Seizures occured in the form of alteration in level of conciousness with tonic eye deviations to the left. On a few occasions, she lost body tone and became hypotonic to atonic. Between ictal episodes, the patient appears to be normal.
A biopsy of the brain tumor was performed in this case to elucidate tumor type ( Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumor). Resection was not a therapeutic alternative due to location of the tumor involving the primary somatosensory cortex. Management of seizures will be attempted with Keppra, an anti-convulsant.

The dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET) is an uncommon lesion characterized by a heterogeneous population of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendroglia-like cells. It is a benign, supratentorial tumor that is almost always associated with partial complex seizures. Mean age of onset of symptoms is nine years and range between 1-19 years of age. The prognosis for patients with DNET is excellent with 70-81% of patients seizure-free following surgery. Surgical resection is curative.
