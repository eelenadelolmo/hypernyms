Radiograph #1 is a supine view of an air contrast BE showing an extrinsic filling defect of the caecum at terminal ileum (TI), with a nodular mucosal pattern. The TI has a severely narrowed lumen which can accommodate only a thin stream of barium; this is commonly referred to as radiographic "string sign". Radiographs #2&3 are cone down views of TI to highlight the above findings.

Ulcerative Colitis

22yo caucasian male C/O moderate intermittent colicky abdominal pain, last episode was approx. one month ago at the time this outpatient study was ordered. The patient has undergone I&D of perirectal abscesses on two occasions.  The patient was diagnosed as having Crohn's disease two years ago when he underwent appendectomy.
This patient presents with the classic appearance of Crohn's disease: a patient in his/her twenties or thirties with the initial focus of disease in the terminal ileum. Characteristic of Crohn's disease is full thickness involvement of the bowel wall with inflammation and subsequent fibrosis. As the disease progresses, the bowel becomes more fibrotic and stenotic with loss of its normal contour, leading to a thick, featureless appearance of the bowel. The stenotic areas measure between 0.5 and 20 cm in length and are the basis for the string sign as the barium thins to go through the narrow stenotic areas. Though it is frequently seen in Crohn's disease, string sign is subject to question in this disease process since many of these string areas represent spasm of the bowel and can be seen to reopen on fluoroscopy. In this particular patient, the thin string at the terminal ileum (TI) was not noted to change throughout the exam. Another method of discerning areas of stenosis from areas of spasm is the finding of prestenotic dilatation, indicating that the narrowing has been present for a long time, thus indicating stenosis.
Radiographic findings of Crohn's include affected areas interspersed with areas of normal bowel (skip lesions), cobblestone appearance of bowel mucosa (due to ulceration), stenosis, prestenotic dilatation, thick bowel folds with loops of bowel that appear widely separated from one another, fistulae, sinuses, abscesses, pseudodiverticulae and aphthous ulcers. The disease is inevitably worse than it appears radiographically.
Presentation is variable between acute and chronic. It is not uncommon for patients to present with perirectal abscess prior to their presentation with symptoms of Crohn's. The acute presentation of Crohn's very closely resembles acute appendicitis with RLQ pain and peritoneal signs, possibly a palpable mass in the RLQ, and there may be air-fluid levels.

in the small bowel on abdominal films. As noted in this patient's history, the dx of Crohn's was made at the time of appendectomy and it is entirely possible that his symptoms at the time were a result of acute Crohn's rather than typical appendicitis. The most common presentation for Crohn's is probably a subacute onset with fever, malaise, diarrhea, colicky abdominal pain and a tender RLQ mass. Chronic Crohn's presents with more diffuse abdominal pain and tenderness, abscess formation, possible radiographic evidence of thickened bowel loops, sinuses, or any of the findings noted above.
Crohn's disease falls within the larger category of inflammatory bowel disease and must be distinguished from the other major condition in this category with which it could be confused, namely ulcerative colitis. Some distinguishing features of Crohn's and UC are as follows:

Crohn's	                                           UC
Entire bowel wall(depth)	           Mucosal
Skip lesions	                           Continuous
Rectal involvement	(Rare)	           Frequent            Fibrosis (Frequent)                           Seldom
Fistulae/sinuses (Common)	           Rare	                                      

In up to 30% of Crohn's cases the disease may involve only the large bowel, which increases the importance of differentiating it from UC.

Summary: Crohn's disease is classically described as a condition affecting the small bowel, initiating at the TI, predominating in whites in their 20s or 30s, affecting males and females equally. Cases have been described affecting people of all ages as well as affecting any portion of the alimentary tract from esophagus to rectum.
