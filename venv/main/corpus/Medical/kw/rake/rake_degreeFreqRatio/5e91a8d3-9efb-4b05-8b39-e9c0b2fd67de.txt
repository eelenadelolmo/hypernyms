Normal physical examination with the following laboratory values (range in parentheses represent normal ranges): 

HgA1C 7.9 (4.1-6.5)
Fasting glucose 157 (70-99)
AST 40 (9-26)
ALT 47 (8-30)
Cholesterol 203 (<200)
Triglycerides 189 (<150)
GGT 84 (8-40)
Treatment consists of removal of the toxic agent and/or correction of the metabolic abnormality when possible.
This longitudinal view of the right abdomen provides a comparison between the liver and the right kidney to evaluate for tissue echogenicity. There is increased echogenicity of the liver parenchyma compared with the adjacent renal cortex which is greater than the normal differential.
Fatty infiltration of the liver
Increased echogenicity of the liver beyond that of normal can be due to fatty infiltration (increased intracellular deposition of triglycerides within hepatocytes) from diabetes, alcohol abuse, cholesterol-lowering medications, toxins, malnutrician, corticosteroids, and some chemotherapeutic agents.
52 year old man with elevated transaminases.
The liver is normally more echogenic than the kidney although a marked difference is abnormal and may be caused by fatty infiltration. The pancreas should normally be more echogenic than the liver--the reversal of this finding would also suggest fatty infiltration. Additional findings of fatty infiltration might also include the presence of a finer and more homogeneous liver echotexture than normal.
