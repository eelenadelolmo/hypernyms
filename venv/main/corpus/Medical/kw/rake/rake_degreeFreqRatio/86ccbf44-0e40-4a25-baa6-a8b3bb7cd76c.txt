This 28 year old man who just returned from deployment to the Middle East yesterday and developed an extremely pruritic rash within the last 24 hours. It started in his groin and has spread up to his axilla and down both thighs. 

Medications: 
1. Doxycycline 100mg daily for malaria prophylaxis for the last 6 months. 
2. Has not started primaquin yet.
3. Benadryl has dulled his pruritus slightly.

He adamantly denies going out in the sun over the past few days as he is aware of light sensitivity with doxycycline.  He has started no new medications or supplements or over the counter medications  other than Benadryl which he started after the rash began.
The photos demonstrate that the patient has symmetric confluent erythematous patches extending from the thighs proximally along his flanks up to his axillae. This confluent blanching erythema brings to mind three primary categories for the differential diagnosis: external factors such as heat or a contactant/irritant, a drug reaction, or a viral exanthem.  

A heat rash is favored given the history of recent travel from the Middle East, likely in a hot environment with body armor and heavy clothing (uniform), and prolonged sitting.

The complaint of pruritus is more common in a heat rash or a contact/irritant dermatitis.  Early in their course Erythema Multiforme or Stevens Johnsons Syndrome can present as marked erythema, but the rapidly exfolliate and are "painful" rather than "pruritic."

In this case, stopping the doxycycline is appropriate.   However, this distribution is not photodistributed as is common for the rash associated with doxycycline.

Continuing with antihistamines (zyrtec during the day and Benadryl at night) will provide symptomatic relief.  This can be supplemented with a medium potency topical steroid such as triaminolonoe 0.1% ointment.
