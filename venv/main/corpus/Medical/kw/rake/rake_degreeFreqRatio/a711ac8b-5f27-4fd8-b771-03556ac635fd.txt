PE was remarkable for enlarged, painless, smooth thyroid gland without palpable nodules and normal DTRs.  Patient had mildly coarse facial features (including brow, jaw, and nose).  No visual field defects. Remainder of physical exam normal.

Serum fT4, total T3, and TSH concentrations were all elevated:
Free T4 : 3.1	Total T3 : 427	TSH : 5.58	

HGH : 1.3 	IGF-1 : 362	alpha subunit : 3.6	
Oral glucose tolerance test failed to suppress GH suggesting unregulated secretion of GH. 

ACTH, Prolactin, FSH, and LH all within normal limits
Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for pituitary adenomas, however, somatostatin analogs can be used to effectively reduce autonomous secretion of pituitary hormones, as well decrease the size of the adenomas by approximately 50%.  Due to the invasive nature of this macroadenoma, octreotide therapy was initiated in this patient to facilitate a more optimal surgical outcome.
MRI examination of the sella revealed a 2.6x1.5cm enhancing intrasellar mass encasing the left internal carotid artery and expanding the posterior sella wall.  In-111-Octreotide scan showed increase uptake in the intrasellar mass.  

NOTE: An increased uptake of octreotide, a somatostatin analog that is a marker of neuroendocrine neoplasms, was also noted in the thyroid gland.  This was due to a coincident papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Pituitary macroadenoma secreting TSH and GH
• Pituitary macroadenoma 
• Craniopharyngioma 
• Meningioma 
• Aneurysm 
• Rathke cleft cyst
• Metastatic Disease
55-year-old Caucasian female presents with 3-week history of left neck mass.  Also reports 20lb weight loss over 3-month period and onset of new headache over prior 3 weeks associated with nausea, emesis, and olfactory hypersensitivity.  No visual changes were noted.
TSH-secreting adenomas represent a small percentage of pituitary adenomas, and those that co-secrete GH are even more rare, with fewer than 55 reported in the medical literature.  The elevated thyroid hormone and growth hormone levels were likely contributing to the patient’s weight loss, coarse facial features, and thyroid goiter, and the patient’s headaches were due to mass effect from the compression of the optic chiasm.  

While surgical resection remains the treatment of choice for pituitary adenomas, studies have demonstrated that somatostatin analogs can effectively reduce autonomous secretion of pituitary hormones, as well decrease the size of the adenomas by approximately 50%.  Due to the invasive nature of this macroadenoma, as evidenced by the encasement of the left internal carotid artery, the neoplasm was not resectable at this time.   Therefore, the patient was started on octreotide therapy in order to shrink the size of the neoplasm and facilitate a more optimal surgical outcome.
