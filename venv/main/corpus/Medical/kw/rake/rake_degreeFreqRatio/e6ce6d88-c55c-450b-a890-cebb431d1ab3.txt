Conservative
Appropriate measures for complications such as infection, obstruction and calculi.
Vacant left renal fossa
Ectopic pelvic kidney/Crossed Ectopia
Blood supply via left common iliac
Nonrotation (anteriorly positioned renal pelvis)
Bladder filling defect
Renal Ectopia-Crossed Unfused/Separate
Renal Ectopia
Hypermobile Kidney
Displacement via diaphragmatic herniation.
Hematuria
Renal Ectopia-Crossed
The ectopic kidney occupies the opposite side of midline from ureteral orifice and is inferior to the normal kidney.  Although crossed fusion is more common, in this case the kidneys are separate.
Other associations include obstruction, urolithiasis, infection, reflux, hypospadia, cryptorchidism, and urethral valves as well as multicystic dysplastic kidney
