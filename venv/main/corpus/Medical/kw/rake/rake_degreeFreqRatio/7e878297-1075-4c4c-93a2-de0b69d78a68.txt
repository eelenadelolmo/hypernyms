Lipid signal mass adjacent to the inferior colliculus on the left.
Intracranial Lipoma
• Dermoid cyst
• Teratoma
• Lipoma
• Pantopaque
Twelve y.o. girl with chronic headaches.
R/O possible venous sinus thrombosis.
In a small lesion, it may be difficult to distinguish a dermoid inclusion cyst from a lipoma.  Both can show T1 shortening (bright on T1W) and both may have a chemical shift artifact.  Both are benign.
