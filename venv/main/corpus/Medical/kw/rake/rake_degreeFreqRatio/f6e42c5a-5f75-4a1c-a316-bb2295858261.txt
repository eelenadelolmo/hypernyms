Fig 1. Non-contrasted axial CT showing mass involving medial aspect of right orbit.

Fig 2. Contrasted coronal CT showing mass involving medial aspect of right orbit including medial rectus muscle.

Fig 3. Histological section showing the neoplasm to be composed of lobules of uniform cells with eosinophilic granular cytoplasm and small oval vesicular to pycnotic nuclei.

Fig 4. The neoplastic cells are stained red with the periodic acid Schiff (PAS) reaction.

Fig 5. The neoplastic cells are stained by an immunoperoxidase technique for S-100.
