Thicken gall bladder wall with no stones.  No intrahepatic or extrahepatic duct dilation or pericholecystic fluid.  Sonographic Murphy’s positive.  HIDA showed no uptake in gallbladder
acalculous acute cholecystitis
Wall thickening differential includes acute cholecystitis, ascities, heart failure, and hypoalbuminemia.  HIDA false positive can be seen in patients with hyperalimentation, severe illness, and hepatocellular dysfunction.
57 y/o male with right upper quadrant pain and history of spine surgery and opioid use.
Acute cholecystitis is associated with cholelithiasis in about 90-95% of the cases.  Acalculous cholecystitis is typically seen in the setting of ICU patients with chronic severe disease.   However, a small group of patients present with acalculous cholecystitis from the outpatient setting.  This group  includes children and patients who have a history of prolong fasting, diabetes or opioid use.  Cholecystitis is rare in children but up to 50% of the cases are of acalculous.  Biliary stasis, ischemia, inflammation and trauma are thought to contribute to these cases.

Treatment is surgery, which occurred in this case.  Pathology confirmed diagnosis
