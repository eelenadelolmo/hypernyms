Vitals:
• HR: 164bpm
• RR: 28
• Heart rate normal
• regular rhythm
• heart sounds normal
• nasal congestion
• dyspnea
• fever
surgical correction
• double aortic arch creating complete vascular ring with right arch dominance measuring 7mm in diameter and left arch measuring 5mm in diameter
• right arch ascends 6mm higher than left
• right carotid and subclavian aa arise from right arch and left carotid and subclavian aa arise from left arch.
• trachea and esophagus are constrained; maximum constraint by vascular ring results in trachea with reduced diameter from 4.5mm to 2mm and a completely collapsed esophagus
• small azygous lobe
• right middle lobe consolidation
Double aortic arch
• tracheoesophageal fistula/esophageal atresia
• double aortic arch-vascular ring
Patient is a 20-month old infant girl with a history of gagging while eating solid foods and cyanotic spells. There is no significant past medical history.
