Neurosurgical consultation; the aneurysm was subsequently coiled by neurointerventional radiology.
Head CT reveals near 2cm hyperdense mass adjacent to right MCA.  On follow-up MRI, the mass has dramatic pulsation artifact, has crescentic internal T2 hypointensity, and does fill with contrast on enhanced T1W images.  Subsequent angiogram demonstrates an enhancing saccular right MCA aneurysm
Cerebral Aneurysm
