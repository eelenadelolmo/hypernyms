Patient asymptomatic at the time of the most recent exam.
Treatment options are being considered at this time.
In the initial CT image, a very large soft tissue mass is seen in the anterior abdomen, growing under surgical mesh at the site of previous surgical intervention.  A CT scan 7 months later is normal.  Six months later, a new soft tissue mass is seen arising in the right rectus abdominis.  The left rectus abdominis is also expanded in the final image, indicating a probable new mass as well.
Desmoid tumor
Desmoid tumor
Soft tissue Sarcoma
Metastatic neoplasm
Rectus sheath hematoma
17 year old male with history of colonic adenomatous polyposis syndrome and repeated abdominal surgeries for recurrent abdominal masses.
These images point out one of the problems of desmoid tumors - a frequent recurrence rate.
