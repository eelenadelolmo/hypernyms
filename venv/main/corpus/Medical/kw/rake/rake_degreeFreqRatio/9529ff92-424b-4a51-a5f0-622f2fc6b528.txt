The patient was found to have an antalgic gait.  He had no neurologic symptoms and had limited mobility secondary to a mass on his right hip.  His right hip range of motion was from 90 degrees of flexion to 7 degrees of flexion.  His external rotation was approximately 15 degrees, and internal rotation was 30 degrees.
Surgery to remove the HO was conducted six months from the time of injury.  The eight centimeter by eight centimeter mass was found to lay superficial to the external short external rotators.  Upon removal of the mass, the patient’s hip range of motion was from 120 degrees of hip flexion and to 20 degrees of extension.  His external rotation improved to approximately 50 degrees, with an internal rotation of 30 degrees.  Six months post-surgery, the patient has regained his mobility and the ability to run without significant difficulty.
Both CT and x-ray show a calcified mass posterior to the acetabulum and femur.

A 39 year-old man was injured in a gunfight.  The patient suffered a GSW to the right buttock that exited the scrotum.  The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, found to be negative, and a transscrotal exploration that found injury to the bladder and urethra.  A probing of the right hip wound revealed that the injury went posterior to the femur and did not invade the capsule.  Approximately four months post-injury, the patient reported a progressive limiting of his hip range of motion and inability to perform activities of daily living.
Cases of HO have been reported after lateral hip soft tissue trauma, with ectopic/heterotopic ossification found in areas of hematoma or where soft tissue surgical trauma has occurred.(3-5)  A plausible explanation for this unusual case of HO involving a gunshot wound is likely the same as occurs in any soft tissue trauma.  The localized trauma induces metaplastic change of multipotent connective tissue cells into osteogenic cells which then lay down stroma and calcify.(9)
