Texto: 
The patient had shoddy cervical/inguinal lymph nodes, course breath sounds  on the right, tachycardia at 170 bpm .  Initial labs showed a wbc of 20, ESR of 52, CRP 5.4 and platelets of 694
Patientâ€™s symptoms resolved with initiation of Amphotericin B and discharged with Voriconazole.
Chest x-ray showed diffuse, bilateral nodular infiltrates.  

CT scan showed miliary pattern consistent with infectious or metastatic disease process and hilar lymphadenopathy.
Pulmonary Aspergillosis
(1)  military tuberculosis
(2)  varicella pneumonia
(3)  lymphoma
Patient is a 2 ? year old girl with a history of fever of no clear origin for over 2 weeks.  Her temperature has been rising up to  103  F with additional symptoms of decreased appetite, occasional cough and diarrhea.  She has lost 2 pounds over this time period.
This case is unique because of lack of risk factors the patient has to develop pulmonary aspergillosis.  There is no known history of underlying malignancy or immunosuppression.  T
