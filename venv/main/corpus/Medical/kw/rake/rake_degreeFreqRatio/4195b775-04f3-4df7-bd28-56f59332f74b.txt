Texto: 
Patient  has tenderness to palpation and diffuse swelling at the posteriolateral aspect of right ankle. Pain is worsened with manual compression of distal right leg.  Lab tests within normal limits.
Follow-up plain films several weeks later reveal a lucent fracture line with extensive surrounding callous formation at the fracture site in the distal fibula. 

There is also a horizontal sclerotic line in the distal tibia - a second stress fracture.

Patient was conservatively managed with a walking cast for 3 weeks and cessation from all athletic activity for 8 weeks.

Follow-up radiographs were used to evaluate healing.
Plain film: AP view of right ankle demonstrates a subtle sclerotic line that runs perpendicular to the long axis of the distal fibula, just superior to lateral malleolous.
Stress Fracture of the Distal Fibula and Tibia
infection, neoplasm, stress fracture, complete fracture
30 year old female long distance runner, presents with right ankle pain of several weeks duration.
