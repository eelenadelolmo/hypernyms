Aphasia and dysarthria
Radiation therapy as these tumors are typically very sensitive to radiation therapy.
Enhancing mass involving left orbit, middle cranial fossa, maxillary sinus, infratemporal fossa and cavernous sinus.
Primary CNS lymphoma
Aggressive neoplasm:
1. Lymphoma, primary CNS or metastatic to brain
2. Sarcoma, primary or metastatic
Persistent headache for eight weeks and mental status changes.
This case demonstrates CNS lymphoma's ability to spread along neural routes and brain surface as well as invade the brain parenchyma.
