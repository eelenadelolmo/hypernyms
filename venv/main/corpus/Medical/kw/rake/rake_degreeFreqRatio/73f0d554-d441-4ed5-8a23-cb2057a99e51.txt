• Medial orbital wall fracture on left ("blow-out fracture")
- herniation of medal rectus muscle into ethmoid sinus
• Increased signal intensity in CSF on Flair images
• Fluid/debris level lateral ventricle
• Enhancement over cerebral convexities left > right.
Acute bacterial meningitis
• Viral Meningitis
• Leptomeningeal tumor spread ("carcinomatous meningitis")
• Subarachnoid hemorrhage
