non-focal neurologic examination.
No treatment. Being followed by neurosurgery with serial examinations.

Colloid cyst.
Colloid cyst.
Although other lesions can occur in this region such as ependymoma, subependymoma, giant cell astrocytoma and central neurocytoma,the imaging findings are characteristic for a colloid cyst.
29 year old female with worsening headaches.
The diagnosis of colloid cyst was made based on the imaging characteristics. The patient and neurosurgeon have elected conservative management at this time as her headaches have resolved and she has no evidence of ventricular obstruction currently.
