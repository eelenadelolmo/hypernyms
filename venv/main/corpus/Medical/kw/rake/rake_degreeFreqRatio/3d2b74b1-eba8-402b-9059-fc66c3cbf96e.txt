Therapeutic cystoscopy with transurethral incision of the posterior urethral valves is performed.
Voiding Cystourethrography (VCUG): Dilated posterior urethra proximal to the valve narrowing.  The bladder is irregular and trabeculated with high grade vesicoureteral reflux.
Posterior Urethral Valves
Urethral stricture
Urethral atresia
Persistent cloaca
Antenatal Hydronephrosis
Urinary Tract Infection
4 day old infant with a history of pyelectasis on obstetric sonogram.
Posterior urethral valves are the most common cause of lower urinary tract obstruction.  Other causes include urethral atresia, urethral stricture, and persistent cloaca.  Posterior urethral valves may cause total, intermittent, or partial obstruction.  As in this case, this disorder is exclusively seen in males.  The back pressure from the urethral obstruction often causes a dilated urinary bladder, dilated proximal urethra, bladder wall thickening (>2 mm), bilateral hydroureters, and hydronephrosis.  If the obstruction is long standing, renal parenchymal fibrosis and dysplasia will develop, as in this case.  There is often severe oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, and compression deformities as well.
