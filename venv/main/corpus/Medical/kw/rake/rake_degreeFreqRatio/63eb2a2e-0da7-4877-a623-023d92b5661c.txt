PA and Lateral radiograph of a properly positioned Amplatzer ASD Occluder. The PA radiograph demonstrates a single disk with two metallic dots (corresponding to the narrow waist of the device). The lateral radiograph demonstrates proper positioning of two flat disks. The left atrial disk appears larger than the right atrial disk. Again, the metallic waist dots are visualized.
