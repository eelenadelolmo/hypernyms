Texto: 
N/A
Patient is being followed by neurosurgery for tumor debulking at the level of T3/T4.
Plain radiographs:

Thoracic spine:  AP radiograph of the thoracic spine demonstrates abnormality of the left T4 pedicle with loss of the cortical margin and decreased mineralization.

Additionally, there is lucency of the T11 spinous process.

Lumbar spine:  Decreased mineralization of the right side of L3 with lucency of the right pedicle and loss of the cortical margin on the right.
------------------------------------------------
CT:
The level of T4 demonstrates lytic destruction of the left pedicle, base of the spinous process, and the majority of the transverse process.  A soft tissue mass is present in this region, with mass effect into the central canal - causing severe central stenosis and impingement on the spinal cord.

The soft tissue mass extends laterally, involving the adjacent fourth rib and subpleural space.
Hepatocellular carcinoma and bone metastasis.
Metastatic disease
38 year old Nigerian male with back pain and history of hepatocelluar carcinoma.
The findings are subtle examples for metastatic disease on plain radiographs.  It is important in the routine search pattern to insure the integrity of the pedicles and spinous processes, as well as the cortical margins of the vertebral bodies, to detect radiographic evidence of metastatic disease in setting of a patient with a known malignancy.
