Texto: 
Chemotherapy and radiation
Subtotal destruction of the right ischium.
Skeletal metastasis.
Skeletal metastasis
Primary bone tumor (e.g. lymphoma)
Infection
57 year old male has right hip pain.
Given the relative frequency, metastatic lesion is most likely.  The patient had no known malignancy at the time of this study.
Primary aggressive tumor of bone is possible, although less likely given relative frequency.
Infection is possible, although would expect more perilesional osteoporosis and joint involvement.
