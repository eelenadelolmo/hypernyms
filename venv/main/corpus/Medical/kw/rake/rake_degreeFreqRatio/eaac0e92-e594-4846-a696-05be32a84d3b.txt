Texto: 
Edematous nasal tip with erythema and TTP. Left peri-orbital edema/ecchymosis.
Elevated WBCs with left shift.
Continued drainiage.
IV antibiotics.
Repair of concomitant left orbital floor fracture.
Soft tissue nasal tip subcutaneous fluid collection with mildly-enhanced, slightly irregular rim.
Subcutaneous Abscess of nasal tip
Hematoma.
Phlegmon, subcutaneous.
Vascular or lymphatic malformation
Known alcoholic with recent blunt facial trauma, nasal pain, left peri-orbital ecchymosis and fever.
Unusual location for SQ abscess, considering the extensive blood supply to this area.The patient's pre-traumatic history of alcoholism and poor nutrition likely contributed to this picture, along with the delayed presentation to the ER (about 2 weeks). Danger of this infection, of course, is the lack of valves in the veins, which drain directly into the cavernous sinus and can result in a cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis.
