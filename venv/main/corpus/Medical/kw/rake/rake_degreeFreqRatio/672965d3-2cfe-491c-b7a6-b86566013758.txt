Immediate cessation of weight bearing and orthopaedic referral.
Frontal radiographs of the pelvis and right hip as well as a frog-leg lateral radiograph of the right hip demonstrate abnormal linear sclerosis extending to the inferior mid portion of the right femoral neck as well as a subtle cortical break through at the superior midportion of the right femoral neck.  These findings are consistent with a non-displaced completed right femoral neck stress fracture.
Femoral Neck Stress Fractures
Completed stress fracture
Long-standing right hip pain during advanced course (military) training.
Many young men and women undergoing military training are at increased risk for stress-type injuries including fractures.  Prompt diagnosis and intervention is key to proper treatment.  A low threshold should exist for utilizing all modalities available (radiographs, bone scan, and MRI) to diagnose these injuries.
