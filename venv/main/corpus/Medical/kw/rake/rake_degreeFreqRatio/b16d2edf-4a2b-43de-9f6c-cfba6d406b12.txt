Texto: 
Snuffbox tenderness noted, as well as pain with volar flexion.
Patient to be seen by orthopedics.
The oblique radiograph demonstrates a faint lucency in the distal pole of the scaphoid.  The MRI images demonstrate a clear fracture of the distal scaphoid, with fragmentation and some ulnar displacement.  The waist and proximal pole of the scaphoid are within normal limits.
Scaphoid Fracture
Scaphoid fracture, distal pole
33 year old male fell on outstretched hand.  Although initial radiographs were read as suspicious but not definitive for scaphoid fracture, the patient was not re-imaged as recommended.  Patient underwent physical therapy for 8 months prior to obtaining an MRI examination.
