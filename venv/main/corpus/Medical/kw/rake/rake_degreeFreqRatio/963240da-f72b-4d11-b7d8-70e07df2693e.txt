Texto: 
Normal breast exam with no palpable abnormalities or skin changes.
This is a benign condition requiring no further treatment.  The patient should continue routine screening mammography.
Mammography:  Standard CC and MLO views of the breasts demonstrate a partially circumscribed and partially obscured 3 cm hyperdense mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast.  There are no suspicious clusters of calcifications.

Right Breast Ultrasound:  There is a 3.6 x 1.0 x 2.2 cm solid and cystic mass with partially ill defined margins within the upper outer quadrant of the right breast along the 09:30 radial and approximately 7 cm from the nipple.  The lesion has internal vascularity.  The cystic portions of the lesion have increased through transmission.
Sclerosing Adenosis
Infiltrating ductal carcinoma
Infiltrating lobular carcinoma
Tubular carcinoma
Ductal carcinoma in situ
Postoperative scar
Radial scar
Fat necrosis
Metastatic disease
Infection such as Tuberculosis.
The patient has no family history of breast cancer and presented for annual routine screening mammography.
Mammography can not readily distinguish sclerosing adenosis from a malignant process.  Biopsy is typically required to confirm this diagnosis.
