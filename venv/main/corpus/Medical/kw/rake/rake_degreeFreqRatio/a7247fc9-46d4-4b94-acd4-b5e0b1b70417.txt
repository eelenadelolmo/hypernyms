1.  Flow images were taken of the lower extremity, the area of pain.  Flow images were normal.

2.  Whole body blood pool images of the body demonstrate focal increased uptake in the proximal half of the right clavicle.

3.  Delayed images demonstrate increased uptake in the entire right clavicle, greatest in the proximal third.

4.  MRI which demonstrates intermediate to low signal on T1, increased signal on T2 within the proximal clavicle and enhancement in the same region.  There was a thickened cortex with surrounding granulation tissue.
T-99m HDP and Subacute Osteomyelitis
Without the history of previous infection, differential considerations (assuming the lesion would be ‚Äúhot‚Äù on three phases include:  
osteomyelitis
fracture
arthritis ‚Äì gout, osteoarthritis, or rheumatoid
healing osteonecrosis
Charcot joint
osteotomy
reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome
Malignant neoplasms 

Most of these are excluded by history, location, and radiographic findings.  Malignant neoplasms may also demonstrate hyperemia, however, this is often involves the entire extremity.
11 y.o. female with suspected recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis.
The typical appearance of osteomyelitis on a three-phase scan is early hyperemia with focal or possibly diffuse uptake on blood pool images and progressive accumulation in the involved bone on delayed imaging.  This study was at least two phase positive.  The bloof flow images were taken of the legs because the patient was complaining of leg pain the day of the study.

Previous imaging studies assisted in the diagnosis.  The patient already had a history or osteomyelitis and the bone scan was ordered to rule out polyostotic involvement.
