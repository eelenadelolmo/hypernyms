Texto: 
Conservative treatment initially, to be followed by surgery if the symptoms fail to remit.
Sagittal and axial T2 images reveal asymmetric diskovertebral degenerative changes at L5-S1, with disk dessication and narrowing at this level.  More significantly, there is a large left paramedian disk extrusion at this level, measuring 2.3cm cc x 1.7cm transverse x 1.2cm AP, which displaces the left S1 nerve root posteriorly. The extruded disk results in moderate left neural foraminal stenosis.
Intervertebral Disk Herniation
47 yo male with left buttock pain radiating to the back of his left leg.
