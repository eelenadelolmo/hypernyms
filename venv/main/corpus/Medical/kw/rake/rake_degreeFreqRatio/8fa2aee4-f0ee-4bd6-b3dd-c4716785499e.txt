22 year old woman with 6 week history of progressively more severe headaches and a gait ataxia.
Most medullobastomas in adults occur in the lateral cerebellum rather than the usual midline location in children.  Adults may also have variant subtypes of cerebellar PNET, including "Desmoplastic Medulloblastoma" - which is also more commonly lateral in the hemisphere, rather than midline in the vermis.
