Texto: 
Moderate point tenderness over the head of the left second metatarsal.
Treatment options for Freiberg's infraction vary based upon the level of collapse and include support with padding or orthotics, casting (used in the early stages to decrease the tendency of the distal bone to collapse), and steroid injections.

This patient was under treatment with conservative measures as of this writing.
Three views of the left foot demonstrate flattening of the second metatarsal head with associated subchondral lucency and subchondral sclerosis.  The remaining bones, joints, and soft tissues are unremarkable.
