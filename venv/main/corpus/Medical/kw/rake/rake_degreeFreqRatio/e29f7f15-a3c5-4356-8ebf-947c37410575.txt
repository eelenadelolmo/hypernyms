No physical exam findings
Laboratory workup was unrevealing
Surgical resection
Axial CT images demonstrate an enhancing mass arising from the tail of the pancreas. Octreotide scan images reveal radiotracer accumulation within this mass.
Pancreatic Endocrine Neoplasm
Endocrine Neoplasm
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma
Metastatic disease

The octreotide scan confirms the diagnosis of endocrine neoplasm.
66 year old asymptomatic male presents with elevated transaminases.
In this particular case, there was no predominant hormone production from the mass. It contained mixed APUD cells however staining for gastrin, insulin, and glucagon.
