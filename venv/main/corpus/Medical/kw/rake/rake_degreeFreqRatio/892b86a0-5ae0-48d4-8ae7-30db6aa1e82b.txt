Pain at right hip joint.
None
Radiographs of pelvis and right hip demonstrate small osteophyte formation at the lateral right acetabular rim consistent with mild osteoarthritis. Also seen is a  2 X 3 cm well circumscribed non-expansile central metaphyseal bony lesion with a narrow zone of transition, and spiculated "thorny" margin, as typically seen in a bone island.  This may represent an enostosis (bone island)with central lucency
