Texto: 
2+ bilateral LE edema
Bilateral lower lung field crackles
Restarted diuretic
â€¢ Patchy opacities at the lung bases bilaterally, most likely due 
atelectasis.  
 
â€¢ Pulmonary venous congestion and pulmonary edema.
 
â€¢ Stable cardiomegaly and postoperative changes of the chest to include mechanical aortic and mitral valve rings.
CHF exacerbation
72 y/o woman, well known to the cardiology clinic, presenting for outpatient referral from her hematologist over concerns for increased LE swelling, exertional dyspnea and weight gain in the setting of no diuretic use for the past 2-3 weeks.
Note placement and appearance of mechanical valves, and compare to porcine valves.
