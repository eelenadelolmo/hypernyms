No clinical signs of respiratory distress.  Normal lung sounds to auscultation without stridor or wheezing.  No cyanosis.  Normal pulse oximetry.
Observation of an asymptomatic patient for 24 hours to see if the coin will pass spontaneously is acceptable.  When symptomatic, or when the coin fails to pass spontaneously, endoscopy is indicated to manually remove the coin and to visualize the esophageal mucosa to rule out associated injury.  Alternatively a foley catheter can be passed distal to the coin (preferably under fluoroscopic guidance), inflated, and then retracted to recover the coin.  When this method is utilized it is wise to have the patient in a "head down" or Trendelenberg position to minimize the risk of subsequent aspiration of the coin as it is removed.
Plain radiographs demonstrate a metallic disc-shaped object oriented in the coronal plane within the proximal esophagus at the level of the thoracic inlet.  There is no evidence of air trapping or obstruction.
