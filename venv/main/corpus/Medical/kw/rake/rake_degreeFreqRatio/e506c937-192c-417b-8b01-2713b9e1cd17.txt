On physical examination, full extension of elbow was noted to cause worsening of pain and a very small joint effusion was suspected on palpation
Often orthopedic surgeons will elect to arthroscopically remove enlarged synovial folds with the goal of eliminating symptoms and preventing future recurrence.  Surgical intervention is the definitive treatment of choice.
There were no positive radiographic findings on plain Xray.  MRI revealed thickened posterolateral plica with a component interposed between the posterior capitellum and radial head with marrow edema on both sides of the articulation
synovial fold syndrome of the elbow
lateral epicondylitis (aka tennis elbow)
loose bodies
osteoarthritis
and snapping triceps tendon
A 17 year old female cheerleader reports experiencing acute left elbow pain while performing gymnastics maneuvers during recent practice sessions.  The patient describes pain along the lateral aspect of the elbow and a sensation of “catching” during range of motion exercises.
