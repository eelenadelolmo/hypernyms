Entrance and exit wound in right shoulder. Also entrance wound in Right EAM. Not able to hear out of right ear.
Since the patient was stable without clinically evident manifestations of the injury, it was decided to leave the bullet in the clivus and closely follow the individual.
Metallic fragments from projectile in right temporal bone demonstrating ballistic tract. The bullet entered the external auditory canal, penetrated the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and stopped in the clivus. 

The bullet appears to have tumbled from when it entered the EAM to lodging into the clivus.
Bullet to the clivus.
Bullet to the clivus.
A male soldier was shot in the right shoulder while on security detail in Iraq.
Several points of interest this case demonstrates are the following: the even number rule (see factoid), tumbling bullet, projectile in unexpected location (shot in shoulder, however, bullet ended up in clivus),  and the size of the round (thought to be AK-47, however, not determined in this case).

When a bullet has more mass at its proximal end due to distal tapering, there is a tendency for tumbling 180°.  This tendency frequently results in bullets seen on radiographs pointing toward their direction of travel and entrance wound.


This case demonstrates an unusual path bringing up another unintuitive situation called bullet embolism, which is a rare but well documented phenomenon.  With bullet embolism, the bullet travels through vascular channels; however, in our patient, the bullet traveled through both an air-filled channel (the external auditory canal) and a vascular channel (the petrous carotid canal). Although this case does not represent bullet embolism by definition, its unusual path brings up another reason to use the even number rule (see factoid).
