Non-contributory.
Spontaneous resorption of intraperitoneal air usually requires no direct intervention or followup.
Free air noted under the right hemidiaphragm and anterior subcutaneous air seen on the lateral view.  Also noted is mild blunting of both costophrenic angles, likely representing either atelectasis or sympathetic pleural effusions.
Pneumoperitoneum
Pneumoperitoneum
Ruptured abdominal viscus
Post operative air
Recent surgical removal of abdominal mass.
If this patient did not have a recent surgical history, the presence of free intraperitoneal air would be an ominous sign suggestive of a perforated viscus.  This would then become a surgical urgency or emergency.
