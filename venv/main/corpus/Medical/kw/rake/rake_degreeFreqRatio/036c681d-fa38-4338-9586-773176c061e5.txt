Gross blood in stool
Iron Deficiency
Resection of sigmoid colon
Solid column enema (gastrografin) shows a fairly long segment smooth narrowing within the proximal to mid sigmoid colon.

Contrast enhanced CT shows circumferential wall thickening in the same location, with associated infiltration of the subjacent mesenteric fat ("dirty fat" sign).
Invasive Colon Cancer,  moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma
Colon cancer until proven otherwise.
Less likely:
lymphoma
metastatic disease
amebiasis
inflammatory stricture
61 y.o. man with bright red blood per rectum (hematochezia) and iron deficiency anemia.
This is a fairly typical "apple core" lesion, caused by infiltration of the bowel wall.  Click here to see the "apple core" from another patient:
