Texto: 
Wedge shaped hyperechoic focus of the right kidney at junction of upper and middle third.
Junctional Parenchymal Defect
Junctional Parenchymal Defect
Angiomyolipoma
Cortical scar
22 year old for right upper qaudrant ultrasound for evaluation of gallstones. This was an incidental finding.
On real time imaging, this defect was noted to communicate with the renal sinus fat, making it most consistent with a junctional parenchymal defect vs AML or cortical scar.
