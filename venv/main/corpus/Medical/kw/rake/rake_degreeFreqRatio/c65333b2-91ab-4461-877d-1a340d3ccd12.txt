Texto: 
Firm, nonmobile right neck mass.
Treatment consist of passive and active stretching and usually resolves spontaneously.  Surgical release may be necessary in some cases as uncorrected rotation can cause permanent fibrosis and craniofacial growth asymmetry.
Ultrasound images of the right neck demonstrates a rounded, heterogeneous mass slightly hyperechoic to muscle within the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
