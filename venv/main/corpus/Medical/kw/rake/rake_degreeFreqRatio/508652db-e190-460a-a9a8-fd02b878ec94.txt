A posteroanterior radiograph of the right wrist shows scapholunate dissociation and narrowing of the radioscaphoid and lunatocapitate articulations.  In more advanced cases (not shown), pancarpal degenerative changes and flattening of the scaphoid and lunate bones may be seen.
SLAC (scapholunate advanced collapse) wrist (i.e., carpal instability).  These radiographic findings are pathognomonic for the diagnosis.
