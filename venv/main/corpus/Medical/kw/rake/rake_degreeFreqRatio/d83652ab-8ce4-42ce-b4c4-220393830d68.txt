Texto: 
Precordial flow murmur
Patient died several weeks later
Cardiac CT images demonstrate a hypervascular mass arising from the free wall of the right atrium; the mass is invading / filling the majority of the right heart chambers.
Angiosarcoma
Primary cardiac neoplasm (Angiosarcoma, MFH, rhabdomyosarcoma);
Metastatic disease;
Invasive lung cancer
Weight loss, shortness of breath, lower extremity edema; echocardiography demonstrated a cardiac "mass"
Cardiac sarcomas are the most common primary malignant tumor of the heart and pericardium. They are rare neoplasms; metastatic disease to the heart is at least 30 times more common.  Angiosarcoma is the most common subtype.  Most cardiac angiosarcomas arise as mural masses in the right atrium and invade adjacent structures.  Treatment options are limited, with surgical resection being the best hope.
