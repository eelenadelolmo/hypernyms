Tenderness over the lower cervical spine.
AP radiograph of the C-spine does not show the so-called "double spinous shadow" sign between C6 and C7, but the lateral radiograph demonstrates a triangular osseous fragment posterior to the C6 spinous process consistent with a clay shoveler's type fracture.
Clay Shoveler's Fracture
>>Spinous process fracture without spinolaminar breach: clay shoveler's type fracture.
>>Spinous process fracture with spinolaminar breach. 
>>Soft tissue calcification/ossification.
>>Absence of fusion of a secondary ossification center
42 year old Asian male with cervical pain for 1 year.  History of MVA in 1999.
The stable more posteriorly, perpendicular oriented spinous process fracture, the so-called clay shoveler’s fracture, should be differentiated from the potentially unstable more anterior, obliquely oriented spinous process fracture that may extend to breach the spinolaminar line.
