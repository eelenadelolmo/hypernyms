Tender abdomen
Microhematuria
Conservative management with hydration and pain control.
Axial CT images with and without contrast demonstrate delayed nephrogram on the left with hydronephrosis. Distally at the left ureterovesical junction, there is a barely visible punctate calcification consistent with a ureterolith.
Nephrolithiasis
Renal Artery Stenosis
Renal Vein Thrombosis
Ureteral Obstruction
23 year old female with history of Crohn's disease presents with non-specific abdominal pain.
