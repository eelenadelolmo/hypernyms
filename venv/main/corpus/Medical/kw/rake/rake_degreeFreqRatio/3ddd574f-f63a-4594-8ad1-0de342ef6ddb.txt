•Right pelvic dysplastic/severely hydronephrotic kidney
•Hydroureter and severe serpentine ectasia of the right ureter
•Non fusion of the mullerian ductal structures
•Uterus didelphys
•Imperforate right vagina
•Hematometrocolpos involving the right uterus, cervix, and proximal vagina
•Hematocrit effect within the lumen of the dilated right mullerian structures
•Patent left vagina
•Normal ovaries
•Normal left collecting system
Uterus didelphys with hematometrocolpos and multicystic dysplastic kidney
On both Emergency Department visits the patient was admitted for suspected appendicitis versus perforated appendix versus tubo-ovarian abscess.
15 year old Hispanic female, G0 P0 with chief complaint of right lower quadrant pain. She complained of intermittent RLQ pain for the past year and a half, with a previous hospital admission 6 months prior for the same symptoms. Pain was worst on the day of present admission, which coincided with the first day of her menstrual period. Patient admits to being sexually active, with occasional condom use, but denies any history of sexually transmitted infection.
The finding of dysplastic kidney is rare.  Usually, renal agenesis is associated with the obstructed moiety of the uterus didelphys.
