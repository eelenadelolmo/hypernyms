normal triple screen
There is severe hydronephrosis noted of the left kidney on axial image.  On sagital imaging of the left kidney, this is seen to primarily only involve the upper portion of the kidney.  Mild pelviectasis is noted on the right, within normal limits (<4mm).
Imaging of the bladder demonstrates an eccentrically located thin wall cyst at the inferior aspect of the bladder along the left lateral posterior wall.
Duplicated Renal Collecting System
Hydronephrosis of the left kidney with a pelvic cyst - possibly ovarian for females or seminial vesicle for males

Duplicated collecting system with ectopic ureterocele

Dilated stomach bubble and inferiorly displaced or incompletely ascended kidney
Uncomplicated pregnancy presenting for second trimester anatomic screening ultrasound
