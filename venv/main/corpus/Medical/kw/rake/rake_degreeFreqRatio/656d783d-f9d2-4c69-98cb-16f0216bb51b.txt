Texto: 
An alert, interactive adolescent. He is afebrile. His pulse is 88, respiratory rate is 18.  The head is normocephalic. He has marked edema of his left eyelid with significant proptosis as well as downward displacement of the left eye orbit. He has soft tissue edema extending onto his forehead without warmth or erythema. He has continuous active drainage from his left naris. His right septum is erythematous but otherwise normal. Mucous membranes are moist.  Tongue has some bluish patchy discoloration which is localized along the lateral edges of his tongue bilaterally, more prominent on the left. 

White blood cell count of 13,700 without a shift to
the left. Hemoglobin is 13.7 gm/dL, platelet count is 132,000. Blood culture no growth after 5 days.
ENT and ID were consulted.  The patient was started on meropenem and vancomycin. Maximize trough vancomycin level to at least 15-20 mcg/mL.  The patient had surgery for drainage of the abscess as well as submission of cultures for bacteria, fungus, and mycobacteria, which were all negative.  He was discharged to complete a four week total course of antibiotic therapy. He was sent home on oral Levofloxacin (100 mg twice a day) as well as Doxycycline (750 mg once daily).
The roof of the left orbit is depressed and there is soft tissue density from the left frontal sinus is causing proptosis and downward displacement of the left globe. There is mass effect on the left superior rectus muscle. This suggests at least some component of orbital involvement.

Potts puffy tumor
This is an 18 year-old who has has a long history of recurrent sinus infections - which tend to
worsen in the winter. Approximately one month ago, he was started on a course of antibiotics for increasing sinus pressure and drainage. He did initially have some improvement; however, once he completed the antibiotics he noted worsening again. He re-sought care in the ED one week ago after he was noted to have eyelid edema. At that time he was started on Bactrim and sent home. Mom felt that there was not significant improvement over the course of the week.  They noted continued worsening of his eyelid edema and some proptosis. They re-sought care and were referred to an ophthalmologist.  

He has a family history of eczema and denies any allergies.  He denied diplopia, but complained of vague eye pain with a mild frontal headache.
This was a case of Potts puffy tumor developing after sinusitis with a previous history of chronic sinusitis.  As what is predominant with this disease, this was an adolescent male.  On presentation this patient had significant proptosis, eyelid edema with a mild headache, but remained afebrile.  Both CT and MRI images were obtained that confirmed the presence of a soft tissue density from the left frontal sinus, causing proptosis and downward displacement of the left globe.   The proptosis was, however, unlikely related to direct infection, since there was no evidence of periosteal abscess in the roof of the orbit or inflammatory change in the orbital fat. Intravenous vancomycin and meropenem were chosen to give coverage for resistant Staphylococcus aureus as well as gram-negative and aerobic coverage with penetration into the CSF.  Surgical drainage was also completed.  There were no complications in this cases due to a timely diagnosis and treatment and appropriate follow up with the specialists.
