Physical exam demonstrated increasing abdominal circumfrence and tenderness over a period of 1 week.
In studies with sonography, pseudocysts were seen to resolve in 25 to 40% of patients. Pseudocysts that are greater than 5 cm in diameter and that persist for longer than 6 weeks should be considered for drainage. Recent natural history studies have suggested that noninterventional, expectant management is the best course in selected patients with minimal symptoms and no evidence of active alcohol use in whom the pseudocyst appears mature by radiography and does not resemble a cystic neoplasm. A significant number of these pseudocysts resolve spontaneously more than 6 weeks after their formation. Also, these studies demonstrate that large pseudocyst size is not an absolute indication for interventional therapy and that many peripancreatic fluid collections detected on CT in cases of acute pancreatitis resolve spontaneously. In patients who are stable and free of complications, and in whom serial ultrasound studies show that the pseudocyst is shrinking, conservative therapy is indicated. Conversely, if the pseudocyst is expanding and is complicated by rupture, hemorrhage, or abscess, the patient should be operated on. With ultrasound or CT guidance, sterile chronic pseudocysts can be treated safely with single or repeated needle aspiration or more prolonged catheter drainage with a success rate of 45 to 75%. The success rate of these techniques for infected pseudocysts is considerably less (40 to 50%). Patients who do not respond to drainage require surgical therapy for internal or external drainage of the cyst.
Upright abdominal plain film showing displacement of stomac and course of the Dobhoff feeding tube by a large, left paracentral, abdominal mass.

An axial CT image of upper abdomen without contrast demonstrates a fluid collection in the Lesser sac. note the dense, thin rim in the periphery representing the fibrous capsule. These findings are consistent with a pancreatic pseudocyst.

Pancreatic hemorrhage
Cystic Pancreatic Neoplasm
18 year-old male with history of T cell lymphoma, common bile duct dysfunction, MRSA, and candida albicans sepsis, and recent distributive shock clinical picture presents with acute pancreatitis possibly secondary to L-asparaginase therapy.
On CT, pseudocysts are round or oval in shape, and have a relatively thin (1-2mm) symmetrical capsule and a fluidly content of <15 HU. They can vary significantly in size. Their circumferential capsule can later calcify, and they can dissect fascial planes traveling sometimes at great distances from the mediastinum to the lower pelvis. The detection of a cystic lesion with an even thick capsule containing peripheral or lumenal soft tissue nodules or septations is less consistent with a pseudocyst and more indicative of a neoplastic process with associated necrosis. When the attenuation values of the pseudocyst are slightly elevated, associated necrotic tissue or secondary infection should be suspected. Higher attenuation values of >40 to 50 HU are indicative of intracystic hemorrhage.
