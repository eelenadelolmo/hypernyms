The patient was seen by Neurosurgery on admission, the initial impression was Right Temporal Abscess.  There did not appear to be an extra-cranial source of infection (TTE and CT scan of chest were both unremarkable)   The patient was placed on high-dose steroids, antibiotics and, anti-emetics  then scheduled for Right temporal craniotomy to drain the abscess.  The patient tolerated the surgery well with no residual neurological deficits and resolution of nausea and vomiting.  She was discharged home 2 days post-surgery on Linezolid with follow-up in Neurosurgery clinic.  

The neurosurgery operative Report confirms the presence of an abscess.  A Gram stain of fluid recovered from the abscess showed numerous Gm+ Cocci in clusters.  Culture of this abscess fluid grew Methicillin Resistant Staph Aureus (Resist: Amp, Erythro, Oxacillin, Penicillin.  Sens: Dapto, Levoflox, Linezolid, Tet, TMP/SMX, Vanc, Gent, Clinda) .  Cultures for anerobes, mycosis or tuberculosis were all negative.
A CT performed at the time of presentation showed a 2.8 cm ring-enhancing right temporal lesion with surrounding vasogenic edema.  (Images not available for review)

There is an approximately 2.6 x 2.7 cm ring-enhancing lesion within the lateral aspect of the right temporal lobe. This lesion has a uniform, smooth rim of enhancement with decreased T2 signal characteristics, and central areas of restricted diffusion.  There is vasogenic edema surrounding the lesion throughout the right temporal lobe which tracks into the basal ganglia.  

There is  mass effect with sulcal effacement, compression of the right lateral ventricle, and 7 mm of midline shift at the septum pellucidum. There is no hydrocephalus. 

No additional regions of pathologic enhancement or areas concerning for abscess are identified. There is no area of acute infarction. Flow-related signal within the major intracranial vessels is preserved.  Incidental note is made of thickening of the outer table of the calvarium in the bifrontal convexity, of doubtful clinical significance, likely representing an old cephalohematoma.
Pyogenic Abscess (MRSA)
• Brain Metastasis w/ Occult Primary
- Lung, Breast, Skin, Kidney, GI tract) 
• Primary Brain Tumor (GBM, Lymphoma)
• Pyogenic Abscess
• Infarct/Hemorrhage
• Subdural Hematoma
• Multiple Sclerosis
50 y.o. woman with a chief complaint of persistent Nausea and Vomiting of 3 weeks duration.  The patient denied fever, chills, trauma, or prior intracranial problems.
The patient is a 50 year-old woman with an intraparenchymal mass confirmed by both CT and MR imaging.  This mass measures approximately 3 cm in diameter and demonstrates ring-enhancement on both CT and MR.  The patient is HIV negative and has no findings in her labs or on physical exam concerning for immunodeficiency.  The mass is likely responsible for the patient's nausea and vomiting as well as for her metabolic derangements.  As such, some treatment should be instituted to relieve the patient's symptoms.  

The major drive in this case, then, was the characterization of the patient's intraparenchymal mass in order determine the course that this treatment should take.  The differential of intraparenchymal subcortical ring-enhancing lesions is extensive and includes tumor (both primary and metastatic), pyogenic abscess, infarct or hemorrhage, and demyelinating disease, such as multiple sclerosis.
