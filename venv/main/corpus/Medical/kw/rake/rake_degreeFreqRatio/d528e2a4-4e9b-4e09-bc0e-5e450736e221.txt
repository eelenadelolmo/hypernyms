Unremarkable physical exam and labs
Excision

There are lesions of low grade malignant potential which occur in young patients with long life expectancy and are excised.

Histology shows the cells oriented perpendicularly to thin vascular cores and nuclei lined up towards luminal aspect of irregular tissue crevices, consistent with pseudopapilla. PAS negative for mucin.
