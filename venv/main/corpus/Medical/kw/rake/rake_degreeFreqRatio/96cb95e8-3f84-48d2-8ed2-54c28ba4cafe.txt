Normal CBC.
ESR slightly elevated at 29 mm/hr.
Lung Biopsy:  Pathologic specimen demonstrated spatially and temporally homogenous areas of lung fibrosis and inflammation. 
Bronchial washings and cultures were all negative for an infectious process.
Treatment for Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia involves corticosteroids.  The abnormalities of NSIP seen on CT often completely or partially resolve with treatment.
PA and Lateral Chest Radiographs: Increased interstitial markings at the apices of both lungs with the right being greater than the left.  Nodular opacity in the right upper lobe.

Computed Tomography Examination of the Chest: Low and symmetric lung volumes.  There are course upper lobe ground glass and reticular opacities which are more prominent in the right lung as compared to the left.  Two focal calcific densities are also present within the ground glass opacities of the right upper lobe.
Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP)
Infection
Chronic Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis
Respiratory Bronchiolitis-Associated Interstitial Lung Disease (RB-ILD)
Sarcoidosis
Collagen Vascular Disease
Drug Reaction
Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP)/Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)
Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia (COP)
Presents complaining of shortness of breath.
The radiographic differential diagnosis for this case includes infection; however, cultures were all negative for any known pathologic organisms.  Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis is also in the differential.  The most common causes of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis include Farmer’s lung from moldy hay, Bagassosis from moldy sugar cane, Mushroom worker’s lung from mushroom compost, Ventilation pneumonitis from dust or mist, Maltworkers lung from moldy barely, and Bird fancier’s (breeder’s) lung from bird droppings and feathers.  The patient denied any history or exposure to these known sources for hypersensitivity pneumonitis.  The patient denied any history of smoking which makes RB-ILD very unlikely.  RB-ILD is usually asymptomatic; however, in rare cases, heavy smokers can develop substantial pulmonary symptoms.  RB-ILD usually affects heavy smokers with an average exposure of more than 30 pack-years.  From the radiographic findings, sarcoidosis is definitely in the differential; however, the lung biopsy did not show any histologic evidence of noncaseating epithelioid cell granulomas making this diagnosis much less likely.  A collagen vascular disorder is still within the differential and lab results are currently pending.  The patient denied any drug or medication use making a drug reaction very unlikely.  Usual interstitial pneumonia is not the diagnosis because it’s radiographic features include a basal and peripheral predominance with patchy reticular patterns and honeycombing.  This patient’s lung findings are predominantly in the upper lobes and spares the bases.  Moreover, UIP typically affects men over 50 years of age.  COP is less likely because it typically presents with a consolidative pattern that fails to resolve with antibiotics.  The spatial and temporal homogeneity of fibrosis and inflammation seen on the lung biopsy are consistent with NSIP.
