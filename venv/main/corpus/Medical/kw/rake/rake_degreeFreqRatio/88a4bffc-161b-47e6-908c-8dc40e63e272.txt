Texto: 
Mild mid to right upper abdominal tenderness.  No guarding.  Laboratory values include mildly elevated amylase and lipase.
Transferred to larger institution for surgical management and follow up.
Ultrasound shows normal kidneys with incidental note of a cystic lesion near the head of the pancreas consistent with a choledochal cyst.
  
MRI Abdomen w/o contrast:  Fusiform dilatation of the common bile duct with mild intrahepatic ductal dilatation

CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast:  dilatation of the common bile duct  with mildly dilated intrahepatic ducts 

Choliangiogram:  cystic dilatation of the common bile duct. Normal gallbladder.  Mild intrahepatic ductal dilatation.  Normal contrast seen in the duodenum.
Choledochal Cyst, type IV
Differential Diagnosis: Hepatic cyst, biliary duct tumors,choledochal cyst, pancreatic pseudocyst, biliary obstruction, cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder duplication
Cyclical vomiting and complaints of abdominal pain.
