Texto: 
as per ordering provider, tenderness to palpation at the proximal diaphysis of the tibia
patient is to stop offending activity immediately
CT findings of cortical fracture lucency with periosteal reactive changes indicating healing.
Stress fracture
Acute traumatic fracture
nutrient vessel
with shin pain for weeks, training for marathon, r/o stress fracture
The ordering provider ordered a CT, instead of nuclear medicine bone scan or MRI.  This is not the gold standard test to identify stress fracture.  But, with wide window and level settings, the diagnosis could be made.
