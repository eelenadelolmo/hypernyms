Normal physical exam.
None. Benign process. Patient does not have lung based pathology. Patient to follow-up if symptoms present.
On PA and lateral radiographs, multiple 'holly leaf' appearing well circumscribed plaques are seen when viewed en face. When viewed in profile, the plaques appear squared off and linear, resembling a geologic "butte".
Asbestos related pleural plaques
• PREVIOUS EMPYEMA - adjacent lung usually abnormal. scarring from previous pneumonia.
• MESOTHELIOMA - Unilateral, nodular thickening (>1cm), creeping mediastinal pleura and/or circumferential involvement. Nearly always associated with pleural effusion.
• PREVIOUS HEMOTHORAX - Unilateral, multiple healed rib fractures.
• METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA - Lobulated unilateral pleural thickening in patient with known malignancy; may be indistinguishable from mesothelioma.
• SUBPLEURAL FAT - Symmetric, mid-lateral chest wall 4th-8th ribs; may extend into fissures. Associated with other fat deposition: Pericardial fat pads, widened mediastinum; No calcification.
• PERIPHERAL BRONCHOGENIC CARCINOMA - may mimic rounded atelectasis. Spiculated outline (Not comet tail).
• RIB FRACTURES - Abnormal rib contour, posterolateral location
• SERRATUS ANTERIOR MUSCLE - Symmetric mid chest wall, between intercostal spaces; Triangular shape with edge fading inferiorly and no calcification.
55 year old man for routine physical exam and chest radiograph. History of being an industrial worker.
