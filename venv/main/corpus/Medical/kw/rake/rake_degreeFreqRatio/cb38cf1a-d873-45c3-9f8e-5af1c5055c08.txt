Periodic follow-up as symptoms arise.
Multiple polyostotic metaphyseal exophytic lesions.
Osteochondromatosis (Multiple Hereditary Exostosis)
Pathognomonic
4 year old female refered from another facility for suspected rickets.  Pediatric radiology service was asked to review the films.
Multiple hereditary exostosis (osteochondromatosis) is characterized by palpable osseous projections from the cortex of the bone, joint restrictions, and secondary osseous deformities. Deformities that are frequently noted include widening of the proximal femoral metaphysis, bilateral coxa valga, deviation and shortening of the ulna, and forearm shortening. This disorder is autosomal dominant and is seen in the first or second decade of life. It is distinguished from OSTEOCHONDROMA by its multiplicity. Greater than one hundred protuberances may be present and they are commonly symmetric. Complications include vascular injury, neurologic compromise, bursa formation, pathologic fracture and malignant transformation.
As opposed to osteochondromatosis, rickets is a metabolic disorder.  It is due to vitamin D insufficiency.  This can be a result of dietary deficiency, malabsorption, renal disease, or lack of end-organ response.  Radiological findings include metaphyseal fraying, cupping and irregularity along the physeal margin.   Osteomalacia is also seen.
