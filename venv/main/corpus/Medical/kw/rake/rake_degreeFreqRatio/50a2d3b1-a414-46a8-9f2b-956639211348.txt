General â€“ well appearing infant in no acute distress, sitting comfortably in momâ€™s arms, interested and interactive on exam â€“ grabs at stethoscope, no stranger anxiety. 
HEENT: NC/AT, eyes without discharge, PERRLA, ears normal/TMs clear, nares clear without discharge or dried blood, neck supple without LAD. 
Mouth: sucks on bottle when presented for ~10 seconds but will stop and cry and then reattempt to suck; finished 1oz in 5-10 minutes but went to sleep afterwards. Tenderness to palpation at upper jaw line and with percussion along jaw line. No swelling or erythema of mandible. 
CV:  regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, brisk cap refill
Pulm: clear to auscultation bilaterally
Abd: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly 
Ext: moves all extremities spontaneously 
Neuro: normal tone and strength on exam
Skin: small abrasion on chin, no other lesions, rashes, or bruises on body.
She is admitted to pediatric inpatient ward for observation and assistance with feeding.  

Bilateral mandibular condylar fractures. Suspicion for NAT is low given mechanism of injury consistent with history (throughout ED resident and staff interview, pediatrics interview, and OMFS interview). Mechanism of injury also most common cause of mandibular fractures per OMFS team â€“ also supported by CT. No other concerning features of NAT on exam or history.

FEN/GI:
-routine I/O
-syringe feeding with formula and bottle feeding with formula as tolerated 
-fluid goal of 120ml/kg/day, feed Q3-4 hours 
-advance oral feeds as tolerated 

Pain control:
-Tylenol 15mg/kg/dose Q6HR
-Ibuprofen 10mg/kg/dose Q6HR
The right mandibular condyle is fractured with the fractured condylar fragment medially displaced and dislocated from the mandibular fossa.  Additionally, there is a minimally displaced fracture of the left mandibular condyle which is best seen on thin section images. 
The calvarium is intact.  The orbits and extracalvarial soft tissues are unremarkable. There is no intracranial hemorrhage. There is no evidence of mass or mass effect.  There are no areas of pathologic attenuation within the brain parenchyma. The CSF-containing spaces are symmetric and normal in appearance. 

Impression:  
1. No intracranial hemorrhage.  
2. Right moderately to severely displaced high condylar neck fracture with displacement of the condylar head medially and inferiorly; displaced condylar head demonstrating displacement from the fossa but also demonstrates contact with the medial aspect of the remainder of the right condylar neck
3. Left non-displaced intracapsular fracture of the condylar head
Bilateral mandibular condyle fractures
Bilateral mandibular condylar fracture
Unilateral mandibular condylar fracture
Bilateral/Unilatera mandibular angle fracture
Non-Accidental Trauma (NAT)
Patient is a 6-month-old, previously healthy girl who presented to the ED 30 minutes after a 2 ft fall from the couch, landing on her chin while playing with her older sister.  Immediately afterwards, infant was crying but consolable. Infant refused bottle feeding, which prompted parents to bring her to ED.  She is on a regular feeding schedule and sleeps through the night.
Jaw fractures are relatively uncommon in the US population.  Most occur in older patients, with only 4.1 % occurring in patients younger than 5 years old.(1) Additionally, 54% are the result of an assault, followed by motor vehicle accident and finally falls.  In pediatric patients violence becomes the fourth most common cause behind motor vehicle accidents (53%), falls (16.6%), and bicycle falls (11.4%).(2)  
   Plain film is not as sensitive due to obscuring by other structures and incomplete ossification.  Often greenstick fractures, common in younger patients, are not displaced, further complicating diagnosis via plainfilm.   Specialized radiographic techniques have been devised to help visualize the whole facial skeleton, including panoramic radiographs.  However, the diagnosing modality of choice is non-contrast CT via low dose scanning protocols.  This can reveal fractures that would otherwise not be visualized on plain film.  Additionally, the use of 3D rendering can provide precise depiction of anatomic details for both diagnosis and surgical treatment planning.(3)
   Non-operative treatment is preferred in younger patients due to skeletal immaturity and the potential for interrupting or limiting the osteogenic potential of facial bones and disturbing normal dental development.  Surgical treatment was used in 78.7 % of patients in one study, with the frequency of surgical treatment increasing with age.(2) In this study 65% of patients were thirteen years old or older, which may account for the high rate of surgical treatment.
