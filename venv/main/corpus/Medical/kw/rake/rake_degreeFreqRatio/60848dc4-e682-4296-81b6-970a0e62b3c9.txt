"Gullwing" deformities secondary to central erosions are scattered throughout the interphalangeal joints, most prominent at the ring finger DIP and the middle finger PIP. Typical osteoarthritic findings include joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophytosis seen in the distal greater than the proximal interphalangeal joints, with prominent carpometacarpal degenerative changes at the base of the thumb.

Erosive osteoarthritis
Psoriatic osteoarthritis
73 yo woman with chronic hand pain
The central erosions, lack of periostitis, and abundant small osteophytes are most consistent with erosive osteoarthritis.
