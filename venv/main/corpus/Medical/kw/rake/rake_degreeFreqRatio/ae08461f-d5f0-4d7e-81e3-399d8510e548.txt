Pre and post removal attempt IVC cavagrams are shown with the head of the IVC filter either within, or pressed up against, the right posterior wall of the IVC.  On the post procedure image, two legs of the filter are more superior within the IVC which occurred after multiple attempts to grasp the filter tip.

Failed attempt to remove an IVC filter.
A 22 y.o. sustained multiple combat injuries and required placement of a removable IVC filter 2 months ago.  He no longer requires an IVC filter and presents for filter removal.
