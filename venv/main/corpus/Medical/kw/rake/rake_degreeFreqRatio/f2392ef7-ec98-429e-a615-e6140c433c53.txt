Patient is a well-developed, well-nourished boy that has good eye contact and a nontoxic appearance. His lower forehead is edematous and tender to palpation just superior to his eyes. The edema extends down into the periorbital region. Extraocular movements are intact and painless. Pupils are equal and reactive. Fundoscopic exam is unremarkable. His tympanic membranes, oral cavity, and pharynx are normal in appearance. His cardiac, pulmonary, abdominal, neurological, and skin exam is otherwise unremarkable.

His white blood cell count at presentation was 17,000 with a left-shift. His ESR was also elevated.
Once the subperiosteal abscess was identified, the patient was taken to the operating room where he received a craniotomy and abscess drainage. Initial broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage included vancomyocin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole. The abscess culture eventually grew peptostreprococcus and the patient was switched to monotherapy with meropenem. He completed 6 weeks of IV antibiotics and resolution of his abscess was confirmed with a MRI. He was also scheduled for follow-up with an ENT to evaluate his sinuses.
Head CT without contrast:
•Soft tissue edema with small subcutaneous fluid collection above the left eye
•6 mm lentiform shaped fluid collection in the intracranial region which has a high attenuation margin suspicious for a subperiosteal abscess
•Soft tissue density is present in frontal and ethmoid sinuses
Pott's Puffy Tumor
•Pott’s Puffy Tumor
•Carbuncle
•Infected sebaceous cyst
•Dermoid cyst
•Lipoma
•Intraosseous lipoma
•Lipoblastoma
•Giant frontal sinus mucocele
•Intracranial malignant meningioma
•Superficial temporal artery pseudoaneurysms
•Trauma
Previously healthy 6 year-old male presents with a 5-day history of fever, worsening headache, nausea, emesis, decreased oral intake, and slightly decreased activity. His parents started to notice some forehead-localized edema 4 days ago that has now worsened to include both of his eyes. Patient denies phonophobia, photophobia, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, cough, neck pain, visual disturbances, tinnitus, and altered mental status.
