Exam: Thyroid is nontender, left lobe visibly larger than right, soft on palpation, normal movement during swallow.

Labs: TSH WNL
Large thyroid nodule with FNA suspicious for papillary vs follicular carcinoma. 

Papillary TC ruled out by intraoperative frozen section.  Definitive diagnosis unknown at time of case compilation pending final pathology report.

This patient underwent a hemithyroidectomy during the second trimester.  She may undergo removal of her remaining thyroid, followed by post-partum radioiodine ablation, depending on the final pathology report.
Within the mid to lower pole of the left lobe, there is
a large predominantly solid nodule with a small cystic component superiorly. This nodule measures 2.6 x 2.1 x 3.8 cm.  No microcalcifications.  Some intranodular vascularity, primarily peripheral.  Nodule margins are smooth and well defined.

Inflammatory Process
27 y/o woman with known thyroid asymmetry x 2 years, presents for initial prenatal appointment.  No previous workup for gland asymmetry.  Patient denies hypo/hyperthyroid symptoms.  Hx negative for neck irradiation.
This case highlights the differences in decision making for the pregnant patient with a newly diagnosed, asymptomatic thyroid nodule. One may postpone workup in the euthymic pregnant patient up to one year from time of nodule discovery without affecting her outcome.  A postpartum workup allows for additional tests such as radioactive iodine uptake, although these tests are of negligible value in the euthymic patient.

If the nodule is worked up early in pregnancy and treatment requires surgical removal of the nodule, the patient must decide whether to proceed with surgery during or after pregnancy.  The second trimester is the preferred time to undergo elective procedures; procedures at surgical sites remote to the abdomen are considered especially low risk to the fetus. 
 
However, if the newly diagnosed patient prefers to postpone surgery until the postpartum period, she may do so without affecting her outcome, even if she has thyroid malignancy with local lymph node mets.
  
The pregnant patient who requires radioiodine ablation following surgery must wait to undergo RIA until she is not only postpartum, but no longer breast feeding and has significanly reduced lactation.  Otherwise, RIA may increase her risk of breast cancer later in life.
