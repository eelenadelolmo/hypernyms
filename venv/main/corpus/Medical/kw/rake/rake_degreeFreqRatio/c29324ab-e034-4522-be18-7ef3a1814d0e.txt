Pneumomediastinum
Pneumomedistinum
Patient with history of shortness of breath and difficulty swallowing.
A good question to ask is "does this patient have asthma and were they having symptoms?"  Well, 2 questions.

Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is often seen in association with asthma attacks and the patients frequently have relatively minor symptoms despite the volume of air in soft tissues.  Searches for the source are usually unyielding.
