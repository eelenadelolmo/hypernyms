Patient on dialysis.  Physical exam not performed (exam information not available to contributor).
The patient is currently under evaluation for a renal transplant.
The MRI images demonstrate too numerous to count cysts within both kidneys.  The kidneys are grossly enlarged (14cm cc).  There are multiple simple cysts, but some cysts have high signal intensity fluid within.  There was no definitive abnormal enhancement seen, so no malignacies were noted.  The ordering physician was informed that, due to the large number of cysts, small neoplastic lesions could not be completely ruled out.
Also noted were several simple hepatic cysts.
ADPKD -Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
Multiple cysts due to dialysis
42 year old male with end-stage renal disease under evaluation for transplant. The study was ordered to exclude the possibility of existing neoplasms(s) in the kidneys.
