Texto: 
Markedly elevated parathyroid hormone level (893), as well as an elevated calcium level (10.3)
The patient underwent complete excision of the surgically reimplanted parathyroid tissue in the right neck, as well as the ectopic parathyroid tissue in the left superior mediastinum. Because both parathyroid tissues were histologically abnormal (parathyroid hyperplasia), the surgeon decided not to reimplant parathyroid tissue into this patient.

49 year old female patient with a history of end stage renal disease and hyperparathyroidism, post parathyroid gland surgical excision and reimplantation, who presents asymptomically with an increased parathyroid hormone level and serum calcium.
This patient with a history of chronic renal failure presented with a markedly elevated parathyroid level after already having a parathyroidectomy (with parathyroid tissue reimplantation) because of parathyroid hyperplasia involving the surgically reimplanted parathyroid tissue in the right neck, as well as ectopic parathyroid tissue in the left superior mediastinum.
