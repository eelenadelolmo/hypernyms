AP radiograph of right knee.
No treatment is necessary as it represents a sequalae of healing of the MCL. It can spontaneously regress after time.
- Tunnel for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Allograft
- Fixation screws for allograft
- Heterotopic Ossification of the superior portion of the medial collateral ligament of the right knee
Pelligrini-Stieda Lesion
None
33 year old male with history of rupture of right anterior cruciate ligament. Patient was status post allograft repair of right ACL Tear about 1 year prior to follow-up knee radiograph.
A Pelligrini–Stieda lesion is calcification within the medial collateral ligament,mostly in the femoral portion secondary to traumatic tear and subsequent healing process.There is some contraversy as to whether it represents myositis ossificans or dystropihic calcification. Myositis ossificans in general rarely affects tendons and ligaments in contradistinction to dystrophic calcification which more often does. 
However, myositis ossificans is frequently linked to antecedent history of trauma.
