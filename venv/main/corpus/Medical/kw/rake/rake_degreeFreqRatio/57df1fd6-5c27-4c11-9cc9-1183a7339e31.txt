Normal
No follow up required
Non contrast images revealed a mass in the left and right adrenal glands with low attenuation based upon Houndsfield units. The glands demonstrated a well circumscribed appareance, no peripheral calcifications and homogeneity through out the mass tissue. Upon contrast administration the gland enhanced and then on the delayed images, showed a wash out that was greater than 50%. Therefore, based on this findings, the lesions can be characterized as adrenal adenomas.
