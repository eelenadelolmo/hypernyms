Texto: 
Left breast distinctly larger than the right breast.  There is diffuse erythema, brawny edema and peau d’orange covering approximately two-thirds of the breast.  No distinct breast masses or nipple discharge.  Multiple mobile congruent masses were palpated in the left axilla. Normal right breast and axilla.  Left supraclavicular palpable mass.
The patient is currently being treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  This will be followed by mastectomy, post surgical radiation treatments and maintenance chemotherapy.
Initial MRI:
	Axial Gradient Echo demonstrates  asymmetric enlargement of the fibroglandular tissue of the left breast, most prominent in the posterior-lateral aspect.  No distinct masses identified.  Three distinct, enlarged and rounded left axillary lymph nodes. Axial Post Gadolinium GRE show diffuse heterogeneous enhancement throughout most of the fibroglandular tissue of the left breast.  The axillary lymph nodes and the skin demonstrate abnormal enhancement. Sagittal Post Gadolinium images lateral to the nipple demonstrates diffuse enlargement and abnormal enhancement of the fibroglandular tissue, consistent with a diffuse infiltrating process.  No discrete masses identified.  Images at the level of the nipple demonstrate significant nipple retraction.   

Post Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy MRI:
     Axial Gradient Echo shows near resolution of the asymmetric enlargement of the left breast fibroglandular tissue. 
Axial Post Gadolinium shows there has been near resolution of the asymmetric enlargement of the left breast fibroglandular tissue.  There is residual heterogeneous enhancement throughout the fibroglandular tissue, although much improved.  The lymph nodes have decreased in size.  Sagittal Post Gadolinium demonstate the nipple retraction has resolved.  The skin is much improved but still remains residually thickened and enhanced.

46 y/o woman had a normal screening mammogram in June 2002.  In November 2002 she noticed left axillary lymphadenopathy, but an excisional biopsy showed reactive lymph node, no carcinoma.

In July 2003, she noticed left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.

In August 2003 patient began to notice left breast enlargement, diffuse skin thickening and erythema, and upper extremity edema.
This woman had a normal screening mammogram in June 2002.  In November 2002 the patient noticed left axillary lymphadenopathy.  She underwent an excisional biopsy, which showed reactive lymph node, no carcinoma.  In July 2003, she noticed left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.  In August 2003 patient began to notice left breast enlargement, diffuse skin thickening and erythema, and upper extremity edema.  A mammogram performed at that time showed interval increase in size of axillary lymph nodes and a diffuse increase in attenuation of left breast compared to the right.  Yet no discrete or suspicious mass could be seen in either side.  In October 2003, had excisional biopsy of left supraclavicular node and a punch biopsy of the skin of the breast.  Results of those biopsies showed metastatic cancer consistent with breast primary in the lymph node and invasive ductal carcinoma with involvement of the skin lymphatics (Inflammatory Carcinoma) on the skin biopsy.  MRI was performed at the time to evaluate for primary lesion not seen on mammogram.
