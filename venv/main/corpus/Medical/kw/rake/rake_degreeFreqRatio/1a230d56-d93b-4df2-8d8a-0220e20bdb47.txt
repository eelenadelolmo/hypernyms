Both images demonstrate opacification of a minimally dilated, ectopic, blind-ending ureteral tract arising from the distal portion of the functional ureter.  No visualized filling defect.  The left kidney is drained entirely by the single complete ureter.
Blind-ending ureter
blind ending ureter/ureteral diverticulum
