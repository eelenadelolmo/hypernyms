Surgical clips are seen in the right upper quadrant in the expected region of the gallbladder fossa.
Numerous embolization coils are seen in vertical orientation in the paraspinal regions overlying the paths the gonadal veins bilaterally.  
A stent is seen in the left hemipelvis, projecting over the expected region of the left common iliac artery.
Status post Cholecystectomy, stenting of the left common iliac artery stent, and bilateral gonadal vein embolization for pelvic congestion syndrome!
- Cholecystectomy
 - Left common iliac artery stent
 - Bilateral gonadal vein embolization for pelvic congestion syndrome
41 yo female with right lower quadrant pain, history of surgery.  Remote history of chronic pelvic pain, post-prandial epigastric pain and left lower extremity pain with activity.
Typically the aorta bifurcates at approximately the L4-L5 interspace.  The superior aspect of the stent seen in this case projects above this level.
