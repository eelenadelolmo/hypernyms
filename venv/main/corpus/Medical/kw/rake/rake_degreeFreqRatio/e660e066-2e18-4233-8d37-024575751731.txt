Texto: 
Open femur fracture on left.  Normal neurologic exam on arrival to ER.  Over the course of the next 4 hours there was a steady decline in mental status which progressed to coma over 24 hours.
Supportive with patient expect to be taken off of life support following second MRI.
Initial CT brain considered normal.
CT 8 hours after admission reveals diffuse cerebral edema.
MRI done 3 hours after second CT showed multiple foci of restricted diffusion consistent with acute infarction.
MRI done 8 days after admission reveals diffuse brain swelling with abnormal signal throughout the supratentorial white matter and basal ganglia.
Fat Embolism
Prolonged severe hypoxia
Drowning
Cardiac arrest
Traumatic Axonal Injury
Cerebral Fat Embolism
25 year old man who stuck tree while driving his ATV.
He fractured his femur and pubic rami.  No head trauma.  He was able to  crawl an unknown distance to the nearest road to get assistance.
