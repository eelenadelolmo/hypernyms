The patient’s left eye appeared smaller than his right eye on exam.  His pupils were reactive to light but slightly sluggish on the left.  He demonstrated relative afferent papillary defect on the left during the swinging flashlight exam.  Fundoscopic exam showed decreased vasculature on the left fundi with yellowish discoloration.  An MRI and CT were ordered to further evaluate this patient.
This patient now has total loss of vision in his left eye.  He has since been lost to follow-up.
The left globe is smaller then the right globe on all images.  The anterior chamber of the eye also appears slightly smaller on the left.  On the FSE T2 image, there is a linear hypodensity noted that may represent Cloquet's canal.  On the T2 Flair image, it demonstrates an increased signal vitreous on the left when compared to the right.  On the T1 images, the left globe did not enhance post contrast.  The same linear hypodensity is somewhat visualized on the T1 images.
Persistent Hyperplastic Primary Vitreous (PHPV)
Retinoblastoma
Coat’s disease
Retinopathy of prematurity
Congenital cataract
Toxocariasis
Norrie’s disease
Warburg’s Syndrome
3 y.o. boy who was born at 34 weeks gestation weighing 4 lb 12 oz.  He presents for imaging studies due to mild left hemiparesis, loss of vision in his left eye.  He has a complicated past medical history that includes coarctation of the aorta status post repair, pulmonary stenosis, and Ebstein’s anomaly status post repair.
This patient has somewhat of an atypical presentation of persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous in that he was diagnosed later in life, and did not demonstrate any documented leukokoria.  Most cases are picked up in the first few weeks to months of life.  He does, however, have the classic sign of micropthalmia and unilateral visual abnormalities.  Retinopathy of prematurity was also considered in the initial radiology workup; however, this patient does not have any prior history of this.
