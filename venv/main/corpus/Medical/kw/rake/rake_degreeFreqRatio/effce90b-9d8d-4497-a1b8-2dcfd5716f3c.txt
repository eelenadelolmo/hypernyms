PE:  Bilateral proptosis, mild periorbital edema, sclera clear, PERRLA, EOMI, no discharge
Treatment for Grave's ophthalmopathy depends on severity of symptoms.  If present, treat hyperthyroidism with methimazole.  For mild involvement including dry, irritated eyes, natural tears are helpful during the day and an eye lubricant (methycellulose) is appropriate at night.  For moderate disease that can include conjunctival erythema, progressive proptosis, and diplopia, prednisone 30mg daily for 4 weeks should be initiated additionally.  

External radiation may be used in conjunction with prednisone if high dose is contraindicated or not tolerated in the case of persistent orbital edema.  

In severe disease in which the patient presents with threatened loss or complete loss of vision, initial pulse therapy with intravenous methylprednisone or immediate intramuscular dexamethasone 4mg may be done before urgent orbital decompression surgery.  Surgery is also indicated for refractory disease despite glucocorticoids or cosmetic correction of severe proptosis.  

The orbit may be decompressed transantrally, which involves removal of medial wall and floor of the orbits.  This procedure is preferred over others because it does not involve craniotomy or extensive scarring. 
 
Follow-up should include monthly clinic visits that may be progressively spaced out to 3 months, 6 months, or 12 months - depending on patient's clinical course and severity of disease.  Regular follow-up with ophthalmology, endocrinology, and surgery as needed, particularly if patient has persistent or worsening symptoms, and especially if disease complications are anticipated.

45 year-old man with a past history of malignant testicular neoplasm and Hashimotoâ€™s thyroiditis, presents now with a several-month history of worsening eye swelling, dryness, and irritation, gradually progressing to lid retraction and intermittent blurry vision, prompting a referral to ophthalmology.  He denies recent trauma, fever, chills, nausea, headaches.
The patient has Graveâ€™s ophthalmopathy, but he does not have symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as heat intolerance, tachycardia, heart palpitations, tremors, anxiousness, and unintentional weight loss.  Rather, he is clinically hypothyroid and requires synthroid treatment.  With his past history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and subsequent thyroid ablation therapy, the patient may have little functional thyroid tissue left for clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism as a result of his Grave's disease.  However, the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) autoantibodies are still circulating and affect other cell types with TSHR antigens such as fibroblasts, adipocytes, and T-cells contributing to tissue proliferation, inflammation and edema consistent with Grave's ophthalmopathy and pretibial myxedema.
