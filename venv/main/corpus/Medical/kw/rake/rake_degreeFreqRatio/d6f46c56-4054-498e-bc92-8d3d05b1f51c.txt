A 1.4cm soft tissue density spiculated opacity - a solitary pulmonary nodule - is in the periphery of the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.  No other parenchymal lesions nor mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy is seen.

Nuclear medicine PET/CT fusion scan demonstrates increased F18-FDG metabolism in the right upper lobe nodule. The maximum standardized uptake value of this nodule was calculated and determined to be 5.65
Adenocarcinoma of the lung
1. Metastatic disease to lung
2. Primary pulmonary neoplasms (second primary malignancy)
   - Adenocarcinoma
   - Bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma
   - Squamous cell carcinoma or small cell carcinoma (somewhat less likely for this peripheral location) 
3. Postinflammatory/Postinfectious scar
76 y.o. woman for routine follow-up.  She has a past history of breast cancer (DCIS - ductal carcinoma in situ); and, is status post resection and radiation therapy five years ago.
