Noncontributory
The patient underwent fundoplication and monotomy.
-Multiple images from an upper GI series demonstrate a markedly dilated distal esophagus, which smoothly tapers to a beak at the GE junction.  There is abnormal accumulation of contrast within the distal esophagus.  Real-time evaluation demonstrated lack of normal peristalsis and relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter.
-Multiple images from an esophageal transit study using Tc-99m sulfur colloid mixed into a meal of cornflakes reveals delayed transit of the radiotracer through the distal esophagus.
Achalasia
-Achalasia
-Stricture from prior trauma, caustic ingestion, infection/inflammation, or neoplasm.
-Chagas disease
40 year old male with complaints of dysphagia.
The esophageal transit study can be used to evaluate esophageal motility disorders including achalasia pre and post repair.  While the exact protocol may vary between institutions, the patient consumes the Tc-99m sulfur colloid containing semi-solid meal (time 0) with their back to the scintillation camera in an upright position. An esophageal emptying curve is constructed showing the percentage of the radiotracer in the esophagus at 10sec intervals for 20 minutes.  Significant esophageal retention is seen in patients with achalasia over the entire 20 minutes while normal patients will have complete esophageal emptying by 5 minutes.
