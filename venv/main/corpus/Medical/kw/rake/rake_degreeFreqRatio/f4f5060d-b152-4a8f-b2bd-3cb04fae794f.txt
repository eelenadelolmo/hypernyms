AP, Lateral, and Oblique images of the left wrist demonstrate a bony exostosis from the distal head of the radius which demonstrates both cortical and medullary continuity.

AP radiographs of the bilateral knees demonstrate multiple bony projections from the distal femurs, proximal tibia, and proximal fibulas that demonstrate both cortical and medullary continuity.
