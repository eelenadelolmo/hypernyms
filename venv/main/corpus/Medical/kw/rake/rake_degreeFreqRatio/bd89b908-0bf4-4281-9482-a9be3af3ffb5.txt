No peritoneal signs on abdominal exam.  Labs within normal limits.
Self-limited
supportive pain palliation
Focal well circumscribed area of graying and fat stranding, with fat density centrally, adjacent to the descending colon.  The focus of inflammation gives rise to the hyperattenuating ring, characteristic of segmental omental infarction.
Epiploic Appendagitis
epiploic appendagitis
Segmental omental infarction (typically without low density centrally)
mesenteric panniculitis(similar findings, but not in this location)
diverticulitis (if diverticuli present)
