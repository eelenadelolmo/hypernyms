A plain film of the chest (Film 1) demonstrates diffuse opacification of the right hemithorax, suggesting a large right pleural effusion.

Abdominal ultrasound (Film 2) shows an abnormal 9 x 8.5 x 11 cm cystic mass in the right lobe of the liver with low-level internal echoes and posterior acoustic enhancement.

The differential diagnosis of a cystic liver mass should include simple hepatic cyst, hematoma, pyogenic abscess, amebic abscess, and necrotic neoplasm.

CT scans of the abdomen (Film 3) reveal a massive right pleural effusion with collapse of the right lung.  The cystic mass in the liver is again demonstrated with enhancement of the thickened cyst wall.

Blood serology studies were positive for amebiasis.  Aspiration of the fluid in the right pleural space revealed clear fluid with biochemical findings of a transudate.
Amebic abscess of the liver with a sympathetic pleural effusion
The CT appearance of hepatic echinococcal disease consists of low- density masses of variable size and number.  The borders are sharply defined.  Internal septations reveal the presence of daughter cysts.  CT may demonstrate complications of echinococcal disease, including cyst calcification, secondary infection, biliary obstruction, and portal hypertension.

Hydatid cysts of the lung appear as solitary homogeneous masses.  They are well-circumscribed and vary in size from 1 to 20 cm or larger.  Very large cysts can fill an entire hemithorax, displacing the mediastinum to the opposite side and causing signs of compression.  More commonly, pulmonary hydatid cysts are an incidental finding on routine chest radiographs.  They generally remain asymptomatic unless they rupture into the bronchial tree or pleura.

This is a 27-year-old Latin American female with low-grade fever, right upper quadrant pain, and shortness of breath.  Look at the chest film and sonogram (Films 1 and 2) ONLY and make a differential diagnosis.
Although ultrasonic findings are generally not diagnostic of amebic abscess, certain suggestive patterns have been described.  The only diagnostic pattern is a hypoechoic lesion associated with disruption of the right hemidiaphragm in the absence of trauma.  Amebic abscess most often presents as a solitary hypoechoic area with or without well-defined walls.  At high gain settings, low-level echoes may be seen within the mass.  Acoustic enhancement may be less than that of known fluid-filled structures such as the gallbladder.  A less common presentation can be a complex mixture of cystic and echogenic components.

Amebic abscesses do not contain gas unless there is communication with bowel or lung.  They are usually located in the right lobe of the liver due to portal blood flow from the colon, which carries the causative organism.  Amebic abscesses are usually in the peripheral portions of the liver and often abut against the diaphragmatic surface.  They are rounded in configuration and can vary in size from 2 to 20 cm in diameter.

Following the institution of therapy, amebic abscesses may increase in size during the first 2 weeks.  Patients are clinically improved during this time, indicating adequate treatment.  With continued therapy, the abscess may become better defined and more anechoic.  After completion of therapy, the mass may resolve, calcify, or persist as a cystic mass.

Plain film findings are usually normal.  Abnormal findings include elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, right basilar infiltrates, and right pleural effusion.

Even with the above findings, amebic hepatic abscess cannot be differentiated from necrotic neoplasm or pyogenic abscess by sonography alone.  Careful correlation with the history and clinical findings are necessary to arrive at the correct diagnosis.  A trial of therapy usually will confirm the diagnosis.
