Abdominal Abscess
Crohnâ€™s fistula with abscess
Diverticulitis with abscess
Penetrating injury with abscess
57 yo man with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease) and diverticulosis. He presents now with left lower quadrant pain and fever.
This case presents a mild diagnostic dilemma when attempting to determine the etiology of the abscess.  The treatment is unchanged, however.
