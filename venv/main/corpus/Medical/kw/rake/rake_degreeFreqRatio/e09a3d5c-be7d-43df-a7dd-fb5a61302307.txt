Overweight white man.  No masses on abdominal exam.
Esophageal stent, expectant management
Upper GI fluoroscopy - shows a polypoid, ulcerated distal esophageal mass, with inflammatory changes vs. superficial spread into the adjacent gastric fundus.

CT shows multiple rounded lesions in the liver
Adenocarcinoma of the Esophagus
Esophageal adenocarcinoma metastatic to liver
Esophageal squamous carcinoma
Lymphoma
Leiomyosarcoma
Metastatic disease
64 yo gentleman who presents with 6 months of dysphagia to solids.  He did smoke, but quit 20 yrs ago.  He denies more than social drinking.  Admits to occasional esophageal reflux.
Adenocarcinoma is increasing in frequency.  Dysphagia should be evaluated with an upper GI, which is an easily performed test.  

Esophageal carcinoma spreads fairly quickly as the esophagus does not have a serosal membrane.
