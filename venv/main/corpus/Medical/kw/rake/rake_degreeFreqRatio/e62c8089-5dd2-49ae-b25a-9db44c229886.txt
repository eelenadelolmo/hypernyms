No significant findings with physical exam.
Solitary osteochondromas can grow large enough to require surgery. 

Osteochondromas can be chipped with an osteotome. The procedure should be performed only when the skeleton has matured, unless the lesion is symptomatic. This parient was scheduled for such a procedure.
Multiple radiographs of the right knee demonstrate an exostosis (ossoeus protuberance) that measures approximately 6mm in diameter extending off the medial metaphysis.
Osteochondroma
Osteoma, osteophyte, enthesophyte, heterotopic ossification such as (eg, myositis ossificans), and parosteal osteosarcoma can all mimic osteochondromas.
22 year old male soldier reports chronic dull ache within the medial aspect of right knee. Also reports sharp pain while supporting weight of body on right knee.
