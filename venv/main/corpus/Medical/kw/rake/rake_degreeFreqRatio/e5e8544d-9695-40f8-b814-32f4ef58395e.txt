Subluxation of cervival vertebral bodies usually occurs as a
result of an excessive flexion force that causes disruption of the ligamentous complex that stabilizes the facet joint. Consequently,the superior vertebra undergoes forward subluxation, or rotation with anterior displacement of the corresponding inferior articulating facet on the superior articulating.  Bilateral or unilateral facet lock may result.

There is a  a correlation between the presence of facet distraction and facet fracture or lock at the same or adjacent level. These are often associated with a rotational element, particularly if the mechanism of injury is a unilateral process. 73% of unilateral facet dislocations are associated with fractures of the involved articular processes. This is crucial for patient care, since it implies spinal instability.  Facet dislocation inthe presence of fracture is best evaluated by using thin section helical CT saggital and coronal  reconstruction.
