Texto: 
Palpable, firm nodule within the left testes.
Patient underwent left orchiectomy.
Within the left testes there is a 1.9cm well-defined heterogeneous but predominantly hypoechoic solid mass.
Testicular epidermoid cyst pathologically confirmed.
Germ Cell tumors
Stromal tumors
Metastasis
Abscess
Infarct
Granulomatous disease
23 year old male presents with new, firm, painless, left testicular mass.
This case illustrates the classic presentation of a testicular epidermoid cyst.  Patient presented with a firm, painless, palpable nodule which on ultrasound had some features which may suggest an epidermoid.  However, malignancy was still the greatest concern, and orchiectomy was performed.
