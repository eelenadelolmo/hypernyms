The lesion was biopsied to definitively exclude a neoplastic process.
•12 months following gamma knife therapy, follow up imaging revealed a rim-enhancing mass in the left temporal lobe adjacent to the posterior horn of the left ventricle. Surrounding this lesion is extensive T2-high signal, likely representing edema.
• Initial MR images show malacic changes in the frontal lobes with  an incidental prominent vascular structures suggestive of a developmental venous anomaly. 
•Arteriogram also performed to therapy confirmed the presence of an AVM, predominantly fed by left lateral posterior choroidal artery.
Radiation Necrosis
•Radiation Necrosis
•New Primary Brain neoplasm
•Metastatic disease 
• Infectious process
The patient is a 25 year old man who initially presented s/p snow mobile accident with multiple hemorrhagic contusions.  On initial evaluation, the patient was incidentally noted to have a left temporal Arteriovenous Malformation.  This AVM was subsequently treated with Gamma Knife therapy.  The patient now presents 12 months later with no complaints for routine follow up.
The diagnostic dilemma in the evaluation of a suspected region of radiation necrosis often lies in the exclusion of recurrent tumor.  In this case, without a prior history of neoplasm, the likelihood of a de novo tumor in the same location of radiation treatment is very low. Still, given the ambiguity of MRI findings coupled with equivocal results of MR spectroscopy imaging, the decision was made to biopsy the lesion.
