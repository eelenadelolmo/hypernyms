Blood patch
Marked distension of deep venous sinuses as well as spinal epidural veins.  The deep veins are rounded in configuration and engorged.

Prominent enhancement of dura.

No downward displacement of brainstem or drooping of chiasm
Intracranial hypotension
â€¢ Intracranial hypotension
â€¢ Dural sinus thrombosis
â€¢ Leptomeningeal spread of tumor
14 year old girl with HO of pseudotumor cerebri.  She has had multiple lumbar punctures for diagnosis and therapy.

Developed intractable headache precipitated by standing, one week prior to this study.
There is dramatic enhancement and engorgement of the cervical spinal epidural veins.  This may have prevented downward displacement of the posterior fossa structures through the foramen magnum.
