Right breast asymmetric enlargement 5 x 5 cm. Mild tenderness to palpation.  No discrete mass.  Normal left breast on exam.
Digital diagnostic mammogram with standard 2 view MLO and CC views show marked right breast gynecomastia and minimal left breast minimal gynecomastia. No mass, suspicious calcifications, or evidence of malignancy.
Gynecomastia
51 year old male referred to the breast care center for 5 week history of painful enlargement of the right breast.  Symptoms began after taking over the counter steroids containing dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) for about 1 year.  Enlargement of the breast had stabilized after stopping the steroids.
This patient is pending follow-up in the breast care center in several months.

"Regardless of the etiology of gynecomastia, the prognosis is excellent. Studies have shown that 90% of physiological gynecomastia involutes spontaneously within 2 years. In pathological-induced gynecomastia, medical or surgical treatment of the cause regresses gynecomastia, in most cases. In drug-induced gynecomastia, withdrawal of the medication leads to regression in 60% of patients. If the gynecomastia is of long duration, it is unlikely to spontaneously regress."
