Patient is afebrile with an unremarkable physical exam.  No recent labs
Young children with stage I and II reflux can usually be managed medically with daily prophylactic antibiotics and followed with periodic urine cultures.  Approximately 80% of these children will have resolution of reflux within 5 years.  Treatment of this patient should include daily trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or nitrofurantoin for antimicrobial prophylaxis and regular urine cultures at 1-3 month intervals until 3 consecutive cultures are negative.  Prophylaxis should be continued until reflux resolves as determined by annual radionuclide cystography.
Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) shows vesicoureteral reflux of contrast on the right side during filling.  The contrast extends from the vesicoureteral junction to the central collecting system showing a nondilated ureter and renal pelvis with normal calyceal fornices.  No vesicoureteral reflux is seen on the left side.

Right Grade II vesicoureteral reflux
5 year-old girl with history of treated febrile, right-sided pyelonephritis (culture positive for >100,000 colony forming units E. coli).  Family history of vesicoureteral reflux
Demonstration of vesicoureteral reflux requires either a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) or a radionuclide cystogram (RNC), and long term complications of this condition include recurrent pyelonephritis, renal scarring, end-stage renal failure, and late secondary hypertension.  Therefore it is recommended that all children under age 7 with a first UTI should undergo a VCUG for diagnosis and classification of reflux.1     International Classification of Vesicoureteral Reflux:  Grade I: ureter only  Grade II: ureter, pelvis, and calyces; no dilation, normal calyceal fornices  Grade III: mild to moderate dilation or tortuosity of the ureter/renal pelvis; slight or no blunting of the fornices  Grade IV: moderate dilation or tortuosity of the ureter/renal pelvis; complete obliteration of sharp angle of fornices, but maintenance of                    papillary impressions in majority of calyces.  Grade V: gross dilation and tortuosity of ureter/renal pelvis; papillary impressions are no longer visible in the majority of calyces.Treatment of children with Grades 1-II reflux is usually medical therapy with prophylactic antimicrobials and close follow-up (as described above for this patient).2  Surgical options (often in conjunction with medical therapy) exist for more severe reflux (Grades III-V), usually consisting of open surgical reimplantation of the vesicoureteral junction, although some investigations of less invasive techniques are promising.  These newer techniques include laparoscopic reimplantation as well as endoscopic injection of materials (e.g. Teflon) behind the ureter to provide a valve mechanism during bladder filling and emptying.3,4
