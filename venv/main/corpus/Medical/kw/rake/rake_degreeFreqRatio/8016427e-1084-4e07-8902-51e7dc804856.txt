10 m/o male s/p viral illness 10 days ago, presents today with colicky abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and non-bilious vomiting.  Reported to repeatedly draw knees into chest which improves patient‚Äôs disposition.
Intussusception is defined as the invagination of a part of the intestine into itself.  It is most common in children between the ages of 5 mo ‚Äì 2 yrs (though this figure varies between sources), and in this age group it is the most common reason for small bowel obstruction.  However, intussusception can happen in any age group.  For children under the age of 5, most likely it is due to hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue in the gut and often follows a viral illness.  For this reason, the most common time of the year for this to occur is during the winter months.  In older children and adults, a pathologic lead point is more common as a cause of intussusception, and the differential diagnosis for this this may include lymphoma, Meckel‚Äôs diverticulum, polyps, cancer, vascular malformation, post-surgery, Crohn‚Äôs disease (strictures), Henoch-Schoenlein Purpura, Ascaris parasite load, and cystic fibrosis.  
Children typically present in a fashion similar to the patient in this case, notably drawing the knees into the chest will help to relieve the pain entirely temporarily, with repeat episodes occurring every 15-20 minutes.  A sausage-shaped mass may be palpated in the abdomen.  Patience is necessary‚Äîrepeat physical exams when the child is quiet, and observation, can be key to solidifying the diagnosis.  Imaging tools include plain radiographs, lateral decubitus film to r/o free air, and ultrasonography with color duplex imaging.  Fluoroscopic enema is the examination of choice for definitive diagnosis and first-line therapy.  
Plain radiographs are only 50% sensitive for the diagnosis, but can be extremely helpful in noting dilation of bowel, free air (perforation), and the extent of fluid in the bowel, if any, which can be a sign of serious obstruction.  U/S is highly sensitive and specific (almost 100% for both).  A ‚Äúbullseye‚Äù or ‚Äúdoughnut‚Äù lesion may be seen, which indicates one part of the bowel is telescoped into another.  Color duplex imaging can differentiate ischemic from perfused bowel.  CT may occasionally be performed if the diagnosis is still unclear at this point.
Treatment options include reduction under fluoroscopy (via air enema or hydrostatic water-soluble contrast enema), and surgery.  Assuming the patient has not perforated and is clinically stable, reduction has been noted to be successful 75-90% of the time.  There is debate, however, over whether air is superior to liquid contrast.  Air is considered safer, as it is less harmful if the patient perforates during the attempted reduction; there is also less radiation exposure to the patient.  The experience and comfort level of the radiologist performing the procedure is certainly a major factor when considering outcome.  If fluoroscopic enema reduction fails, then surgery should be considered.  It should be stated that early surgical consultation is prudent in these cases.
