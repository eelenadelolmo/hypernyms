None for embolized brachytherapy seeds.
Axial CT images show short linear metallic densities in left upper and lower lobes.  AP pelvis radiograph shows left acetabulum, superior pubic ramus and inferior pubic ramus fractures as well as numerous radiopaque  brachytherapy seeds over the prostate.
Brachytherapy seed embolization
• Calcification
• Embolization of Mercury
• Embolization of Heavy Metal
• Embolization of Brachytherapy seeds
79 year old man struck by vehicle as a pedestrian.  Now has hip pain.  Past medical history of prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy.
This case documents the unusual occurrence of hematogenous embolization of prostate brachytherapy "seeds".  In addition, there are fractures of the pelvis, from the accident.  Here is a related case of seed embolization:  http://rad.usuhs.edu/medpix/tf_case.html?&imageid=19858&pt_id=7099&topic_id=5654&quiz=no

NOTE:  Because the pubic rami and acetabulum form a bony ring - there must be more than one fracture, as seen here with both pubic rami broken.
