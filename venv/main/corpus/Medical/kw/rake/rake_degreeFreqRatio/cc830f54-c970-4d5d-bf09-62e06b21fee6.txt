Ulcers were noted around the right root.
Last Hgb A1C was elevated at 7.6.
Rheumatoid factor was negative.
ESR slightly elevated at 41.
Immobilization with a non-weight bearing total contact cast is the initial treatment until joint stability is confirmed both clinically and radiographically.  After treatment, ankle-foot arthrosis may be used for 12-18 months or indefinitely for disease in the ankle and hindfoot.  Extra-depth footwear and custom total contact orthotics can be used for disease in the midfoot and forefoot.
Three views of the right foot demonstrate medial subluxation of the midfoot on the hindfoot along Chopart's joint.  The bones demonstrate a mottled appearance with respect to their mineralization.  Small osteophytes are present at the metatarsophalangeal joint of the first phalanx.  Numerous osteophytes are along the bones of the midfoot and hindfoot.  An enthesophyte is present along the inferior aspect of the calcaneus.  An anterior ankle effusion is present.  Vascular calcifications are in the soft tissues.  No acute fracture lucencies are appreciated.

The patient has a long history of Diabetes Mellitus and foot ulcers.  She presented complaining of worsening right foot pain and swelling.
In this case, the patient has decreased bone mineralization along with bony debris, joint disorganization, joint distention, and subluxation along Chopart's joint.  These findings are consistent with a combined hypertrophic and atrophic neuropathic joint.  Approximately 40% of neuropathic joints fit this pattern.  Only 20% of neuropathic joints are purely hypertrophic, and the remaining 40% are purely atrophic.  The decreased bone density seen in this case is typical for diabetic patients.  As in this case, almost all neuropathic joints demonstrate large effusions.  The ankle and foot are the most common areas affected by neuropathic arthropathy in diabetics.  The most frequent location for this disease is the tarsal-metatarsal (Lisfranc) joint.  This case was slightly different because Chopart's joint was the primary joint affected.  Within the foot, Chopart's joint is the joint space between the talus and calcaneus posteriorly and the navicular and cuboid bones anteriorly.  The disease process in this case can also be described as a Diabetic Charcot joint.  The term Charcot's joint was originally used to describe a neuropathic joint arising from tabes dorsalis or neurosyphilis.
