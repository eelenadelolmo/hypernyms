Flattening of the bilateral hemidiaphragms (lateral view)
Increased AP diameter (lateral view)
Increased retrosternal clear space (lateral view)
Large lung volumes (AP view)
Emphysema
Emphysema
long smoking history and chronic shortness of breath
This case represents the importance of assessing the lateral chest radiograph.  Although sometimes overlooked, the lateral chest radiograph is critical in reliably assessing the changes of emphysema.
