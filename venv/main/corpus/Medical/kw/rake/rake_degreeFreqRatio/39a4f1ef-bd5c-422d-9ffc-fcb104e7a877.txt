radiographs taken approximately one month apart demonstrate vigorous callous formation at the fracture lines.
Radiographs of the left humerus demonstrate a spiral fracture of the distal diaphysis with mild shortening and some lateral displacemnt.  Callus formation is noted.  There is a lucent lesion associated within the fracture line.
Nonossifying Fibroma
pathologic fracture through a:
Unicameral bone cyst
nonossifying fibroma
eosinophilic granuloma
fibrous dysplasia
infection
!4 year old male with trauma to the left arm.
Nonossifying fibromas are usually asymptomatic but they can present with pathologic fractures through the lesions as in the case of this patient.
