Straight leg raise to 55° on left with report of lower back pain extending down left lower extremity to calf, from lower back extending down right lower extremity to the great toe 
Extensor and flexor halluces muscle strength normal 

Hypomobility noted at C2 left, C3 right, T2 right, T6 left, T8-9 posterior, and sacrum base. Muscle spasm was noted over the cervicothoracic and lumbar regions paraspinally. Pain/tenderness, abnormal range of motion, and tissue/tone changes were associated with areas of hypomobility.

According to NIOSH Static Strength Testing, the patient fell at 12th percentile for arm, and <10th percentile for high near, high far, floor, and leg.

EMG findings:
Increased insertional activity in the right biceps brachii as well as large amplitude motor unit potentials with increased durations and polyphasic morphology isolated in the right biceps brachii as well as right pronator teres muscles.  Active subacute right C6 radiculopathy causally related to the MVA, evidence of reinnervation present.
Chiropractic care to aid treatment of the neuromusculoskeletal components for relief of pain and discomfort.  NSAIDs given in a continuous fashion at a dose sufficient to control pain and stiffness. Suggestion has also been made that this type of NSAID regimen decelerates radiographic progression of Ankylosing Spondylitis over 2 years. 
The TNF blockers Infliximab, Etanercept, and Adalimumab are a mainstay of treatment, with strong evidence indicating an improvement in pain, function, and disease progression after use of TNF blockers. 
Patient will be monitored every 3 months to assess for improvement in clinical symptomatology and disease progression while on TNF blockers. He will continue chiropractic therapy and interval assessment of strength using the NIOSH strength testing protocol.

Patient is a 68 y/o African American male with a past medical history of glaucoma, motor vehicle accident, hypertension, and coronary artery disease s/p stent placement 5 years ago. He presented to the chiropractic office one month following the MVA. The patient was a passenger in a moving vehicle passing through an intersection. Another vehicle collided into the passenger side door of the patient's vehicle, pushing the door into the patient. The patient reported immediate back and neck pain following the collision. He was seated facing forward with his seatbelt on. There was no airbag deployment. He denied any loss of consciousness or overt bleeding. A workup at Kenmore Mercy Hospital revealed a hairline fracture of the right hip per the patient, with no necessary intervention at the time. 
Currently, the patient is complaining of neck pain and stiffness, with pain radiating from the right neck down to the right pointer finger. He also reports low back pain that radiates down the bilateral legs, to the toes on the right and to the calf on the left. The pain is continuous in nature. He rates both the neck and back pain a 7/10 in severity. He reports great difficulty in completing daily tasks such as making his bed, reaching for items above his head, bending down to tie his shoes, and walking more than a short distance. The pain and stiffness have severely affected his life. He denies any bowel or bladder incontinence.

Lab values obtained revealed an mild increase in ESR, anemia, negative for the HLA-B27 gene, mildly elevated AST, and proteinuria (41.4mg/dl) with a Creatinine of 1.34 (baseline unknown).

Due to anemia with proteinuria, a skull X-ray was obtained which revealed no osteolytic lesions.
This case represents an incidental finding of Ankylosing Spondylitis in a 68 y/o African American male after workup for a motor vehicle accident. Ankylosing Spondylitis typically presents as inflammatory low back pain, that being low back pain which is worse in the morning and improves throughout the day. Approximately 80% of patients develop first symptoms at less than 30 years of age (2), though our patient apparently was asymptomatic until his motor vehicle accident. Also, patients 40% of the time are HLA-B27 positive, which is not the case for our patient. The purpose of our case was to delineate which symptoms are a result of trauma vs. Ankylosing Spondylitis. Firstly, the patient reports being clinically asymptomatic until the accident. In addition, his EMG data indicates that his right arm pain and right second digit numbness is indeed secondary to an active C6 radiculopathy of a subacute nature, providing strong evidence that the likely etiology is the recent trauma from the motor vehicle accident as opposed to an insidious inflammatory spondyloarthritis. On exam, the patient also has bilateral upper extremity weakness and severe restriction of cervical neck range of motion. Though the imaging suggests ankylosis of the cervical levels C2-T1, the patient reports that his neck stiffness and pain began after his accident and he denies any of these symptoms previous to the accident. Gunduz et al. conducted a study assessing nerve conduction studies in patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis. They reported a significant number of patients (40.6%) whom were initially asymptomatic at the start of the study who developed electrophysiologically proven peripheral nerve involvement (3) over time. Proposed mechanisms include instability of vertebrae, inflammation, and compression of the neural structures by ossified interspinous ligaments or foraminal stenosis. Though our patient had evidence of ossified interspinous ligaments, the subacute onset of our patient’s radiculopathy is in direct contradiction to what would be a more chronic inflammatory process. Although our patient’s Ankylosing Spondylitis did not necessarily directly cause the current radiculopathy, it is likely that given the increase in spinal rigidity in Ankylosing Spondylitis patients, our patient was predisposed to such an injury given the neural traction component involved in cervical flexion. Given his absence of disc hernitation and no obvious increase in compressive deformity at the C5-C6 level a physical cause for his radiculopathy may be unlikely. It is possible that during the accident, the patient sustained a neuropraxia of the C6 nerve given the amount of foraminal stenosis already present, precipitating a persistent sensory loss of that nerve distribution. Bersen et al. reported that patients with cervical neck trauma and resultant neuropraxia were much more likely to have a predisposition due to canal stenosis (1), indicating a potential increase in neuropraxia risk in patients with narrowing of spinal foramina. 

Clinically, the patient continues to complain of right neck pain that radiates down his right arm in to his right second digit. He also complains of severe low back pain with associated radiculopathy down his bilateral lower extremities that limits his activities of daily living. We will continue interval assessment of strength via NIOSH static strength testing as he progresses through his treatment for Ankylosing Spondylitis along with chiropractic manipulation.
