Patient is currently being treated conservatively with pain meds as needed.
MRI of the spine demonstrates proliferation of the dorsal epidural fat associated with complete effacement of the dorsal sub arachnoid space from the T3 - T9 levels which results in moderate central canal stenosis mild ventral cord flattening at the T6-7 level.  There is also multilevel disk disease.
