Decreased perineal sensation.
Neurosurgical extraction of the sequestered disk
Image 1 is a sagittal T2 weighted MRI of the lumbar spine demonstrating a low signal structure compressing the cauda equina posterior to the superior sacrum
Image 2 is an axial T-2 weighted image at the level upper sacrum demonstrating the low signal structure in the axial plane
Image 3 is the same axial image with arrows pointing out the pertinent finding
Image 4 is a magnified view of the sagittal image with arrows 
Image 5 demonstrates the utility of the cross-referencing function of a PACS.
L5-S1 disk herniation with sequestered disk material in the spinal canal, compressing the cauda equina and causing myelopathic symptoms
L5-S1 Disk extrusion/sequestered disk with compression of cauda equina

Other extradural spinal lesions, much less likely in light of patient's history:
Spinal canal meningioma
Spinal canal schwannoma
Spinal canal neurofibroma
Chordoma
Dural or extradural metastatic disease (e.g. lymphoma)
Spinal AVM
Osteochondroma
Patient heard his lower back "pop" during exercise. Within a few hours, he developed decreased sensation in his groin and urinary incontinence.
To define the disk material as sequestered (free fragment within the spinal canal) required the demonstration that the fragment was not contiguous with the parent disk. Scrolling through the images in the sagittal and axial planes revealed that the extruded disk material was, indeed, not attached to the parent disk.
