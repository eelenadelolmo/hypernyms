Texto: 
Physical exam is remarkable for light bibasilar crackles.
Pulmonary function testing is siginificant for a restrictive pattern of pulmonary pathology.
No treatment is necesary as it is a sequelae of trauma or infection.
Chest radiograph shows a diffuse linear interstitial pattern with an air-filled cystic structure with no internal vascular markings and surrounded by a well-circumscribed, thin, regular wall in the left lung.
Lung Windows CT scan shows a reticular interstital pattern with minimal ground glass attenuation and the presence of a thin-walled cystic structure laterally, at the level of the left pulmonary artery.
Pneumatocele
Post-traumatic pneumatocele 
Infectious pneumatocele
Bronchogenic cyst 
Cystic adenomatoid malformation
Bullae
Pneumonia
53 year old male with progressively increasing dyspnea along with history of inhalation injury during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
