Chest X-Ray: Gas bubbles in the chest
Diaphragmatic Rupture
Traumatic Diaphragmatic Rupture

Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia

Large Hiatal Hernia
67-year-old admitted to the Trauma Service through the ED, Level 1 response.Â  He was unrestrained driver, MVA, with complaints of SOB, back pain, left hip pain, hemodynamically stable upon arrival, heart rate in the 70s, blood pressure of 200/100.
In most instances careful examination of adequate chest roentgenograms will suffice.
 To add diagnostic efficacy, this can be repeated after the passage of a radiopaque nasogastric tube or simple contrast studies of the upper gastrointestinal tract. 
In the present review diagnosis on the basis of the chest roentgenogram was made in 40.7% of the cases. 
Diagnostic signs, either pathognomonic or suggestive on chestroentgenogram, are as follows:
Gas bubbles in the chest (seen on this film)Nasogastric tube in the chest 
Positive Gastrografin study 

SUGGESTIVE
	Irregularity of the diaphragmatic outline	Elevated diaphragm 
	Mediastinal shift without pulmonary or 	intrapleural cause
        Compression atelectasis of the lower lobe
