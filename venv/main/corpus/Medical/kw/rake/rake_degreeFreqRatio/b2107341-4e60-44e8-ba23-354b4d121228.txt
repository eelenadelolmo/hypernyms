Texto: 
Palpable mass in the left upper abdomen.
The patient underwent preoperative chemotherapy to shrink the primary tumor before nephrectomy.
A large heterogeneous mass fills the left abdomen on abdominal radiograph.  

On CT, a rim of renal tissue can be seen around the anterior medial aspect of the mass which represents a claw sign.

On US, the mass is large and heterogeneous with prominent vascular flow.
Wilms Tumor
Based on the plain film findings:
Wilms
Neuroblastoma
Splenomegaly from any cause such as lymphoma
Increasing abdominal size.
