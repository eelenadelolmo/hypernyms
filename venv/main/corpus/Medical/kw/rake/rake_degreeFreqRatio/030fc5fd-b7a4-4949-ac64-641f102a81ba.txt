Surgical resection.
Sagital T1W pre-gad images demonstrates a well circumscribed, isointense, extra-axial cerebellopontine angle mass.
Coronal T2W image again shows the mass to be slightly increased in signal in comparison to the surrounding brain tissue.
Axial T1W post-gad image demonstrate a homogenously enhancing mass.
Cerebellopontine angle meningioma - path proven
1. Meningioma
2. Accoustic Schwanoma
3. Neuroepithelial cysts
27 year old female with many month long history of headache.  No other significant medical history.
