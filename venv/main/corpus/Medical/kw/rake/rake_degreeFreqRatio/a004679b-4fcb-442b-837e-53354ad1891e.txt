MRA demonstrates hypoplastic right A1 segment of ACA.  This is a conjenital variant and should be differentiated from dissection/occlusion of the vessel.

Right A1 segment is not seen on a collapsed MIP image.  Source images demonstrate string like signal compatible with A1 segment hypoplasia and not complete abscence.

Left ACA is of approximately the same size as left MCA.  Right ICA is smaller than the left.  This fingings confirm that the fingings related to the string like flow in right A1 are secondary to congenital hypoplastic A1. 
In the case of dissection or partial occlusion, both ICAs would likely be of the same size.  Additionally, contraleteral (left) A1 segment would be smaller than adjacent M1 segment.
Hypoplastic A1 segment of ACA
Dissection
Partial occlusion (in case of hypoplastic A1)
Total occlusion (in case of conjenitally absent A1).
30 year old male was admitted to the hospital after motor-vehicle accident.  Initial CT of the head demonstrated area suspicion for an aneurism.  MRI and MRA of the brain was performed to evaluate further.
