asymptomatic
Neurosurgical consult to evaluate for excision
MR

- 3.5 cm extra-axial, middle cranial fossa mass with layering material and signal characteristics consistent with lipid.  Dependent, non-enhancing debris is seen more inferiorly with signal characteristics consistent with blood or proteinaceous material.  There is no restricted diffusion.  Mass effect is noted at the right anterior temporal tip without significant midline shift suggestive of a chronic evolution.
Intracranial Dermoid Inclusion Cyst
â€¢ Dermoid Inclusion Cyst
â€¢ Epidermoid Inclusion Cyst
â€¢ Teratoid tumor
23 y.o. man presents for follow up evaluation of an asymptomatic mass originally diagnosed as intracranial lipoma as a child.
The patient was asymptomatic but consulted to neurosurgery for evaluation for excision due to the potential risk of rupture possibly causing chemical meningitis.
