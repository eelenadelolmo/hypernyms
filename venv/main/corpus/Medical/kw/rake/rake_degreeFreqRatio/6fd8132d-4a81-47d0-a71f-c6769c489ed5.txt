Osteochondral bodies can be treated conservatively unless they are causing increasing pain or limitation in joint function, for which they can be removed with arthroscopic techniques.
No prior study for comparison.  AP, lateral, and tunnel radiographs of the knees show a 14 x 19 x 24 mm calcified loose body in the midpopliteal region of the right knee. Other findings are mild osteoarthritic changes, right greater than left, predominantly in the medial compartments with degenerative spurring, mainly at the medial tibial margin and tibial spine of the right knee.  No appreciable joint space asymmetry was seen on non-weight bearing radiographs.
