MRI/MRA was recommended to delineate venous return.
A well circumscribed soft tissue mass is evident in the posterior left lower lobe adjacent to the spinal column which has normal appearing vertebral foramina.  In addition, vessels originating from the thoracic aorta are present coursing into the mass.  The diaphragm is normal.  No airways are visualized in the lesion.  There is no mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

Not shown, the liver was normal.  The thoracic abnormality was an incidental finding.
