Exam in the emergency room was limited due to the patient’s knee being locked in extension.  Exam under anesthesia revealed full passive range of motion of the right knee.  2+ Lachman test, 2+ posterior drawer, 2+ gross varus instability with minimal posterolateral corner rotatory instability.  Negative valgus instability.
Treatment included surgical repair of the PCL and reconstruction of the ACL and PLC.  Upon completion of surgical treatment, the patient's leg was placed in a brace locked in full extension and the patient was made protected weight bearing for a period of 4 weeks, after which passive range of motion exercises were allowed to be performed.
Imaging showed right ACL tear, PCL tear, and PLC injury.
Right knee multi-ligamentous injury: lateral collateral ligament; popliteus tendon; popliteofemoral ligament; anterior cruciate ligament; and, posterior cruciate ligament.
Combined posterolateral corner (PLC) and cruciate ligament (ACL/PCL) injury
Isolated PLC injury
ACL tear
PCL tear
LCL tear
27 year old man who presented to the emergency room with right knee pain after slipping and hyper-extending his knee while running outside.  The patient noted immediate onset of pain and instability of his right knee.  He was unable to bear weight thereafter, and endorsed paresthesias to the dorsum of his foot.
Posterolateral corner (PLC) knee injuries are seen in approximately 7-16% of all knee ligament injuries, but are not usually seen in isolation.  Although statistics reported by different studies vary, the most recent studies show that up 8% of knee ligamentous injuries may be due to isolated PLC injury.  Most commonly one or both of the cruciate ligaments will also be involved in the injury.  It is important as a physician to not miss the diagnosis of PLC injury, as it is a common cause of ACL reconstruction failure.  Thus, any patient who presents with an ACL tear should also be evaluated for possible PLC injury.

The PLC consists of both static and dynamic structures.  The static structures include the lateral collateral ligament, the popliteus tendon, the popliteofibular ligament, and the lateral capsule.  The static structures lie on the lateral side of the knee, deep to the dynamic structures, which include the biceps femoris, the iliotibial tract, and the lateral head of the gastrocnemius.  Injuries to the PLC most commonly occur due to a blow to the anteromedial knee, hyperextension of the knee, and/or knee dislocation.  Common associated injuries include damage to the common peroneal nerve in 15-29% of patients, as well as vascular injury.

Grade 1 and 2 injuries may be managed non-operatively by placing the knee in full extension with protected weight bearing for 2 weeks and a return to sports in approximately 8 weeks.  However, patients with Grade 3 injuries should be referred to orthopedic surgery for consultation, as studies have shown that up to 50% of patients with Grade 3 injuries who are treated non-operatively develop osteoarthritic radiographic changes in both medial and lateral compartments.  Surgical treatment should focus on reconstruction of PLC as opposed to repair, as repair has a failure rate of 37% vs 9% for reconstruction.  Although different reconstruction techniques exist, recent studies show that anatomic reconstruction of PLC yields better outcomes, with improved varus and external rotation laxity as well as less restriction to range of motion exercises postoperatively.

Classifications:
Grade 1: 0-5 mm of lateral opening; minimal ligament disruption
Grade 2: 5-10 mm of lateral opening; moderate ligament disruption
Grade 3: >10 mm of lateral opening; severe ligament disruption with no endpoint
