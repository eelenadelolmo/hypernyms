Patient will undergo further testing with urology.
Normal right kidney.  Normal bladder.  Left kidney with multiple non-communicating cysts throughout the cortex is noted.  Hydronephrosis of the left collecting system is seen as well. No dilation of the ureters is seen.
Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney Disease
Reflux nephropathy
UPJ Obstruction
Multicystic dysplastic kidney disease
Early onset Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
Severe hydronephrosis with cystic dysplasia of the kidney
8d yo male for follow-ip from prenatal ultrasound demonstrating pelviectasis in the left kidney.
At this age, the differential includes Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease, Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney Disease, and Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease.  

ARPKD is a possibility, but with a normal right kidney, this differential is unlikely as this disease is bilateral and usually fatal.  Early onset ADPKD is a possibility and cannot be excluded at this time.  The leading diagnosis is MCDKD â€“ a single dysplastic, nonfunctioning kidney filled with non-communicating cysts.  In approximately 15-20% of this disease, hydronephrosis will be present on either the ipsilateral or contralateral side.  In time, the left kidney will become atrophied
