Multiple palpable lesions in the chest wall
The patient's right CFA was percutaneously accessed, and a thoracic aortogram was performed which demonstrated normal caliber to the thoracic aorta, but filling of abnormal tortuous, hypertrophied intercostal arteries at every level. 

A large right posterior chest wall draining vein was also noted (which was the site of bleeding).  Hence, ultrasound was used to access the enlarged vein, and multiple 15mm and 10mm 038 embolization coils (soaked in thrombin) were placed.
Enhanced chest CT images demonstrate multiple enhancing tubular structures (presumably vascular) in the chest wall, multiple round calcifications (suggestive of phleboliths), rib anomalies, and a large enhancing mass in the left superior chest wall, extending into the left chest cavity.
Chest Wall Hemangiomas (Hemangiomatosis)
• Chest wall hemangiomas / AVMs
• Angiosarcomas
• Hypervascular metastatic lesions
71 y.o. woman with a past history of multiple large vascular lesions throughout her body.  She was being assessed for sclerotherapy in clinic when her right chest wall lesion began to bleed.  Direct pressure failed to stop the bleeding, and the patient was taken directly to interventional radiology (IR) for catheter angiography.
