Physical exam and labs were normal.showed right sided abdominal pain.  CBC was normal.  Urinalysis showed microhematuria.
Cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for cholecystitis.
Non-contrast axial CT shows enlarged gall bladder with heterogenous attenuation.  Contrast CT shows multiple septations within the body of the gall bladder.  Right upper quadrant ultrasound shows thickened gall bladder wall with a shadowing stone.
Acute calculous cholecystitis
For CT findings:

Acute calculous cholecystitis
Acute acalculous cholecystitis
Chronic cholecystitis (cholesteroloses)
Gall bladder carcinoma
77 year-old man with right upper quadrant pain and microhematuria.
Because this patient was a poor surgical candidate due to comorbid conditions, he was taken to the Interventional Radiology suite where a percutaneous cholecystostomy was performed.  This is a recurring problem for him, he underwent the same procedure 10 months before this admission with a good outcome
