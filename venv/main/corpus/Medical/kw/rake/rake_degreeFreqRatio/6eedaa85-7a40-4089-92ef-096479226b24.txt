Treatment depends on the circumstances surrounding the patient with local resections as necessary for mechanical problems.  These patients should be observed for sarcomatous transformation.
Radiographs of the right knee, tibia, and fibula show multiple exostoses.  Multiple broad based sessile exostoses are present at the metaphyses of the distal femur, proximal tibia, and distal tibia. The exostoses have cortical and medullary continuity with the adjacent normal bone.  Additionally, the exostoses at the distal femur and proximal tibia produce an Erlenmyer flask appearance simulating osseous dysplasia.
