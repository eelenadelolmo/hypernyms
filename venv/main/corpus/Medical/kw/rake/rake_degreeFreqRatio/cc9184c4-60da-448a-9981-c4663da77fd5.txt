Texto: 
Increased signal intensity and widening of the optic nerves as they track posteriorly.
There is a well circumscribed 1.5X1cm mass of high signal intensity located at the location of the optic chiasm.  The lesion is suprasellar.
Bilateral Optic Gliomas
Meningioma 
Optic glioma 
Sarcoid
Optic neuritis
Metastasis
Lymphoma/leukemia
The patient presented with a history of slowly progressive decreased visual acuity.
