21yo female with vauge, intermittent crampy abdominal pain.  Negative RUQ ultrasound.  No bowel changes.
Hounsfield units is c/w simple fluid.  No increased attenuation to suggest pyogenic process or blood.  No enhancement to suggest abscess.  Location and morphology c/w hydrosalpinx.  If this were infected, would expect more profound exam and labs.
