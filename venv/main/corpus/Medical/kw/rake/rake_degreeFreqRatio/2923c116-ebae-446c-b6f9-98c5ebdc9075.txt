Showed hypertelorism of the eyes.
Surgical exploration and resection
IV amphotericin B
Long-term itraconazole

Follow-up is with otorhinolaryngology, with repeat culture of nasal discharge and radiologic studies
• Image 1: Axial CT with expansion and opacification of frontal sinus, with marked thinning and disruption of bone comprising the inner table of the frontal bone
• Image 2: Axial CT with expansion of ethmoid sinus, with disruption of bone comprising the left lamina papyracea
• Image 3: Coronal CT with expansion of all paranasal sinuses, with extradural extension into the anterior cranial fossa and extraconal extension into the left orbit
• Image 4: T1 MRI with heterogeneous signal in the frontal sinuses without changes to the frontal lobe of the brain
• Image 5: T2 MRI with extradural expansion of heterogeneous mass into the anterior cranial fossa
Chronic Fungal Sinusitis
• Sinus neoplasm
• Chronic bacterial sinusitis
• Allergic fungal sinusitis
• Acute fungal sinusitis
• Chronic fungal sinusitis
• Granulomatous fungal sinusitis
• Sinus mycetoma
Patient presented after a 9-month cruise - his parents did not recognize his face.  His nose was bigger and his eyes were farther apart than they remembered.  He complained of slight frontal headaches, but had no other symptoms.
The patient had not noticed the cosmetic effects on his face of the expanding sinonasal fungal ball; nor did his coworkers aboard the ship.  It was only after he saw that his parents did not recognize him that anyone realized that his face had changed shape.  This may be due to the slowly progressive changes.
