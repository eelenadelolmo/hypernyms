Normal appearing newborn male.
Flattening of the calyces, with dilatation of the collecting system, and ureter tortuosity.
Grade V vesicoureteral reflux
None
Newborn male with agenesis of the left kidney and pelvi-ureterectasis seen on ultrasound.
Renal agenesis is more common on the left side. The rate of unilateral agenesis is approximately 1:1100.
Contralateral kidney is usually normal, however abnormalities of the contralteral collecting system are not uncommon. Incidence of vesicoureteral reflux is 30%.

20-30% of individuals with VACTERL association will have unilateral renal agenesis. VACTERL is an acronym for Vertebral anomalies, imperforate Anus, Cardiac anamolies, Tracheoesophageal fistula, Esophageal atresia, Renal, and Limb anomalies.

No additional congenital anomalies were appreciated on followup examinations of this patient.
