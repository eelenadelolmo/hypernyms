Elevated liver enzymes
Patient was re-listed on transplant list; she subsequently underwent a second liver transplant.
Initial ultrasound images demonstrate hyperechoic appearance to the bile ducts.  The hepatic artery Duplex Doppler reveals a "parvus-tarus" appearance suggestive of hepatic artery stenosis.  Follow-up CT imaging demonstates low attenuation, irregular expanded appearance of the bile ducts.  Percutaneous cholangiogram demonstrates an irregular appearance to the biliary tree with leakage of contrast from the normal confines of the duct.
Biliary Necrosis from hepatic artery thrombosis
Biliary necrosis from ischemic cholangitis
Necrotizing infectious cholangitis
Sclerosing or AIDS cholangitis
History of liver transplant 3 years prior; she presents with worsening hepatic function.
