On exam, the patient presented with no dysmorphic features.  His height and weight were within normal limits for age.  No focal cranial nerve defecits were identified and the fundoscopic exam was normal.  The HEENT exam was significant for a 9.5 X 6 cm soft tissue lesion over the left parietal area which was mildly tender and fluctulant upon palpation.  The overlying skin was reported to have a peau de aurange-like appearance (orange peel).  The left auricle was somewhat externally rotated due to the mass.  There was also a 4 X 4 cm firm posterior auricular node just inferior to the above described swelling.  No further cervical, supraclavicular, subclavicular, or axiallary lymphadenopathy was appreciated. No evidence of skin rashes or markers to suggest a neurocutaneous syndrome were identified.  The remainder of the physical exam was within normal limits.

Pertinent Lab Work included:
CBC Within normal limits
ESR 39 mm/hr
CRP 2.57 mg/dl
LDH  141 units/liter
Fibrinogen  526 mg/dl
PT/PTT  Within normal limits
The patient was referred to the Hematology/Oncology clinic and received three doses of Vinblastine and Prednisone.  The patient experienced marked diminution in the size and tenderness of the scalp/skull lesion.  The patient continues to do well and follows up regularly for care of the soft tissue wound with the Hematology/Oncology team.
Image #1:  Lateral view of the skull demonstrates a solitary lytic lesion lying within the parietal region.  No evidence of sclerotic margins are seen.

Image #2:  Frontal view of the skull deomonstrates a left sided solitary lytic lesion accompanied by marked soft tissue swelling.

Image #3:  Noncontrast axial CT of head, viewed under bone windows, demonstrates evidence of a soft tissue mass within the left parietal region with resultant erosion of the left parietal bone.  Slight beveling of the edges of the bony defect is suggested.

Image #4:  Noncontrast axial CT of head, viewed under brain windows, again demonstrates evidence of bony erosion of the left parietal bone caused by a large heterogeneous soft tissue mass with a small central area of high density suggestive of hemorrhage.  A minimal amount of mass effect upon the underlying brain parenchyma is seen.

Image #5:  Unenhanced axial T1WI of the brain demonstrates evidence of a large soft tissue mass with erosion of the left parietal bone.  The lesion appears to be of slightly lesser intensity as compared to the surrounding brain parenchyma.  Again slight effacement of the underlying brain parenchyma is appreciated.

Image #6:  Postcontrast axial T1WI of the brain demonstrates the large soft tissue mass causing destructive changes within the left parietal bone.  The lesion appears to be heterogeneous and exhibits peripheral enhancement which suggests the presence of a necrotic center.  There is dural enhancement without underlying dural invasion.

Image #7:  Postcontrast coronal T1WI of the brain again demonstrates the large soft tissue mass causing destructive changes within the left parietal bone.  The lesion appears to be heterogeneous and exhibits peripheral enhancement suggesting the presence of a necrotic center.  There is dural enhancement without underlying dural invasion and minimal mass effect is again seen.

     (ed 3)  New York:  Springer-Verlag, 1993.
12 year old caucasian male with history of Asperger’s Syndrome and no familial history of malignancy presents complaining of swelling above his left ear over the past three weeks.  The swelling was accompanied by low grade fevers around 99 degrees Fareinheit.  There were no subjective complaints of headache, weight loss, or night sweats.  After continued growth while being treated with antibiotics, further work-up was initiated by the patient's primary care physician and diagnostic imaging studies were obtained.
This patient showed dramatic response to chemotherapy with nearly complete resolution of the tumor mass.
