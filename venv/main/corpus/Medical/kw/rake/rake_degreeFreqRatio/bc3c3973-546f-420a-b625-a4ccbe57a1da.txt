Palpable hard region on anterior left mandibular body
Lesion resected and bone packing / reconstruction hardware placed
Axial CT images demonstrate an aggressive expansile lesion in the anterior left mandible body; the mass appears solid.
Ameloblastoma

Odontogenic keratocyst
Central giant cell granuloma
Metastatic disease
Expanding mandibular "bump" on left front of jaw; referred for CT by dentist
An ameloblast is the precursor cell to an enamel producing cell.  However, most ameloblastomas are not dense lesions containing enamel.  Most occur between 20-40 years of age, and about 80% are expansible multilocular lucent lesions.
They can occasionally have central calcification (fig 3).
Most (80%) occur in the mandible, with the remaining (20%) occuring in the maxilla.  In spite of surgical removal,
recurrence can be fairly high (up to 25%).
