Wheezing on exam
Patient received a full skeletal survey one week later which demonstrated no lesion in the right ribs or any other lesions.  Although non-accidnetal trauma is the leading diagnosis, this cannot be proven at this time.
Single PA view of the chest demonstrates clear lungs and normal cardiothymic silhouette.  Normal vasculature. However, there is a lesion in the right posterior seventh rib at the costovertebral junction.
Non accidental trauma vs artifact
Fracture
Round pneumonia
Overlap of normal structures
Lung nodule
6 month old male presents with wheezing for 1 week.
