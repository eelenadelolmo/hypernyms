Non-tender mobile mass in area of left triceps.
No treatment.
An intramuscular lesion is seen in the medial head of the triceps with intermediate signal intensity with slightly higher than muscle signal on T1 sequences with very high signal on T2 sequences with central areas of low signal consistent with flow voids. Post gadolinium sequences demonstrate serpentine vascular pattern. Images of the shoulder demonstate a similar lesion in the subcutaneous fat over the rotator cuff.
Intramuscular Hemangioma
Hemangioma
Angiosarcoma
Rhabdosarcoma
43 year old woman with nontender left upper arm mass, present for >3 years.
Multiple soft tissue hemangiomas suggest hemagiomatosis whih is rare in a patient of this age. Presenting this late, this is not likely syndromic.
