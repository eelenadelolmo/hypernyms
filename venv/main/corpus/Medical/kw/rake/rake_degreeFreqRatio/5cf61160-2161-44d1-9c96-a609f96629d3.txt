Lateral and posterior elbow swelling.  Lateral tenderness to palpation.
On initial presentation the identification of the anterior and posterior fat pads is highly sensitive for a fracture.  In an adult, statistically this is a radial head or radial neck fracture.  If no fracture is identified, the elbow should be splinted and a follow up exam done in 1 week as in this case.  MRI can be performed but will not change management.
Multiple views of the left elbow demonstrate normal bone mineralization.  There is an anterior fat pad (spinninaker sail sign) and s posterior fat pad visible.  A definitive fracture is not visualized on the initial radiographs.  Follow up radiographs 1 week later clearly demonstrate an intra-articular non displaced linear radial head fracture on the radial head-capitellum view.
