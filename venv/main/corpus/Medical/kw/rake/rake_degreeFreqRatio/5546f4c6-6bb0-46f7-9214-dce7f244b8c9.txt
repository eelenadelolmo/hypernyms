Antiobiotics.  Papillary necrosis and cortical scarring can occur with incompletely treated or aggressive infections.
CT axial images show a striated nephrogram with bands of alternating high and low attenuation.
Acute Pyelonephritis
Ureteric obstruction
Contusion
Renal vein thrombosis
Tubular obstruction
Hypotension
Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease
Presented with fever, dysuria, left flank pain, and increased urination.
Unilateral striations on a nephrogram caused by acute pyelonephritis are thought to result from increased interstitial edema.  In acute tubulointerstitial infection, the cellular inflammatory infiltrate increases parenchymal pressure within the affected medullary or cortical rays.  These areas show decreased enhancement due to the increased pressure.  On delayed imaging, the areas of decreased attenuation may have increased attenuation relative to the adjacent normal tissue.  This reversal is likely secondary to tubular stasis.  The urine and contrast take longer to enter and then linger in the obstructed collecting ducts.  The collecting ducts are obstructed by inflammatory cells.  This causes the increased attenuation on delayed images.  Other characteristics of pyelonephritis include perinephric stranding and a diffusely enlarged kidney.  There can also be thickening of Gerota’s fascia.  Pyonephrosis can also be present in which layering debri may be detected within the collecting systems.
