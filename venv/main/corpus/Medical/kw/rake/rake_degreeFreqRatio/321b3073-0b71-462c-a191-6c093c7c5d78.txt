Cuneonavicular Tarsal Coalition
Cuneonavicular Tarsal Coalition
pain with walking.
Cuneonavicular is a rare form of tarsal coalition.  In this case the patients diagnosis was missed on preliminary radiographic studies.  A high index of suspicion is required for patients presenting with mid-foot or hinfoot pain and clinical pes planus.  CT is the imaging modality of choice for patients with suspected tarsal coalition not demonstrated on radiographic imaging.
