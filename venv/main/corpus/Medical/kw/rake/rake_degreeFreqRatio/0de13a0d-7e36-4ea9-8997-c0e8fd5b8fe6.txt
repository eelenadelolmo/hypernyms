Plain Film:  Paucity of bowel gas in the abdomen with pathologic calcifications and metal densities in the shape of teeth.  
US: Large heterogeneous intraabdominal mass with apparent cystic and solid components.  Scattered echogenic structures with shadowing likely representing calcifications throughout the mass are noted.

CT: Large midline heterogenous mass with cystic and calcific components that does not appear to be originating from liver or kidney.  The ovaries are not easily identified.
Ovarian Germ Cell Tumor:  Mature Cystic Teratoma with Yolk Sac component.

11 yo girl with "failure to thrive".   The child has had increased hunger recently, but eats only small amounts at a time because she gets full quickly and her “belly aches”.  The mother stated that that the child had always had a round belly and also suffered from “low iron” for quite some time.
This patient had incomplete tumor resection and has been treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.  She has no progression of disease to date.
