Plain radiographs demonstrate a branching, lobular mass in the right middle lobe.

CT demonstrates multiple conglomerations of serpiginous contrast-filled vessels with large feeding artery and draining vein.

Post-procedural radiograph demonstrates the coil embolization.
Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformation
Malignancy
Granulomatous disease
Inflammation
Benign
Other congenital mass
36 yo woman with a recent CVA of unknown etiology with no known predisposing factors.
This patient was evaluated for possible Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, suggested multiple times by radiologists based on the pulmonary findings.  However there is no evidence of skin, liver, or brain AVMs.  She has had an MRI/MRA, which only demonstrated the stroke, there was no evidence of intracranial AVM.
