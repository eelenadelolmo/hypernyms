Texto: 
hyperreflexia both legs
none
MRI:
High signal changes in thoracic spinal cord on T2 images.
Punctate vascular structures noted on margins of cord.
Vascular Enhancement along cord borders.

CT myelogram:
Dilated vascular structures on surface of thoracic spinal cord
Spinal Dural Arteriovenous Fistula
Cord AVM
Hemangioblastoma
Multiple sclerosis
ADEM
82 year old male with one year history of progressive weakness in legs and spacticity
Spinal angiography failed to confirm diagnosis.
Due to patients age, renal status, and vascular disease all radicular arteries could not be catheterized. 

MRI of spine on this patient at outside hospital was interpreted as showing thoracic cord syrinx.
