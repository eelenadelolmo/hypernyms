Likely treatment will consist of chemotherapy and radiation. There was and currently is discussion of performing VATS in this case for further staging and potential treatment.

56 yo Female presents for screening x-ray. She is aymptomatic except for a mild cough and slight  fatigue for about one month.
Adenocarcinoma is the most common form of lung cancer in the US. It is associated with smoking although this less strongly than other types of lung cancer. Adenocarcinomas typically are well-defined masses that occur in a peripheral location. This type of lung cancer  is more common in women, usually occurring in current or former smokers although occasionally occurring in non-smokers.  Staging involves the TMN system with this patient at Stage IIIB based on a T4NoMo lesion (5 cm in size with mediastinal invasion).   Surgery is the treatment of choice for stage I and II lung adenocarcinoma. Stage III and IV adenocarcinoma is usually treated with chemotherapy and radiation although there select stage III and IV cancers may be amenable to surgical treatment.  Median survival for stage IIIB lung cancer is 12 months and 5-year surival is less than 5%.
