Texto: 
Coil embolization of the left gonadal vein including all collaterals without evidence of venous reflux into the varicocele on post-embolization venogram.
1. Large left gondal vein with reflux of contrast into a varicocele within the left scrotum with multiple collateral veins identified.
2. No evidence of reflux of contrast distal to the most proximal coils within the left gonadal vein and no collaterals visualized on postprocedure venogram.
Varicocele Embolization
Findings diagnostic for varicocele.
20 year old male with recurrent pain and scrotal enlargement status post left varicocele ligation 4 years ago.
Although technical success, as defined by relief of the patient's symptoms, are similar between surgical ligation and varicocele ligation, recurrence rates are generally higher after surgery.  This is likely a reflection of the greater ability of embolization to occlude existing collateral vessels.  In this patient whose varicocele recurred 4 years after ligation, multiple collateral vessels were identified and able to be embolized along the path of the gonadal vein.
