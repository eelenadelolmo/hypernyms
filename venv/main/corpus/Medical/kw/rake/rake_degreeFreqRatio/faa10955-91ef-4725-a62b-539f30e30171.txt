Unknown.
Knee athroscopy was planned.
The double PCL sign is associated with bucket-handle tears of the medial meniscus that occur in the presence of an intact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). A bucket-handle tear is a longitudinal tear of a meniscus that results in a displaced but attached meniscal fragment and may become displaced into the notch between the PCL and the medial tibial eminence in the midline, with the fragment orientated parallel to the PCL. The intact ACL serves as a barrier that prevents further lateral displacement of the meniscal fragment. The ACL is pivotal in the resulting alignment of the structures that are responsible for the depiction of the double PCL sign. Since ligaments and menisci demonstrate a hypointense signal with all pulse sequences, the displaced fragment will mimic a second PCL that is anterior and inferior to the true ligament, hence the name "double PCL sign" (Fig 1).
Bucket Handle Meniscal Tear of the Knee
None.
Soldier with increasing knee pain with clicking noted. Reports doing a lot of running and had a twisting fall while running about 6 months ago. Since then knee pain had been progressively getting worse.
