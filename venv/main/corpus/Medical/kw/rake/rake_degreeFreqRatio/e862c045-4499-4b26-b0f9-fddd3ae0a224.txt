Constitutional: She appears well-developed and well-nourished. She is active.
Nose: Firm mass on the left nasal ala, with obstruction of the left nasal airway. Mass measures 1-2 cm and extends toward cheek. No fluctuance. No changes in overlying skin.No mucosal edema, rhinorrhea, nasal discharge or congestion. No foreign body in the right nostril. No foreign body in the left nostril.
She has no cervical adenopathy.
Patient was given chemotherapy, radiation, and had surgical excision of mass.
Solid left nasal mass which enhances. Would favor a solid neoplasm such as
rhabdomyosarcoma.
Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma
Vascular anomaly (hemangioma) vs benign fibroma vs rhabdomyosarcoma vs dermoid
8 month old who was noted to have a bump on her left nostril about 3 months ago. The mass has grown fairly quickly otherwise. She has some mild nasal congestion and mouth breathing over the last few weeks. She is eating and gaining weight well. She was born at 37 weeks. She had no complications during pregnancy or birth. She is meeting all milestones. She passed her newborn hearing screen. ROS negative.
Rhabdomyosarcoma’s are malignant tumors of mesenchymal origin that are from precursor skeletal muscle cells. These tumors can arise in many different locations and clinically present as different tissue types, including fat, muscle and soft tissue. Unfortunately, the prognosis of these tumors is extremely poor, especially with metastasis. Fortunately these tumors are relatively rare and the prognosis has been steadily improving for non-metastatic disease. There are 3 different histological subtypes of this tumor; alveolar, embryonal, and pleomorphic/anaplastic. 

Rhabdomyosarcoma’s are the most common type of soft tissue tumors in the pediatric population, but are still rare tumors in general. They have a 3 to 4 percent prevalence rate for pediatric patients overall, with two-thirds of cases diagnosed under the age of six [1]. There is a race predilection with higher incidence in Blacks than Whites and lower incidence in Asians than Whites. There also seems to be male predominance with a male to female ratio that is 1.3-1.5. These tumors can be seen in many locations throughout the body, however the most common locations are the head and neck region (36%), genitourinary tract (23%), extremities (19%) and others (22%) [2].

Of the 3 different histological subtypes, the embryonal is the most common (70-80%), followed by alveolar (15-20%), and pleomorphic/anaplastic subtypes are extremely rare [3]. In addition to the histological features of the tumor, the genetic and molecular features are analyzed for further management and prognostic value. Each histological subtype has its own molecular component. For the embryonal subtype, the cells can by analyzed for a MyoD1 mutation (a poorer outcome). The alveolar subtype can have a translocation between the FOXO1 and PAX3 or PAX7 genes. Studies have shown that a positive FOXO1 translocation could have a worse prognosis [4]. In addition to molecular analysis, prognosis is determined by the typical factors of most neoplasms, stage and grade. However, with rhabdomyosarcoma’s there are some additional prognostic factors that are looked at. Histologic subtype is a factor that is used for prognosis. Pleomorphic subtypes have the best prognosis of the 3 major subtypes (75% 5-year survival rate) followed by embryonal (66% 5-year survival rate) and then alveolar (54% 5-year survival rate).  

A high degree of suspension is required to make the diagnosis for a rhabdomyosarcoma. Majority cases sporadic, but there are some associations with genetic syndromes, such as, Li-Fraumeni, Beckwith-Wiedemann, and Costello syndromes [3]. Signs of rhabdomyosarcoma can include, lump or swelling that doesn’t go away or grows rapidly, bulging of the eye, headache, and epistaxis. Since the presentation can be non-specific, further investigation includes, doppler ultrasound for assessment of flow, biopsy of the mass, and MRI is preferable in head and neck tumors, paraspinal tumors, limb and genitourinary primaries and CT is recommended for tumors in the chest and abdomen. After appropriate work up and diagnosis, proper management can be initiated.
