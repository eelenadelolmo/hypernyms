Work up for presyncopal episodes included brain MRI and echocardiogram which were negative, and carotid Doppler ultrasound which revealed 70-80% stenosis of right carotid artery. Abnormal flow was also seen in the right vertebral artery.  A catheter angiogram was performed.
â€¢ Right subclavian artery does not fill from aorta
â€¢ Proximal left subclavian irregular
â€¢ Delayed filling of right subclavian from the vertebral artery
