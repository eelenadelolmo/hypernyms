Texto: 
Examination: Verrucous, hyperkeratotic, well circumscribed plaque on bilateral labia minora.
Treatment/Course: Reassurance. Excision was offered, but deferred.
Histopathology: The biopsy shows neutrophils within the stratum corneum, parakeratosis, and marked epidermal hyperplasia without significant atypia. The papillary dermis contains foamy cells with acute and chronic inflammation. PAS stains were negative for fungi.
Case 16 (27th Annual Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, 2003) VERRUCIFORM XANTHOMA
History: 33-year-old female with Turner's Syndrome, HTN, hypothyroidism and hypercholesterolemia presents with a one year history of asymptomatic lesion of the vulva. The lesion had an insidious onset and was not associated with bleeding, ulceration, or crusting. There was no history of local trauma or venereal disease. The lesion did not respond to three months of twice daily application of a high potency steroid. She had a history of HPV and abnormal pap smears. Treatment with Aldara did not alter the lesion.
