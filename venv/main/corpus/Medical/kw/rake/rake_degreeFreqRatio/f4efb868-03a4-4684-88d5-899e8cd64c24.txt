Physical examination of the patient reveals a large tattoo which extends across the patient's back.
Routine mammograms recommended yearly.
Craniocaudal  and  mediolateral  oblique  views  of  both  breasts  were obtained  utilizing  digital  acquisition.  There  are  scattered fibroglandular  densities.    No  suspicious  finding  is  identified  within the  right  breast.  
  
On  the  left  mediolateral  oblique  view  posteriorly,  there  is  a  dense ovoid  mass.  Further  evaluation  with  left  spot  compression mediolateral  oblique  and left  lateral  views was recommended.

Patient returned for a diagnostic left breast mammogram and sonogram. Additional  views  of  the  left  breast  demonstrate  abnormally  dense  lymph  nodes  in  the  low likely  lateral  left  breast.  These  lymph  nodes are located  approximately  20  cm  deep  to  the  nipple.  The  lymph nodes  have  an  appearance  consistent  with  that  of  tattoo  pigment.    The  patient  demonstrates  extensive  body tattoos.  An  attempt  to  locate  these  densities  by  sonography was  performed, but the lymph nodes were not definitely located due to far posterior location.

Axillary and mammary lymph nodes are common radiographic findings identified on the mediolateral oblique views of both screening and diagnostic mammograms.  In fact, these lymph nodes are so frequently encountered that they are rarely commented upon in mammographic reports.  

Normal axillary and mammary lymph nodes are classically small and oval-shaped with rounded, lucent centers due to the presence of hilar fat.  Conversely, abnormal lymph nodes are characterized by increased density and/or size, absence of hilar fat, loss of the normal oval or reniform shape and poorly circumscribed margins with or without the presence of intranodal calcification.  Size less than 1.5 cm is a commonly reported but highly nonspecific criterion for benignity.  Abnormal axillary and mammary lymph nodes are most commonly secondary to nonspecific reactive hyperplasia or primary breast carcinoma, but may also be seen in systemic processes such as lymphoma, metastatic melanoma and ovarian cancer, as well as infectious processes such as tuberculosis, cat-scratch disease and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
	
Lymph nodes containing high-density foci or dense calcifications are typically benign, though microcalcifications or pleomorphic calcifications in axillary lymph nodes may suggest a more ominous diagnosis of metastatic breast or ovarian cancer.  High density melanin in axillary or mammary lymph nodes may portend a diagnosis of malignant melanoma, and is often radiographically indistinguishable from intranodal calcium.  In addition, patients who have previously undergone long-term gold salt therapy for rheumatoid arthritis may present with punctate or amorphous high-density deposits within normal-sized axillary or mammary lymph nodes.  Likewise, patients with large upper-extremity, chest or back tattoos secondary to deposition of dye pigment within axillary or mammary lymph nodes often present with a similar mammographic appearance.  In these situations, obtaining a thorough patient history and conducting a comprehensive physical examination are of the utmost importance for developing a differential diagnosis and ultimately arriving at the correct diagnosis.
	
Once a tattoo is placed, some of the pigment is phagocytosed by macrophages, and may initially be found in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes and phagocytic cells including fibroblasts, macrophages and mast cells.  These phagocytic cells slowly migrate to regional lymph nodes via the lymphatic system and if tattoo pigment is present in adequate quantities, it may easily mimic intranodal calcification on mammography.  The composition of the tattoo pigment is an additional factor which partially determines whether the pigment will be dense enough to mimic calcification radiographically.  Interestingly, the tattoo pigment within axillary or mammary lymph nodes persists even if the tattoo is subsequently removed.
	
Definitive diagnosis is made pathologically.  Lymph nodes may be surgically excised, biopsied via sonographic assistance, or aspirated using a fine needle.  Although the differential diagnosis may often be narrowed given the appearance of dense intranodal pigment and a thorough patient history, tissue sampling is the only definitive way to exclude an ongoing infectious or neoplastic process.
