Cachectic in appearance with an otherwise unremarkable physical examination. Laboratory results to date revealed mild anemia and electrolyte abnormalities.
Treatment typically consists of anti-inflammatory medications and surgery if required for adequate control of symptoms.
Both images demonstrate an unusually smooth appearance of the terminal ileum along with separation of the terminal ileum from the remainder of the small bowel loops.
Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum
Differential diagnosis for these imaging findings includes infective causes, malignancy, and inflammatory bowel disease (Chrohn's Disease or ulcerative colitis).
26 y/o female with 25 pound weight loss in the last nine months.
The findings for this patient were isolated to the terminal ileum, although Crohn's Disease can present anywhere along the GI tract from the mouth to the anus.
