PE is remarkable only for focal back pain, there was no cervical or supraclavicular adenopathy. VSS and Afebrile.CA-125 of 48 (elevated), CEA of 0.7 (wnl), CA 19.9 < 1(wnl), LDH 740
CHOP-R six cycles
RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:  CT with contrast revealed a 12 x18 heterogeneous multiloculated pelvic mass with adjacent collections of low density free fluid, a soft tissue density mass measuring 4x7.4 cm at superior pole of right kidney and a 7.6 x 7.2 cm fluid-filled collection anterior to ascending colon. An aortocaval lymphnode measuring 12x13 mm and additional subcentimeter nodes were identified.
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(1) Ovarian Carcinoma 
(2) Acute leukemia  
(3) Non Hodgkin’s Lymphoma  
(4)  Renal cell carcinoma
The patient is a 50-year-old post menopausal white female who came to medical attention for progressive back pain of two months duration with worsening after a fall two weeks ago.  MRI of spine showed L3 compression fracture and incidental finding of a large pelvic mass. 

The patient was referred to OBGYN consult as this was worrisome for a gynecologic malignancy. She reports night sweats but no fever, chills or weight loss. The patient also reports some low extremity weakness.  

PMH: Diabetes, hypothyroidism, Obesity, Barrett’s esophagus, Obesity. 

FH: none
A newly identified pelvic mass and associated elevated CA-125 placed Ovarian Carcinoma high in the differential diagnosis for this patient, especially considering that she is post menopausal.  The diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma was somewhat of a surprise.

The presence of a pathologic fracture of L3 vertebra may necessitate the need for adjunctive radiation therapy.
