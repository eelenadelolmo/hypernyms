Ankylosing spondylitis with fracture through the T10-11 disc
Traumatic vs non-traumatic Fx
76 year old man with known COPD was admitted to an outside hospital after a syncopal episode. Melana as noted, and he had an endoscopy - showing a gastic ulcer.  At that point patient he had acute SOB and then a CT  to rule out Pulmonary Embolus.
This case has a very interesting sequence of events that began with syncope (fainting).  GI bleeding was identified (melena) - prompting an endoscopy, that found a gastric (stomach) ulcer as the probable cause of GI bleeding.  During the endoscopic procedure, acute shortness of breach raised the specter of pulmonary embolism (PE), for which contrast CT was obtained.  That CT identified previously unknown spine fractures, and a background of bridging osteophytes and "bamboo" spine - from ankylosing spondylitis.
