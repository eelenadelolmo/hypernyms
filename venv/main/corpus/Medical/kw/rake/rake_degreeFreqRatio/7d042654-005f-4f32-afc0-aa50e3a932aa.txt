Physical examination revealed knee effusion with significant tenderness in the medial retinaculum and in the medial aspect of patella.
&#932;he patient is scheduled for arthroscopy to remove the intra-articular loose body and for surgical repair of the medial retinaculum tear.
Proton density weighted images with and without fat saturation in axial, coronal and sagittal plane demonstrate  the typical injury pattern of transient patellar dislocation associated with an osteochondral loose body.
Transient Patellar Dislocation
• Medial Collateral ligament tear
• Patellar injury and dislocation
• Patellofemoral joint syndromes
• Meniscal injuries
21 year old male presents with acute knee pain after a direct blow in patella during sports activity
Acquisition of fat saturated MR images,, either proton density weighted or intermediate- weighted ,  in all three planes in essential to demonstrate the oedema and the degree of injury of patella and retinaculum ligaments.
