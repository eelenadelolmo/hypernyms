Texto: 
Red, Plethoric face with edema.
Clinically managed
Right sided mediport with extensive collateral cutaneous blood flow.  Collaterals include internal mammary vessels, cutaneous extension with flow to the inferior epigastric vessels, recanalization of the paraumbilical vein.  "Hot Quadrate" seen within the liver secondary to recanalized paraumbilical vein and retrograde flow toward hepatic veins.
SVC Syndrome
Most frequently SVC obstruction and the SVC syndrome is caused by malignancy, specifically metastatic disease.  In this case, long term indwelling catheter caused stenosis of the SVC.  There was no metastatic breast carcinoma despite the patient's history.
64 yo female with hx of breat cancer, chemotherapy, presents with facial and neck swelling, headache, mild nausea.
