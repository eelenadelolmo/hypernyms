Texto: 
Decreased breath sounds right upper lung field.  Normotensive blood pressure.
Chest tube evacuation (closed tube drainage).  May require thoracoscopic bullectomy if a persistent air leak occurs or if recurrent episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax occur.
Thin visceral pleural line outlined by air on both sides.  Abscence of pulmonary vascular markings  lateral (peripheral) to the visceral pleural line.  No mediastinal or tracheal shift.
Pneumothorax (primary spontaneous - idiopathic)
Skin fold (folding of overlying soft tissues)
Progressive shortness of breath and sharp right-sided chest pain for several hours.  No history of trauma or significant past medical history.
Past medical history is negative. No known pulmonary apical blebs or bullae.  No family history of spontaneous pneumothorax.
