Texto: 
temp 102
wbc 36,000 with 85% neutrophils and bandemia
lungs: CTAB
heart: regular; rate 100
abdomen: soft, NT, ND, normal BS
right leg: warm, tense, mottled skin, tender to palpate
Editors Note: the author of this teaching file did not report on treatment and follow up.  However, treatment involves extensive fasciotomy, debridement, multi-antibiotic therapy, and hyperbaric oxygen treatments.
Severe edema of the deep fascia of the proximal quadriceps muscle group is seen on CT extending posteriorly to its insertion on the linea aspera.
Fat sat T2 axial imaging shows extensive edema in the deep facia of several muscles, the soft tissues, and the vastus intermedius/lateralis, and the tensor fascia lata.
Somewhat paradoxically, the fat sat gadolinium enhanced axial T1 images do not demonstrate enhancement of the fascia, perhaps do to its normal ligamentous character.
