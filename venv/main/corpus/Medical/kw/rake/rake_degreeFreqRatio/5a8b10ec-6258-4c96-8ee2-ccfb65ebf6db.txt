Multiple linear and curvilinear lucencies are noted on the scout images throughout the liver, as well as multiple dilated air filled loops of small and large bowel. On the axial CT images, air was noted within the bowel wall completely surrounding the lumen throughout multiple loops of small bowel, as well as air within the mesenteric vasculature, and within the portal venous system peripherally to the edges of the liver.
