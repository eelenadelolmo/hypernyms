Patient was pale in appearance, but otherwise healthy appearing.  Laboratory work was significant for a hemoglobin of 10.7 and a hematocrit of 32.2.  The remainder of the patientâ€™s laboratory values were within normal limits.
Patient is being treated with chemotherapy and will have reimaging after his third cycle to assess tumor response.  Patient is also scheduled to have PET imaging to evaluate for metastases.
Portable chest radiograph demonstrates near complete white-out of the left lung with mass effect demonstrated by mediastinal shift to the right.  Multiple axial CT images demonstrate a large heterogeneously enhancing mass, which appears to arise from the anterior mediastinum and extends into the left hemithorax.  The mass displace the heart to the right, and also encompasses a portion of the aortic arch and great vessels superiorly.  The mass measures approximately 14 x 15 x 9 cm.  There is a large left pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis of the remaining lung field.  A small pleural effusion is present on the right.  A large pericardial effusion is present.   The mass does not appear to invade the chest wall as there is preservation of the chest wall musculature and ribs.
Hodgkin's Lymphoma
Teratoma
Lymphoma
Thymoma
Germ cell tumor
Ectopic Thyroid
18 year-old active duty marine with two-month history of progressive dyspnea, cough, chest pain, and decreased exercise tolerance.  Patient states that he was no longer able to work out as he had previously, and this is what eventually sent him to sick call.  The patient denies any history of fever, night sweats, pruritis, or weight loss.
Both Hodgkin's and nonHodgkin's lymphoma can present as large anterior mediastinal masses.  Hodgkin's lymphoma is differentiated from nonHodgkin's lymphoma by the presence of the Reed-Sternberg cell.  Hodgkin's lymphoma most commonly presents in the second or third decade with a second peak in the fifth or sixth decade.  In this case the patient presented at the age of 18.  Systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, weight loss and fatigue can also be seen in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma.  This patient denied any history of fever or night sweats, but did complain of decreasing exercise tolerance over the course of two-months.  Hodgkin's lymphoma also has a predictable mode of spread from one lymph node group to contiguous groups.
