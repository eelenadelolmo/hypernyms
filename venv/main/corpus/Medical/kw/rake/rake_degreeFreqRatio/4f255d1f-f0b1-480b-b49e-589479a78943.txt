Left basilar rales and ronchi with mild inspiratory and expiratory wheeze.
Treated with appropriate anti-biotic therapy for 7 to 14 days.  If symptoms and abnormality persist after appropriate therapy, then further evaluation with chest CT is warranted.
PA radiograph demonstrates subtle airway wall thickening, specifically in the left base.  

Lateral radiograph demonstrates a wedge shaped opacity overlying the posterior edge of the cardiac border, just behind the crest of the left hemidiaphragm.
LLL anterior basilar segmental pneumonia
Acute bronchitis with atelectasis
Left Lower Lobe Anterior Basilar segmental pneumonia
Obstructive atelectasis by a malignancy or
granulomatous mass/infection
Sequestration-Bronchopulmonary/Intralobar
25 yo male with 4 month history of chronic cough.  Complains of recent worsening of symptoms to include fever, chills, and productive cough.
Given the history of the patient in a known healthy young male, LLL segmental pneumonia is the most likely diagnosis.  The patient does have airway wall thickening suggestive of bronchitis; however one would expect more wall thickening to cause complete obstruction of the LLL anterior basilar segment.  Without a history of a granulomatous disease or malignancy, these diagnosis are unlikely.  Sequestration is unlikely since the patient does not have a history of recurrent infections and there is not chronic scarring or air fluid levels.  Also, intralobar sequestrations tend to locate in the posterior basilar segment.  The appropriate history would raise the concern for a fungal etiology.  If the patient does not improve or relapses, then further evaluation with chest CT and possibly bronchoscopy would be indicated.
