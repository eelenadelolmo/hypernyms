Texto: 
Patients vitals are stable.  The abdomen is soft and diffusely tender to palpation.  Bedside FAST exam is positive for free intraperitoneal fluid.  Pelvis is unstable on exam.  No evidence of blood at the urethral meatus.  No evidence of perineal, scrotal, or pelvic hematoma.  No evidence of high-ridding, boggy, or absent prostate on rectal exam.
Exploratory laparotomy to rule out other abdominal injuries.
Primary surgical repair of the bladder perforation.
Primary surgical repair of the pelvic fracture.
Intense outpatient rehabilitation with physical therapy.
AP view of pelvis:
  >Fractures of the superior and inferior pubic rami bilaterally
  >Femoral heads appear seated within the acetabula
  >No gross diastasis of the SI joints or the pubic symphysis

Retrograde Cystourethrogram
  >Free spillage of contrast material into the peritoneal cavity compatible with intraperitoneal bladder perforation.  Note there is contrast surrounding loops of bowel, it is not confined to the retroperitoneum.
Traumatic Intraperitoneal Bladder Perforation
Intraperitoneal Bladder Perforation
Extraperitoneal Bladder Perforation
Radiographic Artifact Secondary to Contrast Spilling
Unrestrained driver of head-on car versus tree motor vehicle collision.  Patient admits to being ejected from the vehicle at the time of impact.
