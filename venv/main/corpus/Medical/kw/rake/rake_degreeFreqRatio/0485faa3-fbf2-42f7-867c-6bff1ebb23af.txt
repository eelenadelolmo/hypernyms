Chiari II Malformation
Chiari II malformation
Chronic shunting
15 year old boy with known history of Chiari II malformation.
A non-contrast head CT was the only neuroimaging study available at this institution.  Further imaging would likely have revealed the presence of a meningocele or myelomeningocele which are also present in this condition.
