Muffled heart sounds and no breath sounds on the right side of the chest.

Null mutation in p53 gene.
Palliative care.
Chest X-Ray (PA and LAT) shows right side volume loss with complete opacification of right lung.  There is cardiomegally and calcified nodular opacities at the right cardiophrenic border. 

Axial CT of the chest shows soft tissue mass surounding heart and complete drowning of the right lung.
Ovarian Cancer metastasis
Calcium producing Metastatic Tumor vs. New Malignancy
- Bone Tumors: osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma
- Mucinous Tumors:  colon cancer, thyroid cancer,
     pancreatic cancer, stomach cancer, ovarian cancer
Infection
53 year old white woman reports with clincal history of ovarian cancer and shortness of breath.
Ovarian cancers in women with a null mutation in the p53 gene have been associated with distant mets more than 8 times more frequently.  More than 85 percent of the time, ovarian cancer remains in the peritoneum throughout its course. Metastasis to the pericardium, as in this case, is extremely rare and has been reported infrequently.
