Polyps of endometrium are seen in about 10% of all uterus. Large polyps result In distension of the endometrial cavity. Cystic areas or contrast enhancement of  the stalk favor the diagnosis of polyp.  Polyps show pronounced early enhancement, and this helps distinguish them from endometrial cancer which typically shows mild enhancement.
