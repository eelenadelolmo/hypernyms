Rheumatologic serology panel negative.
Proliferate and erosive findings at the DIP and PIP joints consisting of central erosions and marginal osteophytes, giving a "gull-wing" appearance at those locations.  Also note relatively unaffected proximal structures, with the exception of typical degenerative changes (although relatively mild) at the STT joint and 1st MCP.
Erosive (inflammatory) Osteoarthritis (typical radiologic appearance, absence of skin or other bony involvement, negative laboratory evaluation).
Erosive Osteoarthritis
