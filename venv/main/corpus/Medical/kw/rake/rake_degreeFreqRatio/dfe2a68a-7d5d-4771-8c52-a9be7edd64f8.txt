Texto: 
Shortness of breath without any other major symptoms. D dimer was positive while all other lab values were within normal limits.
There are bilateral filling defects in the lower lobe pulmonary segmental arteries with a thin rim of contrast surrounding the thrombus consistent with acute embolism. There is no abnormality in the artery wall contour. There is also no enlargement of the right ventricle to indicate hypertrophy from strain.
Acute Pulmonary Embolism
Acute vs Chronic Pulmonary Embolism. Given the vague circumferential contrast apparent in some areas of the filling defects, lack of wall irregularities of the pulmonary arterial branches, and presentation with acute symptoms, this is most consistent with acute pulmonary embolism.
71 y/o female with known breast CA who now has low DiCO and mild SOB.
