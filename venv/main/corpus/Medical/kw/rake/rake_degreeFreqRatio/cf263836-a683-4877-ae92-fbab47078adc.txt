Ataxia.  No focal neurological deficit.
Surgical excision. Chemotherapy pending
• Enhancing intraventricular mass occupying the 4th ventricle.
• Hydrocephalus
• Tiny nodules of abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement adjacent to cervical spinal cord and in the interpeduncular cistern.
Medulloblastoma with leptomeningeal spread
• Medulloblastoma (PNET)
• Ependymoma
• Astrocytoma
• Choroid Plexus Papilloma
2 year old boy with a 1 month history of ataxia and nausea and vomiting.
The most common posterior fossa masses are astrocytoma and medulloblastoma (PNET - primitive neuroectodermal tumor).  Astrocytomas are most often fluid secreting pilocytic astrocytoma, WHO Gr1, and lateral in the cerebellar hemisphere.  Midline masses involving the fourth ventricle are usually medullblastoma, that arise in the vermis and secondarily invade.  Measured by incidence, ependymoma is in third place.
