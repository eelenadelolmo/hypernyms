Acute pyelonephritis is caused by bacterial infection that has ascended from the lower urinary tract or,  by hematogenous spread.  Antibiotics typically make this disease easily managed; however, complications may occur.

Pyelonephritis becomes a potentially fatal disease when secondary conditions develop, such as emphysematous pyelonephritis (20-80% mortality rate), perinephric abscess (20-50% mortality rate), or one of the sepsis syndromes (>25% overall mortality rate). 

CT is generally used in the evaluation of pyelonephritis to asses for complications.  Long term complications include renal scarring and potentially decreased renal function if repetitive infections occur.  The most common pathogen is E. coli (70-80%).  Others include Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
