Texto: 
The patient has continued abdominal pain and TTP.  Her WBC count has remained elevated at 19K.
Culdocentesis with insertion of a 'pig tail' catheter for continued drainage resulted in complete resolution of patient's symptoms.  Follow up ultrasound a month later showed no evidence of complex cystic mass.
Complex cystic mass in the Rectouterine pouch (cul-de-sac of Douglas)
In this particular post-operative setting abscess and hematoma are most likely (unless there was abgiguity regarding the initial appendicitis diagnosis).
