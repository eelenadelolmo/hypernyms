Physical exam and vitals normal.  No respiratory complaints.
The patient denied pulmonary symptoms.  The patient did complain of persistent headaches in the days following the embolization procedure.
Chest radiograph demonstrates branching opacity in a bronchovascular distribution in the right middle lobe.
Review of prior imaging demonstrates presence of a Vein of Galen malformation with recent embolization treatment with Onyx.
Vein of Galen Malformation, Onyx embolization; and,  embolization into branches of the Pulmonary arteries.
Without the provided history, this radiographic finding is concerning for aspiration of contrast or other radio-opaque material.
8 year old girl status post Vein of Galen Aneurysm Onyx embolization treatment.  A Chest X-ray was ordered to confirm endotracheal tube placement following an uneventful post-operative course.
This radiographic finding was noted immediately following embolization of the patient's Vein of Galen (VOG) malformation using the liquid embolic agent, Onyx.  Onyx is a relatively new material composed of an ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, DMSO, and tantalum.  Tantalum provides the radio-opaque property for intraoperative visualization and accounts for the appearance on this patients chest radiograph.  

Relatively little formal analysis of the efficacy and safety of the use of Onyx in the treatment intracerebral AVM's has been conducted.  A study by Van Rooij et al, revealed an average of 75% reduction in the volume of AVM's with a complication rate of 13.6%.  Jahan et al reported similar numbers of 63% and 26%, respectively.  While post-embolization headaches were reported, the majority of collected and reported problems involved hemorrhagic complications.  Such complications are postulated to be secondary to physiologic changes in the regional cerebral blood flow surrounding the perinidal tissues.  Proposed solutions to such complications include possible staged emobolization procedures such to produce less-drastic changes in flow dynamics.

While no instances of symptomatic pulmonary embolism(PE) were reported in these investigations, symptomatic pulmonary embolism is a serious potential consequence of accidental peripheral emobolization.  As in this patient’s case, the risk of symptomatic PE is likely lower if only small volumes of the embolic agent migrate to the pulmonary vasculature.  This is a risk that may be mitigated with careful technique and intraoperative observation.
