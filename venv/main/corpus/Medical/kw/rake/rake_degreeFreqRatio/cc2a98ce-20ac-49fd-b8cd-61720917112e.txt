The patient went emergently to the operating room.  The left testicle was pale in appearance, and bilateral bell-clapper deformities were identified.  Orchipexy was performed and blood flow to the left testicle was restored, confirmed by intraoperative sonography (images unavailable).
Realtime gray-scale, color-flow, and pulsed Doppler sonographic evaluation of the testes was performed using a 12 MHz high-frequency linear transducer.  Images reveal absent perfusion to the left testicle on both color and power Doppler techniques.  The left testicle is mildly enlarged measuring 4.5 cm craniocaudad x 2.8 cm AP x 3.0 cm transverse, and there is a large left-sided hydrocele.  The right testicle measured 3.5 cm craniocaudad x 2.2 cm AP x 2.8 cm transverse (images not shown).  The echotexture of the testes is normal, as are the right testis vascular waveforms.  The twisted left spermatic cord is seen as a tubular homogeneous extratesticular mass with minimal blood flow.  There is scrotal wall thickening.
