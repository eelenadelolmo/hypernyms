Surgical removal
â€¢ Hyperintense "cystic" mass in roof of third ventricle
â€¢ Adjacent to left foramen of Monro
â€¢ Mass does not enhance.
â€¢ No hydrocephalus.
Colloid Cyst
â€¢ Colloid cyst
â€¢ Parasitic infection (Cysticercosis)
â€¢ Ependymal cyst
â€¢ Choroid Plexus Cyst
â€¢ Metastatic disease

â€¢ aneurysm
27 year old woman with progressively worsening headaches.
This colloid cyst is somewhat atypical, in that it is not in the midline and appears to extend toward the left frontal horn.  Most colloid cysts present clearly within the third ventricle, attached to the roof, just behind the foramen of Monro.
