Vital signs within normal limits.  Mild epigastric tenderness to palpation as well as vague periumbilical pain.  Benign-sounding systolic murmur.  Poor dentition. Physical exam otherwise unremarkable.
Surgery and GI were consulted in the ER, and the patient was taken for endoscopy due to suspected ingestion of rare earth magnets.  Three magnets were visualized at the gastro-esophageal junction, with 2 of these magnets visible from the esophageal side and one visible in the stomach on endoscopic retroflex view of the stomach cardia.  One magnet could be removed with endoscopy but the magnets on either side of the gastroesophageal junction were left in place for fear that removal would cause more local trauma.  Family was counseled on the possibility of erosion and fistula, and the patient was admitted for observation and discharged after 2 days with no change in position of the residual two magnets.  On outpatient follow-up, he continued to have intermittent abdominal pain but without vomiting or fever.  Repeat radiograph a week later continued to show unchanged location of magnets.  Serial follow-up with subspecialists revealed subsequent migration of magnets without perforation or fistula as sequelae, though he did have some ulceration and residual indentations.
Initial radiograph with 3 radioopaque spherical foreign bodies located in mid upper abdomen, suspected to be near the stomach.  Follow-up X-ray shows 2 radioopaque spherical foreign bodies in similar location as first.  No pneumoperitoneum in either image. Moderate stool burden but no obstructive pattern.
Foreign body ingestion of rare earth magnets
Magnets, BB pellets, beads, candy with radioopaque coating, some pills
12 yo boy with acute onset epigastric abdominal pain presents to school nurse after science class.  Teacher reports they were working with magnets in class that day, but patient denies having placed any in his mouth or ingesting any.  Mother brings patient in to the ER.  No fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. No new food exposures.
The ingestion of magnets in pediatric patients has become more common as they are increasingly featured in toys, science kits, and faux body piercings.  Magnets are also occasionally mistaken for candy by younger children.  As stronger magnets are used in these toys, there have been more reports of volvulus, bowel perforation, obstruction, and fistula formation.  In the late 2000s, there were increasing reports of complications secondary to ingestion of rare earth magnets, which are very powerful yet small (3-6mm) in size.  Incidence increased 8.5-fold between 2003 and 2011.  By 2008, there were over 200 reports, many of which required emergency surgical intervention.  A single ingested magnet generally passes through the GI tract without interference, but very powerful magnets can even attract metallic components of clothing (eg belt buckles or metallic buttons).  When multiple powerful magnets are ingested, they can attract one another despite being geographically separated in the GI tract, resulting in ischemia or necrosis of the compressed areas.  In 2012, algorithms for the management of ingested magnets in children were published in JPGN.  Recommendations include initial X-ray (2-view to determine whether there is truly only a single magnet or multiple).  The number of magnets involved, the time between ingestion and presentation, and the location of the magnets help guide subsequent management and involvement of GI and/or Surgery.  Children with delayed presentation, defined as greater than 12 hours from time of ingestion, demonstrated more complications.
