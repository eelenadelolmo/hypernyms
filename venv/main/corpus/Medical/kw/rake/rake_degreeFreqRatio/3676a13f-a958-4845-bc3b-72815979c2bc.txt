• Increased densities in the anterior and posterior mediastinum
• Enlarged prevascular lymph node, 1.7cm
• Enlarged Peritracheal lymph node, 1.6cm
• Moderate pericardial effusion
Classical Hodgkin's Lymphoma, nodular sclerosing type
• Thymic tumors
• Pericardial tumors
• Mediastinal carcinoids
• Cystic mediastinal lesions
• Thoracic fungal infections
• Other causes of lymphadenopathy
21 year old man with a 2 month history of abdominal pain, weight loss, fevers, and chills.
•Lymphomas are divided into Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s.
•Hodgkin’s lymphoma is characterized by Reed-Sternberg cells, with 4 subtypes.
•In the thorax, nodular sclerosing is the most common subtype with a predilection for the mediastinum.
•Nodular sclerosing accounts for >50% of Hodgkin’s lymphomas.
•Frequency - In the US, 7400 estimated new cases in 2001
•Bimodal distribution - 15-40 years old, >55 years old
•Treatment consists of radiation and/or chemotherapy
•Survival rates, 1yr-93%, 5yr-82%, 10yr-72%, 15yr-63%
