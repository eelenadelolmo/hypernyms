Pneumomediastinum due to barotrauma
• Booerhave’s syndrome
• Asthma or other conditions leading to alveolar rupture
• Bowel rupture
• Malignancy
• Trauma
21 y.o. man presented to the Emergency Department with complaints of nausea and vomiting with blood tinged sputum x2 days.  Per patient, N/V started after eating Mexican food, associated with diarrhea; and, after multiple episodes of retching, he noticed some blood tinged emesis.  

He also complains of difficulty swallowing, talking, and neck fullness.  Denies chest pain or SOB, prior sore throat or URI symptoms, and afebrile at home.
Given this particular patient's history, the likely cause of his pneumomediastinum is due to barotrauma from retching/vomiting associated with viral gastroenteritis.
