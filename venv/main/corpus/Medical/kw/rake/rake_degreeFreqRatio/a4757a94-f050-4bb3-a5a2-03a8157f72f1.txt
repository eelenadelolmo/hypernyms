Generalized decreased breath sounds
N/A
The images suggest an progressive interstital lung disease characterized by nodules that evolve to become cystic and clustered.  The air-filled cysts have thin walls and the disease is progressing to end stage fibrosis.
Pulmonary Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis
Pulmonary Langerhans Cell Histiocystosis
Lymphangiomyomatosis
Campbell Williams Syndrome
46 y.o. woman with a history of hypothyroidism, diabetes insipidus, and biliary obstruction.  She presents now with increasing shortness of breath and cough.  She is a smoker.
Langerhans cells, which were originally discovered in squamous epithelium, are part of the widespread system of dendritic cells.  These cells, which arise from CD34+ progenitors, are specialized and efficient antigen-presenting cells for T-cell-mediated immunity. In this disease, however, the major associated cells are not T cells, but mature eosinophils: hence the original name eosinophilic granuloma.

Langerhans cell histiocystosis occurs most commonly in young children (under 6 years) and usually is characterized by agressive lytic bone lesions.  In the disseminated form, the classic triad is of lytic bone lesions, diabetes insipidus, and exophthalmos.  The liver and spleen are often enlarged due to involvement.  The outdated term histiocytosis X was meant to cover a spectrum of three diseases--eosinophilic granuloma, Hand-Schuller-Christian disease (HSC), and Letterer-Siwe disease (LS).

Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis commonly occurs in young adults and is a terrible progressive disease with the deterioration of lung function despite corticosteroid and D-penicillamine treatment.  Most patients are cigarette smokers (90%) and complain of cough (50%), which may be accompanied by exertional dyspnea (35%). The onset of dyspnea is acute in those patients with pneumothorax (10-20%).
