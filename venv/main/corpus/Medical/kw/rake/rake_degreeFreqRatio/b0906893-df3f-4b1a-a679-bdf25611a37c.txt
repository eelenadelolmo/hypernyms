Chest Radiograph (PA): Adequate technique and inflation.  The heart, great vessels, and pulmonary vasculature are unremarkable.  There is minimal scaring at the bases of both lungs.  There is evidence of old granulomatous disease.  A thin linear opacity is seen in the periphery of the mid left lung, running in a superolateral direction.
Left minor fissure
Normal anatomic variant (accessory fissure)
Linear atelectasis
Pleural scar
Wall of a bulla
The patient is a 72-year-old male with COPD, prior TIAs, ESRD, and uncontrolled hypertension who is undergoing a pre-operative chest radiograph for a high risk vascular surgery procedure.
