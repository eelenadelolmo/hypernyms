• Palpable left testicular mass
• Serum Alpha-fetoprotein 31.3 ng/ml (normal range 0.5-7.9)
A left radical orchiectomy was performed.  CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with oral & IV contrast were performed after the surgery and showed no evidence of metastatic disease.

Repeat CT scans at 3 month intervals for one year showed no evidence of metastatic disease.  Serial measurements of AFP were obtained monthly for 6 months following surgery, and all were within normal limits.  No chemotherapy has been given to date.
Ultrasound: Both testes are indentified within the scrotum.  The right testis is normal in size measuring approximately 0.4 cc in volume.  The left testis is enlarged measuring 1.8 cc in volume.  There is a mass seen within the left testis that measures approximately 1.1 cc in volume.  The mass has mixed echogenicity but is a solid mass with no cystic components.  There is flow in both testes.  Most of the flow on the left side surrounds the mass.
Yolk sac tumor
• Testicular neoplasm
• Testicular torsion
• Hydrocele
• Inguinal hernia
• Orchitis
The patient is a 16 month old boy who presented with a swollen left testis.
At surgery a frozen section confirmed the diagnosis of yolk sac tumor, and a left radical orchiectomy was performed.  Following surgery, imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis did not reveal evidence of metastatic disease; this patient, therefore, was diagnosed with a Stage I yolk sac tumor.  The serum level of AFP decreased to within normal limits immediately following surgery.  Serial measurement of AFP levels for 6 months following surgery did not reveal any elevations of AFP.   No chemotherapy has been employed, as it is not currently recommended for a Stage I yolk sac tumor.
