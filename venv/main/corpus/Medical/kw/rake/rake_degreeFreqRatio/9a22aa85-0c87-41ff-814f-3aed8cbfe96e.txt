Interventional radiology was consulted. The believed diagnosis based on the CT findings was conveyed to the patient and a decision was made to proceed with a left renal angiogram to confirm the diagnosis and to attempt to embolization of the arteriovenous fistula. The left renal angiogram confirmed the diagnosis as mentioned previously.  Attempt at embolization of the distal branch of the left renal artery with detachable coils failed multiple attempts due to high flow across the fistula. The decision was made to stop the procedure. Shortly after the procedure the team in coordination with the patient and her family decided not to pursue another attempt as she remained asymptomatic.
CT Abdomen with and without contrast using angiogram and venogram protocol:
Arterial phase of the study demonstrates a posterior branch of the left renal artery ending as a large (5 cm x 4 cm) aneurysm like dilatation at the renal hilum which in turn empties more anteriorly through a narrowing (about 0.2 cm) into a renal vein tributary.

56 y.o. woman presented to an outside urology service after she was found to have microscopic hematuria on a routine evaluation. She denies any history of flank pain,  renal surgery, or trauma. Patient does not smoke. Patient was evaluated via cytoscopy which was negative. Cytology was sent for malignant cells which was negative as well. CT abdomen was done which demonstrated a left renal abnormality. Further imaging was then obtained. 

PMHx: HTN, sleep apnea

Medication: Lisinopril 10 mg daily
A renal arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is a relatively rare diagnosis especially in a patient such as ours who has not undergone any previous renal procedures or trauma. Taking this history into account the patientâ€™s etiology is mostly likely idiopathic which is the case in less than 5% of all renal AVFs. Patients with renal AVFs often present with microscopic hematuriaâ€”as our patient didâ€”but may also present with gross hematuria, symptoms of congestive heart failure, and hypertension. The gold standard for diagnosis of AVF is angiography which is invasive yet warranted in a patient who is clearly symptomatic and will need intervention.  However, a noninvasive imaging modality such as dynamic CT could be an alternative diagnostic tool for patients in whom invasive intervention is not necessary or contraindicated. Dynamic CT, in particular, is beneficial in this case because we can visualize injected contrast during two distinct phases of blood flow: arterial phase and venous phase.  In our case the patientâ€™s dynamic CT demonstrated early opacification of the left renal vein in images taken during the arterial phase suggesting that there was a direct connection between the renal arterial and venous system allowing contrast to enter the venous system before it should have. Our patient did have an angiogram done to confirm the diagnosis during interventional radiologyâ€™s attempt to embolize the vascular defect. However, if the decision had been made for conservative expectant management, the team would have felt confident in the diagnosis obtained via dynamic CT rather than subjecting the patient to the invasive gold standard angiogram.
