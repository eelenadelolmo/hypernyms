N/A
Patient was subsequently treated with anticoagulants secondary to high clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism.  Even though the pulmonary arterial study was nondiagnostic, the patient was started on treatment secondary to findings of deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity.
Axial images of the chest demonstrate hypodensities within the pulmonary arteries distal to third order branching but was nondiagnostic secondary to beam hardening and motion artifact.

Axial images of the lower extremities demonstrate thrombosis of the right common femoral vein to the external iliac vein.
Deep Venous Thrombosis
Deep venous thrombosis
77 year old white male with history of malignancy with sudden onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain seven days into hospital admission for gastrointestinal bleed.
CT signs of thrombosis include "increased venous diameter, low-density intraluminal filling defects, and a surrounding rim of high density contrast medium."
The clinician's index of suspicion for pulmonary embolism was high in this patient.  Even though the pulmonary embolism
