Texto: 
Left shin numbness, left weak foot dorsiflexion.
CT should be promptly obtained if there is concern for leakage/rupture, as in the case of low back pain.

Typically, the risks of surgical correction begin to outweigh the risk of rupture when the lesion is over 5.0 cm in AP dimension, although treatment may be instituted at lesser sizes.
Lateral radiograph of the lumbar spine shows, in addition to mild multi-level disco-vertebral degenerative changes, a calcified aorta with aneurysm.

Ultrasound was used to assess aneurysm size.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm
Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
68 yom with low back pain.
