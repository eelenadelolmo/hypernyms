Decreased right hip range of motion.
Pt underwent surgical screw fixation of the femoral head.
AP and frog leg lateral views of the hips demonstrate asymmetric widening of the right proximal femoral physis.  The frog leg lateral views reveal minimal medial displacement of the right femoral epiphysis.  A line drawn along the superior aspect of the right femoral neck does not intersect the head as it does on the left.
