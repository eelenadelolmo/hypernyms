22 yo G3P1 woman who has a diagnosis of ‚Äúfibroadenomia" from an outside hospital.  Presented to the ED at 25 + 5 weeks with complaints of shortness of breath.
This patient presented path reports and mammograms that were obtained in Latin America and diagnosed earlier as ‚Äúfibroadenomia.‚Äù  

Last year, she was diagnosed (San Diego) with cystosarcoma  phyllodes, after presenting with right breast enlargement, that was hard and painful to palpation and lateral deviation of the nipple.  No family history of breast cancer.

This patient's age was unique to the published age group for unilateral cystosarcoma phyllodes of 40-50 yo age.  In addition, patient had an unusual painful presentation of phyllodes tumor.  It is unknown, however, if the pain was a product of multiple resections to the right breast or from the phyllodes tumor itself.
