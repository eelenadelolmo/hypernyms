Texto: 
Patient is 5â€™5â€™â€™ and weighs 125 lbs. Her blood pressure was 106/70 mmHg. Upon standing, patient is slumped on left side, with her left hip lower than the right.
Her ROM is as follows
Cervical spine- flexion 60/50, right rotation 75/80, left rotation 75/80, left and right lateral bending 25/45 and extension 50/60. Complaints of neck pain radiating to the shoulders was made when bending the neck laterally.
Shoulders and upper extremities were of normal ROM and strength bilaterally.
Thoracolumbar spine- flexion 50/90, left and right lateral bending 10/25 and extension 20/25.
These motions all produced lower back pain that radiated down her right leg.
Lower extremity muscle tests revealed weakened hip flexors on the right side. All else was within normal limits.
Reflexes of the biceps, triceps, patella and Achilles were all found to be 2/4.
Straight leg raise on the right could only be performed to 40 degrees, with report of low back pain that radiated down the right leg, extending to the mid calf.
Palpation of the cervical and lumbosacral regions of the spine revealed pain. Paraspinal muscle spasms were noted in these areas as well. These areas coincide with her limited ROM.
EMG testing revealed evidence of an active S1 radiculopathy.
No other abnormal findings were noted during physical examination.
The patient was referred to a chiropractor where she receives chiropractic manipulation, ultrasound therapy as well as strengthening exercises for the core and the lumbar extensors. Patient has also been referred for a surgery consultation and the neursurgeon suggested L5-S1 microdiscectomy however, the patient is hesitant to proceed with surgery and would rather continue conservative management at this time.
When initially brought in to ER after MVA, plain film radiographs were taken. These revealed a slight left lumbar concavity of curvature which is likely due to muscle spasms. No other osseous pathologies were noted.

The lumbar MRI revealed evidence of a small disc bulge at the L4-L5 level. There was also a right paracentral posterior disc herniation at L5-S1 level which effaces the thecal sac and compresses the S1 nerve root.
L5-S1 disc herniation with S1 radiculopathy
1.	Lumbar disc herniation
2.	Spinal fracture
3.	Muscle pain/spasms
4.	Spinal stenosis due to other causes
This full-time student was involved in MVA in eight months ago. She presented to the office with complaints of neck, shoulder and lower back pain that radiates down the legs. Her right leg pain is more severe than the left leg pain and sometimes feels numb and weak. She reports trouble sleeping and says that she feels lethargic throughout the day. She also feels physically weak and reports she has trouble moving normally.

On the day of the MVA, she was a belted, front seat passenger in a vehicle that was stopped.  She reports that the vehicle she was in was struck from behind by another vehicle.    She was taken to the emergency where she was released the same day. She states that there was no immediate pain, but as the day wore on, she began to feel neck and back pain.

Her past medical history is unremarkable and she denies any illnesses or previous accidents. She remains a full time student although she states that her symptoms have affected her ability to perform as she would like. She takes OCPs, but does not take any other medication or vitamins.

Patient has made gradual improvement over time with chiropractic care received.  She is a candidate for lumbar spinal surgery to stabilize the L5-S1 disc level, but at this time she prefers manual chiropractic adjustment. She takes no medications for her symptoms. She claims that over the counter pain medications do not relieve her pain and the prescription pain medications/ muscle relaxers that she has been given make her lethargic and do not help much either.

As noted in the video presentation the patient clearly demonstrates a limp of her right lower extremity on ambulation prior to chiropractic manipulation.  The second video demonstrates gait immediately following chiropractic manipulation.  As can be seen the limp is absent and the patient reports relief of lower extremity pain.  The chiropractic manipulation is rendered with the patient in the left sidelying position.  The right thigh of the patient is flexed to 90 degrees.  The doctor takes a lateral thigh to thigh contact on the patient.  The left hand of the doctor is applied to the posterior superior iliac spine and mammilary process of the fifth lumbar on the right side.  A rapid descent or body drop is applied in a thigh to thigh manner while the doctor applies a posterior to anterior thrust on the aforementioned anatomical areas.  A audible sound and palpatory movement are perceived. 

She receives chiropractic treatment twice a week in which the chiropractor manually adjusts the spinal alignment in order to relieve radiculopathy symptoms and pain caused by disc herniation. She states that after the adjustments, she feels considerable relief in both her pain and mobility symptoms.   As of this time, no other images have been taken to evaluate any changes that may have occurred with her spine.
