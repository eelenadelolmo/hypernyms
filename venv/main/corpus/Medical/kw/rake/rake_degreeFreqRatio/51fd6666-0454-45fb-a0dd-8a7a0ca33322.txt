Elevated serum calcium levels.
1.  Early ("thyroid phase") images demonstrate radiotracer within the thyroid gland with more intense uptake in the vicinity of the inferior aspect of left thyroid lobe.
 
2.  Delayed ("parathyroid phase") images demonstrate persistent increased radiotracer uptake in the vicinity of the inferior aspect of the left thryoid lobe at a level just superior to the left clavicular head.
 
3.  Tomographic (SPECT/CT) images of the neck were obtained, demonstrating a focus of abnormal delayed wash-out in the lower left neck at a level just superior to the head of the left clavicle.
