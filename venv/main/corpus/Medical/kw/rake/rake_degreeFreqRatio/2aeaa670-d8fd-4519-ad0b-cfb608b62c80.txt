Texto: 
Cardiac, chest, oropharynx, and neck exam within normal limits
No treatment or follow-up necessary
P/A- extra edge noted on right side of cardiac shadow

Lateral- signs of extrinsic posterior compression of airway superior to aortic arch
Extra or Enlarged Pericardial Fat Pad   
There is a left arch with soft tissue compression of the esophagus on lateral view consistent with a normal variant: left aortic arch with aberrant right subclavian.

PA/Lateral chest ordered for chronic cough for previous year, suspect GERD as etiology.
Aberrant vessels can lie posterior to esophagus.  In right arch, this may be an aberrant left subclavian.  With a left arch, this could be an aberrant right subclavian.  Other variations like double arch are generally more symptomatic, earlier in life.
