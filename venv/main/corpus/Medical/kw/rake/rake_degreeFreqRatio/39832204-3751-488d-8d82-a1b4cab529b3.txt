Texto: 
On exam (after her biopsy), she was noted to rebound tenderness, and the next day she was noted to have mild pancreatic enzyme elevation.  Her CBC and coagulation studies remained stable.

In an effort to identify the cause for her pain, an abdominal radiograph and an upper abdominal ultrasound was performed.  This was followed by a CT scan in an effort clarify the findings on ultrasound and to assess for procedural complications.
Currently, observation; she is not clinically bleeding and has stable vitals and labs.
â€¢ Abdominal radiograph demonstrates hyperdense appearance to the gallbladder.  The liver edge is well below the costal margin raising the suspicion for hepatomegaly.
â€¢ Ultrasound of the gallbladder demonstrates mixed echogenic material within the lumen of the gallbladder.  A small amount of free fluid was noted around the gallbladder.
â€¢ CT imaging reveals hyperattenuating non-enhancing cast-like material within the gallbladder lumen.  There is free fluid around the liver.
Hematobilia (Hemobilia)
â€¢ Chronic hepatitis with ascites
â€¢ Huge Gallstone with pericholecystic reactive fluid
â€¢ Hematobilia with hemoperitoneum and/or bile peritonitis
58 y.o. woman with chronic liver enzyme elevation (AST=114, ALT=145) who underwent ultrasound-guided random liver biopsy of the left hepatic lobe in her workup.  Prior to her biopsy, the etiology had not been identified (no evidence of viral hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and NASH) and normal platelet levels and coagulation labs were present.  Her biopsy procedure was uneventful, but several hours after her procedure, she complained of severe upper abdominal pain.
Presume this hematobilia was a result of liver biopsy - a known complication.  The patient's liver biopsy demonstrated "chronic hepatitis with prominent portal plasma cells."
