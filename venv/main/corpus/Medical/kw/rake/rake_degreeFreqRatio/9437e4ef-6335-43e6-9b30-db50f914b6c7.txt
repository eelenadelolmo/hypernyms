Solitary 1.4 cm annular eczematoid plaque on right shin
The initial lesion resolved with ultra-potent topical steroids. However, over the next 18 months, groups of red-brown papules occurred on the forehead and cheeks. Additional biopsies, tissue cultures, and TB complex PCR studies continued to support a granulomatous dermatitis with no evidence of infection or foreign bodies. The new lesions improved with topical and intralesional steroids. Ophthalmologic workup has shown no evidence of ocular involvement.
Tissue culture and PCR studies negative for infectious etiology.

Histopathology: The biopsy shows several naked granulomas without birefringent material within the dermis. Acid fast and fungal stains were negative.
