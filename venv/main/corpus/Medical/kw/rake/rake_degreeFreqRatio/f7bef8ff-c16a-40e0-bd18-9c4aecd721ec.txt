MR: Fatty mass above anterior aspect of Corpus Callosum.
Intracranial lipoma
Lipoma
Hematoma
52 year old male with TIA symptoms.
This case demonstrates the classic example of a curvilinear intracranial lipoma.  It is located along the midline with MR signal intensities following that of fat.  This was an incidental finding in this patient, and there were no other imaging abnormalities seen
