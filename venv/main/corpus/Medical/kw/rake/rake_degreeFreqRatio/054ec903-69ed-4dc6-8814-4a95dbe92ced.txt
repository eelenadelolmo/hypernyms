5.9 cm heterogeneously enhancing soft tissue mass with apparent left renal origin.
Left Renal Mass
Renal Cell Carcinoma
Oncocytoma
Angiomyolipoma
Xanthogranulomatous Pyelonephritis/Abscess
39 yo male presented with painless hematuria.
Surgical resection is indicated for further characterization of the solid renal mass, to determine malignancy.  In this case, based on the size of the mass (5.9cm) there is approximately a 90% chance that this is renal cell carcinoma [1].

However, there are benign lesions on the differential for solid renal masses that may be considered--oncocytoma being the most common.  They are usually distinguished on imaging by a central scar, but this is a nonspecific finding [2].  Angiomyolipoma is another benign solid renal mass, but are usually characterized on imaging by their fat density.  Further down on this differential is a xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis--a chronic pyelonephritis usually associated with renal stone infection that can cause cortical changes that mimic RCC.  But without a history of UTIs and evidence of an obstructing renal stone on CT, this diagnosis is very unlikely [3].
