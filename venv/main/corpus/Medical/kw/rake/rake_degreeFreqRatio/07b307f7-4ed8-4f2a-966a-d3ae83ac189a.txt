Pt is Tachypnic with RR of 30
Diffuse Crackles in lungs bilaterally
Clubbing noted in fingers
Prognosis is poor with average survival of 8-10 years. The mainstay of treatment is antiandrogen therapy most commonly oophorectomy. Patients with severe disease eventually require lung transplantation.
Increased interstitial  markings
Normal or slightly increased lung volume
"Mass" in aortico-pulmonary window
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis
DDx of Interstitial Pattern with normal to increased lung volumes --
1. COPD
2. Langerhans cell histiocytosis 
3. Pulmonary Tuberous sclerosis 
4. Sarcoidosis
5. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis
47 y/o non-smoking female with progressive dyspnea and cough for three years.
In a patient with cystic lung lesions on CT one must differentiate LAM from PLCH. In LAM the cysts are thin walled and diffusly seen throughout all lung fields. In PLCH which is caused by peribronchioler proliferation of langehrhan (dendritic macrophages) cells both thin and thick walled cysts are observed and the disease is seen primarly in the upper and middle lobes.
