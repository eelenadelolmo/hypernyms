First image is normal.

Second image is 2 weeks later and shows linear lucency through the base of the fifth metatarsal.
Fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal
Sub-acute fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal.
Foot pain after fall with persistent pain 2 weeks later.
This case emphasizes that fractures can be occult, but if there are persistent symptoms, follow up radiographs can show the fracture since resorption of bone at the fracture site is the first stage of healing.
