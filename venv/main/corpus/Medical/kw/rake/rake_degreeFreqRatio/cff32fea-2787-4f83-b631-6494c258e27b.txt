PHYSICAL EXAM:	1-3 mm discrete, adherent scales were found in all non- facial areas with a tendency towards larger numbers on the extremities. Photo-exposed areas on the dorsum of arms and wrists showed especially large scales which tended to coalesce into loose plaques. 
HISTOPATHOLOGY: Sections demonstrate multiple, discrete, focal areas of marked compact hyperkeratosis with mild epidermal hyperplasia and papillomatosis. There was no appreciable inflammation.
There was only minimal response to more aggressive emolliation and 12% ammonium lactate lotion. Epilyt was advised but it is not clear if the patient had a response to this. He was not interested in systemic retinoid or other more aggressive treatments at this time.
HYPERKERATOSIS LENTICULARIS PERSTANS (FLEGEL'S DISEASE)
(1997 Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, Case#12) submitted by: Jeffrey J. Meffert, LtCol USAF MC
presented to the troop clinic with the complaint of lifelong "dry skin". It had been progressively worsening over the last decade and did not respond to emollients. The skin was minimally pruritic with occasional burning discomfort. Family history was significant in that his mother has a similar dry skin problem.
