• Distended tubular bowel loops
• Intramural bowel wall lucencies, cystic and curvilinear patterns 
• Intramural gastric wall lucency, curvilinear pattern 
• Branched linear lucencies overlying hepatic shadow
• No free air

Small bowel obstruction
7 day old premature female twin
Extensive subserosal pneumatosis intestinalis which also involves the stomach, which is unusual. The bubbly cystic lucencies likely represent submucosal pneumatosis. The distended tubular loops of bowel are consistent with ileus due to necrotizing enterocolitis. Cross-table lateral radiograph shows no free intraperitoneal air in this patient who is at risk for perforation. 

Portal venous gas improved from 06APR films, although the resolution of PVG is not a indicator for improving clinical status, nor is it an indication for surgery as was once thought.
