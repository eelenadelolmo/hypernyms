Treatment depends on the extent of colonic inflammation, severity of symptoms, and other factors.1 Mild exacerbations involving inflammation of the rectum and left colon are treated with anti-inflammatory agents including sulfasalazine or mesalamine. Acute exacerbations of pancolitis may require oral steroids, and definitive treatment of ulcerative colitis is achieved with total colectomy. Indications for surgeries include treatment refractory to medication, desire for definitive treatment, and dysplasia found on endoscopic biopsy. Patients with ulcerative colitis are at increased risk for colon cancer, and require close observation including frequent colonoscopies although the timing of surveillance is controversial.2 American Gastroenterology Association recommends colonoscopies 8 years after initial diagnosis of pancolitis and 15 years if inflammation is confined to the left colon. The American College of Gastroenterology recommends colonoscopy at 8-10 years after diagnosis in surgical candidates. 2
Double contrast barium enema with prone and supine views indicating shortening of the colon and loss of haustral folds mimicking a lead pipe. Areas of ulceration of the mucosa are seen from rectum to cecum, they are continuous and become less prominent proximally. Contrast is seen passing through the ileocecal valve. The appendix was not seen.
