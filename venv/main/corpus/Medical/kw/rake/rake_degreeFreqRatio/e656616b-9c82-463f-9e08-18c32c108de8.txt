MRI BRAIN - Isointense to gray matter on T1 and T2 sequences, there are multiple soft tissue lesions within the bilateral cavernous sinuses right > left. These lesions enhance heterogeneously after the administration of GAD. On the right, one lesion extends inferiorly into the skull base adjacent to the sphenoid sinus (T2 CORONAL). Bilaterally, these lesions encase the cavernous carotid arteries (T1 SAGITTAL). There is no definite infiltration of the sella turcica/pituitary. There is no suprasellar extension. The optic chiasm is spared. The Circle of Willis is spared.
Bilateral Cavernous Sinus Metastatic Lymphoma
1. Metastatic Disease
2. Lymphoma
3. Meningioma
4. Sarcoid
5. Tolosa Hunt Syndrome (Granulomatous Infiltration And Inflammation Akin To Orbital Pseudotumor)
6. Invasive Pituitary Adenoma
59 year old man with new onset diplopia had a CT chest demonstrating mediastinal lymphadenopathy and multiple mass-like hypodensities in the liver. Rule out neoplasm.
