Normal chest examination
AP and lateral radiographs demonstrate a round metallic density overlying the superior mediastinum.
Esophageal foreign body - Coin ingestion
Esophageal vs. tracheal foreign body.
15 month old child who presents with coughing for several days and irritability.
The orientation of the metallic coin is consistent with a foreign body in the esophagus due to its orientation. Conversely, a foreign body in the TRACHEA typically would be seen oriented in the saggital plane. The reason for this is the presence of cartilage rings in the trachea that are incomplete in the posterior section, allowing the coin to distend this portion and orient in this fashion.
