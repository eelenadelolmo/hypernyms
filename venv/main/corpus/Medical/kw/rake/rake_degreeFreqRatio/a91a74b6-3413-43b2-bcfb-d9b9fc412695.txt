Texto: 
Symmetric, fleshy, skin colored nodules attached to a narrow stalk of soft tissue from the medial portion of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fifth digits.
Treatment consisted of a snip excision with electrodessication at the base of the soft tissue stalk
X-Rays of hands significant for bilateral small supernumerary rudimentary digits extending from the fifth proximal interphalangeal joint region medially, with tiny central ossification, attached by a narrow stalk of soft tissue. Soft tissue and osseous structures of the hands are otherwise normal.

Histopathology: The biopsy shows connective tissue with scattered eccrine glands, fatty tissue, neural proliferation, and cartilage.
Case 2, (27th Annual Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, 2003) FAMILIALPOLYDACTYLY (AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT BILATERAL POSTAXIAL POLYDACTYLY)
â€¢ traumatic neuroma
Full term infant with an uneventful spontaneous vaginal delivery and normal newborn examination. Father, paternal grandfather and aunt have a history of bilateral supernumerary digits.
