Texto: 
As this lesion is preocclusive,  patient was immediately heparinized and taken to surgery that day. He underwent uncomplicated left internal carotid endarterectomy with intraoperative findings confirming the angiographic findings.
Selected AP and Lateral views from left carotid angiography demonstrates severe attenuation of the left ICA estimated at >95%, approximately 1.5-2 cm in length and at the C3 level. The right internal carotid (not shown) was found to have only an estimated 30% stenosis.
Critical Left internal carotid artery stenosis (Angiographic string sign)
59 year old male with ischemic retinopathy on ophthalmologic examination. Prior duplex ultrasonography of the carotids demonstrated bilateral ICA stenoses estimated at 50-75% by velocity.
