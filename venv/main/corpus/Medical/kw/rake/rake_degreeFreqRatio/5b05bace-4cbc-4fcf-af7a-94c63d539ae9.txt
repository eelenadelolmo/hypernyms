Texto: 
Tenderness on palpation over medial aspect of left knee and mildly reduced range of motion that was  limited by pain.  Valgus testing was non-specific.
Treatment:  When symptomatic, the patients undergo rehabilitative therapy including rest, non-weight bearing and physical therapy.  Surgery with excision of the ossified mass and ligament repair is  reserved for  refractory cases.
Anteroposterior radiograph of the left knee shows ossification  medial to the medial condyle in the region of the medial collateral ligament. The femur and tibia were intact.
