Physical exam was unrevealing with normal lung exam and no adenopathy or palpable chest wall mass appreciated.
Laboratory examinations were  normal except for the  ESR which was raised 40/90.
The patient currently is undergoing combination therapy with 3 cycles of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and adriamycin.
Chest radiograph revealed a 2cm parietal-based mass in the lateral side of right hemi thorax, at the level of the middle arch of the third right rib.  

Four months later the chest plain films demontrates a 7 cm lobulated parietal-based opacity centered on the middle arch of the third right rib with cortical rupture and bone destruction of the affected area of the rib.

Thoraco abdomino pelvic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed an 8 x 7 centimeter right lateral chest wall mass with expansion, destruction and cortical spread out of the middle arch of the right third rib. This parietal mass   was   spontaneously   heterogeneous containing solid and necrotic areas and demonstrates intense contrast uptake in the solid portion   after injection .

Metastic lesions were identified  at L5 vertebral body with extension to the epidural, in the  lower lobe of left lung and in the left iliac wing.
Askin tumor of chest wall
Aside the possibility of Askin tumor, the differential diagnosis in case of aggressive rapidly growing chest wall mass could be an Ewing sarcoma a lymphoma, Osteosarcoma, Fibro sarcoma, Reticulum cell sarcoma, Histiocytosis X, Bone metastases, Sub acute or chronic osteomyelitis.
A 31-year-old male without significant past medical history presented to the emergency department at our institution with a 1 week history of fevers and  right-sided pleuritic chest pain. Additional history revealed   night sweats over the previous month, and a 10-pound weight loss over the two preceding months.
Primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the chest wall, also called "Askin tumors," are rare, highly malignant tumors that have traditionally been felt to occur only in the pediatric or young adult population. These tumors are often very large at the time of diagnosis. The most common manifestation of these tumors includes pain from mass effect, often of several months duration. Additional symptoms include progressive shortness of breath and dyspnea, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. For our patient the age was unusual (36 years) and the clinical manifestation was right chest wall pain and fever and weight loss   with 3 months later low back pain due to the secondary location in the lumbar spine and subsequent epidural invasion. 
 Radiographic studies are non-specific, but most often reveal a chest wall mass with local rib destruction and extension into the thoracic cavity. 
In the primary lesion evaluation, the priority is to obtain imaging studies of the suspected primary lesion or region with symptoms. If a bony mass is palpated, plain radiography is indicated. Ct scan and better MRI of the region can help to identify the extent of disease.
CT imaging is helpful to delineate any bony involvement. 
Tumors that are adjacent to critical neurological structures require immediate MRI scanning and consideration of emergent radiation therapy to prevent nerve damage. Magnetic resonance imaging often allows more accurate delineation and localization of the tumor and is helpful for determining the presence and extent of tumor invasion and for tissue characterization.
 Metastatic evaluation includes chest CT scanning and radioisotope bone scanning. If a tumor is likely based on initial study results, the chest CT scan is best obtained prior to surgical biopsy to avoid confusion with postoperative atelectasis. Metastases to both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary sites are common. In our case at least three secondary locations were noted in the left lung, in the left iliac bone and in  the lumbar spine with epidural invasion .

No pathognomonic or suggestive blood studies can be used to diagnose Askinâ€™s tumor. Depending on the patientâ€™s age and presenting symptoms, blood tests, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, blood culture, and complete blood cell count, might be helpful when considering other diagnoses.

The typical histological features include uniform sheets of round, blue cells with round nuclei, sparse cytoplasm, a high mitotic index, and Homer-Wright pseudo-rosette formation, Immunohistochemical staining most commonly reveals staining for neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and vimentine, both of which were positive in this case.   PNETs also have a cytogenetic translocation, t (11; 22)(q24; q12) that is shared with Ewing's sarcoma, and occurs in approximately 90% of the Ewing's--PNETs that can be evaluated, suggesting a common origin.   This genetic abnormality was not checked in this patient.
Aside the possibility of askin tumor, the differential diagnosis in case of aggressive rapidly growing chest wall mass could be an Ewing sarcoma a lymphoma, Osteosarcoma, Fibro sarcoma, Reticulum cell sarcoma, Histiocytosis X, Bone metastases, Sub acute or chronic osteomyelitis.
The radiographic findings are not specific and are the same   radiological features in many other malignant chest wall tumors such as Ewing sarcoma, lymphoma and metastasis however knowledge of the typical radiological manifestations of these tumors often enables their differentiation from benign chest wall tumors.
This patient's presentation was unusual  first for the age and second for the short duration of pleuritic chest pain prior to diagnosis and also the appearance of low back pain 3 months later that warned us for a secondary metastatic lesion.
