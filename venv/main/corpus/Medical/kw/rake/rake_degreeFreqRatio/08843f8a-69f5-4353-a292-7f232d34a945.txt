left Hemiplegia
Heart Murmur
Transesophageal Doppler revealed patent foramen ovale (PFO) with a right to left shunt.  The PFO was occluded by cardiology.  

Seven weeks later the patient the returned with some dizziness.  The focal neurological deficits had resolved.
• CT day 1 --hyperdense middle cerebral artery (HDMCA sign) suggesting intraluminal clot

• MRI day 1 -- Early cytotoxic edema and restricted diffusion consistent with acute right MCA infarct

• MRI 7 weeks later -- well developed MCA infarct with evidence of laminar necrosis
Paradoxic Embolization, patent foramen ovale, cerebral infarction
Acute middle cerebral artery embolus with infarct
Herpes encephalitis
Migraine
Seizure
22 year old woman awoke with left-sided weakness and a facial droop.  She is taking oral contraceptives.
Although the patient was on BCP's her coagulation studies were unremarkable.  It was determined that the most likely cause of the infarct was a cardiac embolus (HDMCA sign) resulting from PVO.
