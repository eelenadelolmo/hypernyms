â€¢ Neurologic exam prior to treatment
Left sided densely hemiparetic.
Left upper extremity muscle strength 1/5.
Left lower extremity muscle strength 0/5.
Right upper/lower extremity muscle strength 5/5.
Bilateral lower extremity deep tendon reflexes brisk 2+.

Labs:
TroponinI <0.04
CK Total 115
Total Cholesterol 150
Triglyceride 535
PT 10.8
INR 1.0
Hypercoagulopathy Lab work up was negative.

Additional tests:
Bilateral carotid duplex doppler was negative
Supportive measures and rehabilitation.
Thrombolytic therapy.


Neuro exam after tPA administration:
Pupils reactive bilaterally.
No change in muscle strength or reflexes.
Hyperdensity within the right middle cerebral artery.
Increased right sided cerebral edema.  Midline shift appreciated.
Cerebral infarction, hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign
Thromboembolic infart--arterial

Tumor
Traumatic edema
37 y/o Hispanic man with no prior medical history, presents with sudden and complete left hemiplegia and left facial droop as reported by family member.   Further details elucidated include that the patient had complained of a headache and 45 minutes later developed the hemiplegia while operating a vehicle.  Althought there was no motor vehicle accident an ambulance was called to the scene.

Upon arrival to the ER, the patient was initially conversive but suddenly became altered with vomiting and agitation.  The patient was intubated for airway protection.  His right side of the body remained very active.  A computed tomography of the head was performed immediately and it demonstrated no acute bleed.  With no other bleeding risks determined, the patient was administered tPA within two hours of the incident.  Subsequent head CT's performed during the patient's hospital course demonstrated the following findings discussed here.
More significance was given to the hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign early in the patient's clinical course.y.  As the contrast resolution of CT improved, a differential in density between the brain and the intracranial blood vessels became apparent.  

Currently, to consider the hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign to be positive, it must be hyperdense in relation to the contralateral middle cerebral artery.  Comparison to the density of the parenchyma of the brain is not enough.
