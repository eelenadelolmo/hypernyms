CT
 3-cm, soft tissue density mass within the left inferior meatus with extension into the left nasal passage.
 
-Scattered areas of calcification with remodeling of the bone.

-No definite osseous destruction.

-Mild mucoperiosteal thickening of the bilateral maxillary and frontal sinuses, as well as the ethmoidal air cells. 

MR

-Complex mass with heterogeneous signal characteristics and heterogeneous enhancement characteristics in the left nasal passage. 

-Interface with the left nasal lacrimal duct and superior most aspect of the left incisors. 

-Modeling of the surrounding osseous structures without evidence of destruction or infiltration.
Pleomorphic Adenoma
Nasal Vault Masses (Non-Aggressive)

-Sinonasal Polyp
-Inverted Papilloma
-Pleomorphic Adenoma
-Hemangioma (epistaxis)
-Pyogenic Granuloma (pedunculated lobular mass)
-Granuloma gravidarum (hemangioma of pregnancy) in women
-Hemangiopericytoma
-Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma
-Ectopic salivary gland
44 y.o. man presents with blockage of the left nasal airway.
Although pleomorphic adenomas are most commonly associated with the parotid and other salivary glands, a number of intranasal pleomorphic adeomas have been reported and commonly occur between 30 and 50 yrs of age.  As in this patient, the common presentation involves nasal obstruction.  In contrast, a report of epistaxis is also common.

On direct visualization this adenoma was typical for a pleomorphic adenoma and described as a smooth, glistening gray mass.

Malignant tumors should also be considered in the differential including cartilaginous tumors from the nasal septum (although this mass appeared to originate from the inferior nasal turbinate), squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarinoma.  Exicsional biopsy is diagnostic and therapeutic
