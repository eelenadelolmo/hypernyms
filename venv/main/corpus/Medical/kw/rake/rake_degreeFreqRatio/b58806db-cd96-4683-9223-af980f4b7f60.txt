Surgery and radiation
Mixed signal intensity mass in left frontal and parietal lobe with cystic components and surrounding edema.  There is mass effect with depression of the roof of the lateral ventricle.  There is irregular ring-like enhancement following contrast administration
Ependymoma
Glioma:
• Astrocytoma - diffuse, high-grade (GBM)
• Oligodendroglioma
• Ependymoma
• Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma
Gliosarcoma
DNET
Ganglioglioma
Abscess
6 year old girl with new onset headache and right leg weakness.
This is an unusual extraventricular supratentorial location for an ependymoma.  The fourth ventricle and spinal cord locations are far more commonly seen as the site of ependymomas.
