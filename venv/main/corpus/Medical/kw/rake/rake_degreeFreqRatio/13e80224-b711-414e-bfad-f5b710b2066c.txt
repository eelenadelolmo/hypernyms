Texto: 
Follow-up echocardiography or MR is recommended to evaluate aortic stenosis, regurgitation or other complications.  Patients are at high risk for endocarditis and should receive prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental or surgical procedures.
Contrast enhanced CT of the heart demonstrates a bicuspid aortic valve with thickening of the edge of the valve leaflets.  There is associated post-stenotic dilation of the ascending aorta.  

The patient was also noted to have a small muscular ventricular septal defect.
