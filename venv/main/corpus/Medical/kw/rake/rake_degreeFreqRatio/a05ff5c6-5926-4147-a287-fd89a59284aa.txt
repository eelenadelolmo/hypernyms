PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITALS: HR 142, RR 34, O2sat 88%
Decreased breath sounds on the left, absent breath sounds on the right.  ABDOMEN: normal bowel sounds, tender to palpation diffusely

Laboratory:  Non contributory
A diaphragmatic hernia repair was performed by CT surgery. Patient remained in hospital for one month at time of publication to recover from multiple traumatic injuries to include pelvic fractures, complex right upper extremity comminuted fractures.
CXR shows well defined soft tissue opacity in right lower hemithorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.

Single coronal reformat of chest CT with contrast demonstrates superior herniation of the liver into the chest due to hemidiaphragm rupture.
Diaphragmatic Rupture and liver herniation
Based on radiographic findings:

Herniation of liver with diaphragm rupture
Hydropneumothorax
Pleural effusion
Liver hematoma
