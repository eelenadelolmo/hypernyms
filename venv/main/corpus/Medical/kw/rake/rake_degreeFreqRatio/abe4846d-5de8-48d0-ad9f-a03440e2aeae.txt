Physical examination unrevealing.  EKG normal.
In addition to imaging, evaluation of an anterior mediastinal mass includes measurement of serum anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies, seen with thymoma, and AFP and beta-HCG seen with some malignant germ cell tumors (GCT). Patients with primary masses will usually undergo surgical resection. The presence of lymphadenopathy (implying lymphoma or metastatic disease) or elevated serum AFP or beta-HCG should prompt limited biopsy followed by oncologic consulation and chemotherapy or radiotherapy when appropriate. Resection of residual tumor will follow in some cases.

In this case the mature teratoma was resected successfully.
â€¢ PA and lateral chest radiographs:  Large, circumscribed anterior mediastinal mass abutting the ascending aorta, pulmonary artery, and left heart border.  No evident adenopathy or pleural effusion.  

â€¢ Contrast-enhanced chest CT:  Circumscribed, heterogeneous anterior mediastinal mass containing multiple components with fluid and fat attenuation - but no calcifications.  The mass abuts and displaces the thymus - but appears separate.  No adenopathy or evidence of local invasion.
Mediastinal Mature Teratoma
Â» The differential diagnosis for a child with a mediastinal mass on CXR includes:

â€¢  thymoma
â€¢  thymic carcinoid
â€¢  thymic carcinoma
â€¢  thymic cyst
â€¢  thymolipoma
â€¢  lymphoma
â€¢  germ cell tumors (including teratoma & seminoma)
â€¢  parathyroid adenoma
â€¢  lymphangioma
â€¢  intrathoracic goiter

Â» The most common of these are thymoma, germ cell tumor, substernal goiter, and lymphoma. All the other conditions are rare. 

Â» In this patient the CT appearance, especially the presence of fat, is highly specific for a teratoma.  

Â» Additionally, the lack of contiguity of the mass with the thyroid makes goiter very unlikely, the patient's female gender makes a malignant germ cell tumor unlikely, the absence of adenopathy elsewhere argues against lymphoma, and her age makes thymoma unlikely.
9 y.o. girl with several month history of dull, intermittent, substernal chest pain - relieved by sitting up and treated with NSAIDs.
