Conservative treatment of rib fractures includes pain management as well as incentive spirometry to prevent complications such as atelectasis. Shoulder injuries as indicated by the physical exam findings will be further evaluated with MRI and plain films of shoulder, especially around the acromioclavicular joint. In addition, the cervical spine will be examined through MRI to look for evidence of nerve root impingement that may be causing numbness and tingling in the arms. 

This patient has been following with his chiropractor receiving ultrasound therapy to the lower cervical region as well as chiropractic adjustments. 

Regarding his aortic aneurysm, the patient should continue to see his primary care provider for blood pressure control as this will help prevent further dilation of the aorta. Monitoring may be suggested, using MRI to evaluate changes in diameter over time. He was consulted to see a thoracic surgeon, though open or endovascular surgical correction is not suggested for ascending aortic aneurysms under 5.5 cm in diameter (1). Treatment of hiatal hernia is dependent on the patient‚Äôs symptoms. Patients with no symptoms of reflux are usually not advised to have surgery. Patients with sliding hiatal hernias with gastroesophageal reflux disease, such as this patient, are indicated for surgical correction of the hernia with fundoplication (2).

Rib fractures: posterior at left 3rd rib, laterally on left 5th-9th ribs. Incidental findings of ascending thoracic aneurysm, and hiatal hernia
Given this patient's recent history of motor vehicle accident we need to consider traumatic injury to ribs, chest and spine. This may include fracture, contusion, and sprains. Given the patient‚Äôs age, there may be elements of degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis or cervical disc herniation.

The incidental findings of aortic aneurysm and hiatal hernia on CT are likely not caused by trauma. However chronic hypertension, age and previous injury to the aorta all put this patient at risk for aneurysmal dilatation of the aorta (10). Traumatic injuries such as transection, aneurysmal hematoma and pseudoaneurysm may be ruled out by CT testing. The hiatal hernia is likely an incidental finding, especially given the patient‚Äôs history of acid reflux. Loss of elasticity and muscle weakening due to normal aging and male gender put this patient at risk for hiatal hernia. In addition, up to 60% of the individuals over 60 years of age have hiatal hernias.
Patient is a 64 year old African American gentleman who was in a motor vehicle accident one month prior to examination. He was waiting in the left turn lane when he was struck from behind by another vehicle. He described that he hit his chest on the steering wheel, and his airbag was not deployed. The patient was wearing a seatbelt during this accident. He described feeling immediate chest pain, neck pain and shoulder pain. He denies any loss of consciousness or blood loss. He was taken to the emergency room where he was examined, radiographs and ultrasounds were performed, and ibuprofen was prescribed for pain.

Since the time of the accident the patient complains of having continued chest pain. He describes the pain as being on his left side, spanning from his left midclavicular line, laterally and into his shoulder and upper back. He describes the pain as a continuous sharp pain, as if he is being stabbed, that is usually brought on by movement. He also describes a few incidences of feeling painful pressure, usually when he is trying to move or bend. He said that his pain is aggravated by movement and deep breathing and is improved by prescription medications such as hydrocodone, lying on his back or right side. He describes that he has been sleeping in his recliner frequently to avoid pain felt on the left side of his chest. He describes that the pain feels worse first thing in the morning. Currently he rates the pain as being 4-5/10, but at it‚Äôs worst he says that it reaches a 7/10 daily. He has been working as a machinist for 11 years and has not worked since this accident. 

The patient denies any headaches. He denies any loss of bowel or bladder control. He does have some loss of appetite, anxiety and sleep loss since the accident. He mentions that he has some numbness and tingling in his left arm. 

Past Medical History
The patient also has a history significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, alcohol abuse, a one year history of a pinched nerve in his neck that causes occasional shooting shoulder pain, and a three year history of acid reflux. He takes amlodipine, benzaprine, low dose aspirin, and multiple vitamins. He has had surgery in the past for a stab wound to the chest and for a hernia repair. His family history is significant for alcoholism and cirrhosis, hypertension and diabetes mellitus.

This patient‚Äôs rib injuries prompted him to receive further imaging that revealed an aortic aneurysm and hiatal hernia on CT scanning. These injuries are not commonly linked with trauma, and are likely incidental findings which can now be addressed and followed. 

A hiatal hernia occurs when abdominal contents protrude above the level of the esophageal hiatus in the diaphragm. There are two types of hiatal hernias : the more common type is a sliding hiatal hernia. Sliding hernias occur when the gastroesophageal junction is displaced above the diaphragm. This is the type of hernia this patient has. The second and less common type of hiatal hernia is a  paraesophageal or rolling hiatal hernia, where the gastroesophageal junction remains in its normal location below the diaphragm and another portion of the stomach bulges through the esophageal hiatus (3). It is suggested that 5-10% of hiatal hernias may be result of trauma or injury (4). Traumatic diaphragmatic hernias, caused frequently by motor vehicle accidents or fall from height, most commonly protrude through the left hemidiaphragm as it is not protected by the liver (5).

The esophageal hiatus is the most vulnerable opening through the diaphragm as it is the only opening that directly connects the thoracic and abdominal compartments. In addition, the esophagus does not completely fill the opening so that there is room for expansion of the esophagus as food is swallowed (6). This allows the gastroesophageal junction or parts of the stomach to pass upward through the opening of the diaphragm. Hiatal hernias may occur due to congenital weakness or abnormalities in the hiatus, and are sometimes caused by persistent and intense abdominal pressure such as chronic coughing, repetitive vomiting, straining to pass bowel movements, or lifting weights (7). 

Certain conditions may predispose a patient towards the development of a hiatal hernia. This includes muscle weakening and loss of elasticity as a part of normal aging (8). In addition, conditions that increase intraabdominal pressure such as pregnancy, obesity, or abdominal ascites may increase a patient‚Äôs risk for developing hernia. There is also some suggestion that hiatal hernia is more common in men than in women (9).

Most patients with hiatal hernias are asymptomatic, however the individual may be predisposed to reflux or have worsened gastric reflux symptoms after herniation occurs (8). The patient may describe an acidic or sour taste in their mouth or complain of increased  belching, difficulty swallowing or heartburn (8). In some cases patients may have complications due to the hernia which include intermittent bleeding from ulcers associated with esophagitis, erosions or ulcers; this may cause anemia. In addition, in paraesophageal hernias the hernia may incarcerate, though this is a rare occurrence. (8) Treatment of sliding hiatal hernias should be correlated with symptoms. If a patient is having symptoms such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, surgical correction of hernia with fundoplication is suggested (2).

An ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm is another important finding that was noted on this patient‚Äôs imaging. Thoracic aortic aneurysm is defined as  a dilatation of the thoracic aorta greater than 4 cm at any portion, and occurs most commonly in the ascending aorta. True aneurysms occur when all three layers of the aorta (tunica intima, tunica media and tunica externa) are dilated (10). Morphologically, true aneurysms have a fusiform shape, meaning that there is uniform and symmetrical dilation of the entire circumference of the aortic wall (10). Thoracic aneurysms can be further classified by the region which is dilated : ascending aortic, descending aortic, and aortic arch aneurysms (10). Ascending aortic aneurysms occur between the aortic annulus and the more distal innominate artery. Descending aortic aneurysms occur distal to the left subclavian artery.

The tensile strength of the aorta is mostly contained in the medial layer. Structural proteins such as collagen and elastin are most essential to this function (10). Disruption of these proteins, such as in Marfan‚Äôs disease or Ehlers-Danlos disease, increases risk of aneurysm. Other diseases that increase risk of aneurysm include Loeys-Dietz syndrome, late stage syphilis, takayasu‚Äôs disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Hemodynamic factors are also involved with the formation of aortic aneurysms and this is best explained by Laplace‚Äôs law. This law explains that the arterial wall tension is proportional to the pressure times the radius of the artery. Increased pressure such as those found in systemic hypertension increases wall tension and aggravates aneurysm, increasing the radius. Once radius is increased this acts to increase wall tension and increases risk of rupture or dissection. (10). 

Thoracic aortic aneurysms typically are asymptomatic and are frequently found incidentally on imaging for other causes. When they do present, symptoms include interscapular back pain or central chest pain (11). If the aneurysm compresses the esophagus it may cause dysphagia and weight loss (11). Aneurysms in the ascending aorta may also compress the trachea and descending airways.

In patients with mild to moderate dilatation of the aorta, under 5.5 cm in the ascending aorta, it is appropriate to manage true aortic aneurysms medically with blood pressure medications such as beta-blockers. Controlling blood pressure helps prevent further dilatation of the aorta. In the case of severe dilatation of the aorta, 5.5 cm or greater in ascending aorta, surgical intervention is indicated. Repair may involve open thoracic surgery or endovascular repair with similar success rates (1).

As opposed to true aneurysms where all three layers of the aortic wall are dilated, pseudoaneurysms (or false aneurysms) and transections of the aorta may occur in a traumatic injury with blunt trauma to the chest. Pseudoaneurysm, is a dilatation of the aorta where there is an out-pouching of the vessel wall due to a deficiency in the tunica media and intima, and less commonly weakness within the adventitia (12). These aneurysms tend to have a saccular shape with a localized out-pouching of the aortic wall (10). Traumatic aortic injuries such as transection usually present with rapid onset hemodynamic instability, retrosternal chest pain, referred interscapular pain, dyspnea, hoarseness and cough (13).  Symptoms are thought to be caused by increased mediastinal pressure and stretching of the structures in the mediastinum. The survival rates after traumatic aortic injury such as those sustained in a vehicular accident are low, with mortality rates estimated between 80-90% (13).  In the case of this gentleman the ascending aortic aneurysm is considered pre-existing to the MVA and likely not aggravated by such.  The esophageal slide may also be pre-existing to the MVA but based on the significant trauma, seat belt usage and increased abdominal pressure associated with the MVA  symptoms can be aggravated.
