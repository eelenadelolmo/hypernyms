Sagittal right upper quadrant ultrasound images (Film 1) demonstrate a large gallstone within the gallbladder.  It has a characteristic appearance, a bright hyperechoic rim representing the portion of the gallstone closest to the transducer with a sharp well-defined distal sonic or acoustic shadow.  The gallbladder wall is thickened, measuring 10 to 12 mm (denoted by x's, Scan 2); the normal gallbladder wall should not be more than 3 mm in thickness.  Note the linear zones of decreased echogenicity within the gallbladder wall, representing areas of edema.  There is no pain when scanning over the gallbladder.
Cholelithiasis with no symptoms of cholecystitis.  Gallbladder wall thickening (edema), caused by hepatitis A.
This 49-year-old female presented with jaundice, general malaise, and a serologic diagnosis of hepatitis A.  Physical examination of the right upper quadrant is unremarkable.  Liver function tests are abnormal, with an elevated total serum bilirubin of 10 mg/dl (normal is 0.2 to 1.2).  The white blood cell count and differential count are normal.  An ultrasound examination of the right upper quadrant (Film 1) is performed.  What is your diagnosis?
In patients with the clinical findings of right upper quadrant tenderness and fever, an elevated white blood cell count, and ultrasound findings of a gallstone and wall thickening, a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis should be strongly considered.  However, this patient had no clinical and laboratory findings to support this diagnosis. 

Aside from diabetic and immune-suppressed patients who may present atypically with acute cholecystitis, one must consider other causes of gallbladder wall thickening, which include chronic cholecystitis, a contracted gallbladder in a nonfasting patient, hypoalbuminia from any cause, ascites surrounding the gallbladder, hyperplastic cholecystoses, carcinoma of the gallbladder, and hepatic fluid overload with secondary gallbladder wall edema.  

Processes in this hepatic fluid overload category include hepatitis, severe congestive heart failure, or mass lesions in the porta hepatitis obstructing the lymphatic drainage of the liver.  All of these cause edema of the liver and secondary gallbladder wall edema and thickening.  This patient was found on serologic evaluation, to have hepatitis A, undoubtedly the cause of the edema of the gallbladder wall.  Other features of hepatitis which may be visualized sonographically include hyperechoic halos around the portal veins due to periportal edema secondary to the hepatitis and liver enlargement.
