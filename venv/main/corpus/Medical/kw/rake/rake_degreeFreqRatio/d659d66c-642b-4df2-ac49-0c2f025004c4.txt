ABDOMINAL AORTA:  There is narrowing of the abdominal aorta, both above and below the renal arteries.  The superior mesenteric artery is occluded at its origin, and not seen on the lateral view.  There is a large Arc of Riolan from the IMA, which reconstitutes the SMA distribution.  The celiac axis is patent, however, there is a 50% stenosis at the origin.  There are single renal arteries bilaterally, both of which demonstrate stenoses.  On the right, there is a long segment stenosis with approximately 50% narrowing.  On the left, there is 60% to 70% stenosis at the origin of the vessel, extending to an early bifurcation, with an early upper pole branch.  This is also stenotic at its origin.
