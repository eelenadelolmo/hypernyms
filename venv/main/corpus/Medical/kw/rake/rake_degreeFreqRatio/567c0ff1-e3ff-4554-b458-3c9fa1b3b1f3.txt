Texto: 
Tenderness to palpation over left posteriour ilium, with no mass noted. No spinal or paraspinal tenderness. 

5/5 strength and normal sensation to light touch throughout both lower extremities. 
2+ reflexes to bilateral knees and ankles. No Babinski.
The patient underwent surgical excision of the mass which was uncomplicated.
Circumscribed multilobulated bony exostosis arising from the lateral aspect of the upper left ilium.  This lesion appears to have cortical and medullary contiguity with the ilium.
Osteochondroma
- Osteochonrdoma
- Enchondroma
- Post-traumatic change
23 yo male who initially presented to the emergency department with epigastric pain. Abdominal plain films were obtained wich showed an incidental finding of a bony mass arising from the left iliac wing.  

On questioning he endorses a several year history of atraumatic left posterior buttocks pain. This pain is worsened by bending or strenuous running.
This patient's presentation is fairly typical for a deep osterochondroma. He fits the typical demographic of a male with the tumor arising in the second decade of life. The fact that it was found incidentally is not surprising given the tumor's deep location. It was not palpable on exam even with its location known. Had it been more superficial, painful or disabling it is likely the patient would have presented earlier.

Though observation without treatment is a perfectly acceptable option, surgical management is recommended for symptomatic lesions.
