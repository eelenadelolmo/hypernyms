Physical exam showed tenderness to palpation over the proximal one third of the right anterior tibia.

Initial plain films were normal.  Bone scan conducted one week after initial plain films showed focal linear increased up-take in the proximal one third in the tibial diaphysis.  Plain films obtained approximately one month after initial presentation showed a mild periosteal reaction at the site of the stress fracture.
