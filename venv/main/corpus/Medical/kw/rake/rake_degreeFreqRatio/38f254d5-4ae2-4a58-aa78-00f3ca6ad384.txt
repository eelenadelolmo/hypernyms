Transverse colon lies above the level of the diaphragm, anterior to the heart and predominantly medial.  No surrounding inflammatory change.  Free passage of enteric contrast.
Morgagni Hernia (adult, incidental)
This is a classic location for a Morgagni's hernia, anterior and medial.  This was small, no complications during fetal development (i.e Pulmonary hypoplasia).  The main concern now is incarceration/strangulation, though there is no evidence complication on this CT.
