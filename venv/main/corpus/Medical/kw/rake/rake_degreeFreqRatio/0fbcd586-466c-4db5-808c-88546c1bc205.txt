Non-contributory
No treatment required
There is a soft tissue mass posterior to the stomach.  On the non-contrast images, this does not definitively communicate with the stomach.  The CT images with contrast demonstrate filling with the oral contrast, verifying the diagnosis.
Gastric diverticulum
Gastric diverticulum
Accessory spleen
Adrenal mass
46 year old male had a non-contrast CT scan looking for a urolith.  An incidental finding was noted, followed by a CT scan with oral contrast.
This gastric diverticulum was incidentally noted and is unlikely to possess clinical significance. A gastric diverticulum can be a "fake out" lesion, simulating other entities.
