Resection and curretage.
Radiographs demonstrate a well-defined lucent lesion with a narrow zone of transition involving the calcaneus located in the middle to anterior third.

MRI demonstrates low signal intensity on T1-weighted and high signal intensity on T2-weighted Inversion Recovery (STIR) imaging. Post-gadolinium images demonstrate no enhancing component. An incomplete small bony septum is present in the superior/anterior aspect of the lesion.

Patient with recurrent right foot pain.
Simple bone cysts are common benign lesions involving the medullary cavity. More than 90% occur in the long tubular bones (frequently metaphaseal) in patients under 20. After age 20, half of all lesions are found in the innominate bone and calcaneus. They are of unknown etiology. They more commonly affect males (2:1) and typically present before age 20. Although most often symptomatic, the most common complication of a simple bone cyst is a pathologic fracture. When they involve the epiphyseal growth plate, subsequent growth arrest/retardation can occur. Recurrence rates are high in children under the age of 10. Treatment involves curettage and bone grafting. Alternatively, in cysts with no internal septum/loculations, injected corticosteroids have demonstrated some promise for treatment.
