Premarture infant female, on 1LNC and OG tube feedings
PICC in LUE
Afebrile
PICC was withdrawn and replaced
10 day course of abx (vanc/cefotaxime) for NEC
Diffuse bowel gas pattern, thickened bowel wall, consistent with previous diagnosis of NEC

PICC line in LUE with tip terminating on left side of mediastinum
LUE PICC with tip in descending aorta
PICC line misplacement - arterial catherization
Aberrant anatomy (i.e. persistent left SVC emptying into left atrium)
Infant female day of life 43, currently in NICU s/p delivery at gestation age of 26week three days.  

Persistent cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and feeding problems.  

Now with new onset increased gastric reflux, deteriorating respiratory status, diagnosed as NEC secondary to pneumatosis intestinalis on previous radiograph, disease course being followed radiographically.
This case demonstrates the importance of confirming all line placements.
