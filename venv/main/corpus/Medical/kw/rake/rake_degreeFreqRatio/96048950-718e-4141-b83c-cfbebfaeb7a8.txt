Texto: 
Patient underwent transvaginal hysterectomy
Ultrasound demonstrated heterogenous uterus.  There were no fibroids.  MRI of the pelvis confirmed suspicion of adenomyosis.  T2 sequence demonstrates thickening of junctional zone and increased focal signal through out the myometrium.
Adenomyosis
36 yo female presents with intermenstrual bleeding for several month.  The bleeding is now increased in the amount with cramping.
