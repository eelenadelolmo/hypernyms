Correct hypophosphatemia and / or Vit D abnormalities.
Distal femoral metaphyseal widening, fraying and cupping.
Rickets
1.  Abnormal vitamin D metabolism secondary to; deficiency, malabsorption, inadequate dietary intake, inadequate sunlight 
2. Hepatic origin: anticonvulsant therapy (increased hepatic metabolism), liver disease (failure of 25 hydroxylation) 
3. vit D dependent rickets 
4. parathyroid disorders (hypo, hyper, pseudohypo)
5. maternal renal insufficiency as a cause of congenital rickets and secondary hyperparathyroidism. 
6. Phosphate loss due to renal tubular disorders 
7. vit D resistant rickets: X-linked hypophosphatemia 
8. Fanconi syndrome 
9. renal tubular acidosis 
10. Tumor related -hemangiomas of the bone or soft tissue -metastatic neuroblastoma Dietary calcium deficiency
One and a half year old with short stature.
