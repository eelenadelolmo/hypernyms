Sonographic images of the pylorus demonstrate the hypertrophied hypoechoic pyloric muscle, with echogenic mucosa.  The length of the pyloric channel is 2.1 cm, and the pylorus is abnormally thickened, measuring 3.2 mm.  Additionally, there is a normal SMV/SMA relationship, and the duodenum is noted to cross midline, passing posteriorly to the SMA and is anterior to the aorta.
