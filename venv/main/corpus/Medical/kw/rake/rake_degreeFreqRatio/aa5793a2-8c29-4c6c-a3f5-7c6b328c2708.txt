Patient is approximately 8 weeks pregnant by LMP. Beta-HCG 3 days ago was 800 mIU/mL and current Beta-HCG is 846 mIU/mL.
Ultrasound of reproductive structures demonstrates normal appearing coronal and sagital views of the uterus with no evidence of intrauterine pregnancy. Evaluation of the right lower quadrant demonstrates a 1.35 X 1.5 X 1.69 cm mass adjacent to the right ovary. Color Doppler demonstrates marked hyperemia of the structure. The right fallopian tube is unable to be identified.
