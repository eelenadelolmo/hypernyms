Texto: 
Soft left neck ovoid lesion in the anterolateral lower neck. 
Labs the day prior to imaging. 
WBC 5.2 K/UL
ESR 8 MM/HR
Pathology report: Squamous epithelial-lined cyst with 
prominent chronic inflammation consistent with brachial cleft cyst.
None.
Ultrasound.  Hypoechoic ovoid lesion with internal mobile debri with enhanced through transmission.

CT:  Large, well-defined cystic lesion in perimandibular space with a faint, slightly irregular rim of enhancement betwen the anterior border of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. No evidence of carotic artery splaying that is typical for second branchial cleft cyst.
Branchial cleft cyst
thymic cyst
thryoglossal cyst
cystic nerve sheath tumor
cystic schwannoma
abscess
necrotic adenopathy
The patient reports having mononucleosis in September with diffuse cervical adenopathy.  In December she reports resolution of cervical lymphadenopathy and malaise but complains of an enlarging non-tender anterior neck mass over the last two weeks.  She denies trauma to her neck.
Presentation after infectious mononucleosis may have more that a casual relationship.  It may have percipitated progressive inflammation of the branchial cleft cyst.
