Physical exam was unremarkable.  No complaints by the patient.  Lab values remarkable for elevation in serum alkaline phosphatase.  Cardiac exam normal.
The case is newly diagnosed.  Pharmacologic treatment to begin shortly. Calcitonin, diphosphonate and mithramycin are common agents utilized for this condition.
Lateral skull film demonstrates osteoporosis circumscripta.  Clavicles (only the left is shown) demonstrate trabecular and cortical thickening with expansion. Lateral lumbar spine film demonstrates slightly enlarged and square vertebral bodies with peripheral thick trabeculae and inner lucency.
