Well nourished teenage girl with normal secondary female sexual characteristics. External female genitalia demonstrate normal labia with vaginal agenesis
Medical and surgical care are essential for fertility, capacity for sexual intercourse, and genital appearance.
-->The most common nonsurgical option for vaginal aganesis is the Frank Technique or perineal dilation
-->The most common surgical procedure for vaginal reconstruction is the McIndoe technique.

For patient who have a rudimentary uterus, removal is suggested if hematometra develops.

Patients should be monitored closely on how well they comply with surgical or nonsurgical dilation regimens.
It would also be beneficial for patient to be seen by an endocrinologist, geneticist, urologist and psychologist.
