Non-focal neurologic examination.
CT: A hyperdense mass infiltrating and widening the splenium of the corpus callosum. A poorly defined subtle hypodense lesion at the level of the right basal ganglia that causes leftward midline shift and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.

MRI: A poorly defined T2 hyperintense lesion infiltrating and widening the splenium of the corpus callosum with an additional focus at the level of the right basal ganglia that causes leftward midline shift. Vasogenic edema in the right posterior cerebral hemisphere. The mass has mild, irregular enhancement.
Glioblastoma Multiforme with Gliomatosis Cerebri
• Glioblasatoma multiforme 
• Gliomatosis cerebri
• Multiple sclerosis
• Lymphoma
• Metastatic disease
56 y.o. woman with vague neurological symptoms such as headache and lethargy that were increasing over a few weeks.
