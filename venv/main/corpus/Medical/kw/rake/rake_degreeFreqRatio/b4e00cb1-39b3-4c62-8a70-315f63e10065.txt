Texto: 
Slight ecchymosis and edema of the proximal right upper extremity without gross or palpable deformity.  Neurovascular structures intact.
The patient was referred to the orthopedics department for casting of her closed fracture.
Plain radiographs right shoulder and humerous demonstrate a nondisplaced pathologic fracture through a nonaggressive-appearing lytic lesion in the proximal metaphysis of the right humerus.

Plain radiographs obtained approximately one month prior to the pathologic fracture demonstrates that the lytic lesion is central and metaphyseal in location, abuts the adjacent growth plate, is minimally expansile, is well circumscribed (narrow zone of transition) and is without associated periosteal reaction.
Unicameral (solitary or "simple") bone cyst, pathological fracture
Unicameral (solitary) bone cyst
Aneurysmal bone cyst
Eosinophilic granuloma
