Tenderness and erythema on hypothenar region.
Immobilization for 6 weeks.
Minimally displaced fracture of the superolateral pisiform.
Pisiform fracture
None
32 year old male with fall onto outstretched hand.
Albeit rare, the pisiform fracture can be easily missed unless there is a high index of suspicion.  Additional views such as the reverse oblique view of the wrist (described by Alinok) or a carpal tunnel view as in this case is useful.  If plain films are equivocal, an MRI can be performed for confirmation.
