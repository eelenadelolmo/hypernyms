This is an incidental finding; no treatment is necessary.
Incidental finding on UGI study of a smooth contrast filled outpouching without signs of ucleration such as shouldering or contour irregularity.
Gastric diverticula
Gastric diverticula
Long standing history of GERD now with increasing symptoms despite proton-pump inhibitor therapy.
The endoscopist should be informed of it's presence prior to endoscopy because of an increased chance of rupture of the wall of the stomach during the procedure
