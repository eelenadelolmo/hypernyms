CHURG-STRAUSS SYNDROME (1997 Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, Case#16) Captain D. Schissel, MC, USA
Patient evaluated for renal insufficiency (bun/creat : 23/1.7), proteinuria (1140mg/24hrs), and microscopic hematuria. He was apparently well until 8 weeks earlier when he developed a papulovesicular facial rash while on active duty in the Persian Gulf. He was treated for "acne" with tetracycline for 10 days with minimal improvement. He then took ibuprofen for several days for muscular back pain. He sought medical attention shortly after he returned to the U.S. due to progressive fatigue, rash, low grade fevers, weight loss, "clumsiness" and inability to concentrate. Other than albuterol and triamcinolone inhalers that he used for chronic well-controlled asthma, he took no other medications, and was previously healthy. There was no prior history or family history of renal disease or urinary abnormalities. There was no gross hematuria, arthritis, oral ulcerations, sinusitis, HA, hemoptysis, cough, chest or abdominal pain or SOB.
