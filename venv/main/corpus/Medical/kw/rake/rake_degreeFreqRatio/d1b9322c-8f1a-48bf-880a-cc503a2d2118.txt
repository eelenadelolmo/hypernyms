Texto: 
CT with contrast demonstrating an intra-axial cystic mass in the posterior fossa, eccentric on the left.  Effaces the 4th ventricle with minimal mass effect at the cerebello-pontine angle.  Enhancing mural nodule on the anteromedial aspect.  Mild dilation of the 3rd and lateral ventricles.
Giant Cell Ependymoma
Hemangioblastoma
Astrocytoma
Metastatic disease (e.g. lung carcinoma)
89 year-old man presented complaining of dizziness and lightheadedness for several months.  He has a history of "arrythmia" treated with an implanted cardiac pacemaker.
This case carried a preoperative diagnosis of hemangioblastoma.  Everyone was quite surprised at the final pathology - a variant of ependymoma.
