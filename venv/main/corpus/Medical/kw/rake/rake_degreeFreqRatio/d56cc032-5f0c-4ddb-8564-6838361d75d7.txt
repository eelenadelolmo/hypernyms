Texto: 
No jugular venous distention.
Lungs clear to auscultation.
No pedal edema.
Elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 1798 pg/ml (normal is 0.0-100.0) which has been shown to be elevated in failing and hypertrophied hearts as well as in amyloidosis.
IgG lambda monoclonal gammopathy with an IgG of 1352 mg/dL.
In patients presenting with heart failure and amyloidosis of the heart, the average life expectancy is less than one year.  Cardiac transplantation may be considered as a treatment option.
Dual Isotope Exercise Stress Myocardial Perfusion Scintigraphic images demonstrate reversible perfusion defects in the anterior and inferolateral myocardium consistent with ischemia.  The left ventricle shows reversible dilatation on the stress images.  The gated left ventricular ejection fraction on this exam was calculated at 27% (normal greater than 45%), and  the left ventricle demonstrated global hypokinesis.

Repeat Dual Isotope Exercise Stress Myocardial Perfusion Scintigraphic images obtained two months after the first set do not show any evidence of ischemia; however, the left ventricular reversible dilatation, reduced ejection fraction, and global hypokinesis persisted.  Radiotracer uptake around the heart and within the right ventricle is more prominent on this exam.
 
Technetium-99m Pyrophosphate Scintigraphic images demonstrate diffuse increased myocardial uptake of Tc-99m pyrophosphate.  Normal radiotracer uptake is present in the ribs, sternum, and spine.
 
ECG demonstrates a general low voltage which is consistent with an infiltrative process.
Cardiac Amyloidosis
Myocarditis
Pericarditis
Cardiomyopathy
Amyloidosis
Radiation Therapy 
Persistent blood pool activity (occurs if images are taken too early before complete clearance from the blood takes place)
Doxorubicin (Adriamycin therapy)
The patient presented with complaints of dyspnea.  He underwent a stress echo that revealed an ejection fraction of 60%, asymmetric septal hypertrophy, and evidence of ischemic inferior left ventricular dysfunction.  He underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed two critical stenoses in the right coronary artery and circumflex artery.  These stenoses were stented.  Subsequent stress thallium exam demonstrated continued evidence of inferior ischemia with significantly reduced left ventricular dysfunction.  A second cardiac catheterization revealed only luminal irregularities with both stents patent.  The stress thallium was repeated and showed no perfusion abnormalities; however, left ventricular dilatation was observed.  A stress echo was then performed which showed mild to moderate global dysfunction and possible inferior wall ischemia.  The patient returned for follow up and complained of an unintentional weight loss of 30 pounds, a poor appetite, loss of taste, and impotence.  His EKG at that time showed a very low voltage consistent with an infiltrative process.  A buccal mucosa biopsy was performed which was strongly positive for amyloid deposition.  A technetium pyrophosphate study was ordered which revealed diffuse cardiac uptake which was consistent with amyloidosis.
This patient most likely has the primary idiopathic form of amyloidosis (AL) based on the fact that he has an associated IgG lambda monoclonal gammopathy .  Cardiac symptoms are most common in the primary and heredofamilial amyloidoses.  It is rare to get cardiac symptoms in the secondary (AA) form of the disease.  The patientâ€™s poor ejection fraction, thickened ventricular walls on echocardiography, and global ventricular hypokinesis are all consistent with cardiac amyloidosis.  The low voltage QRS complex on his ECG is consistent with the disease as well.  Recent studies have associated an elevated brain natriuretic peptide level (BNP) with amyloidosis.  This patientâ€™s BNP level was excessively elevated at  1798 (normal 0-100).  The Tc PYP study showed diffuse uptake of Tc PYP in the heart which is further evidence supporting amyloidosis.  One must remember that diffuse uptake of  Tc PYP in the heart is a nonspecific finding for amyloidosis and may also be seen with myocarditis, pericarditis, cardiomyopathies, radiation therapy, persistent blood pooling, and doxorubicin therapy.  The fact that the patientâ€™s symptoms fit with a global process and that his buccal mucosa biopsy was positive for amyloid deposition are yet further evidence confirming a diagnosis of amyloidosis.
