There is a 7.6 X 5.9cm predominantely hypodense lesion present within the medial aspect of the right lobe of the liver which demonstrates mild peripheral enhancement on post-contrast images. There is no associated intrahepatic ductal dilatation and the hepatic and portal veins are patent.
On PET imaging, this lesion demonstrates marked FDG uptake, with a maximum SUV (standard uptake value) of 10.8.

HCC
Metastatic lesion
Abscess
A 75 year old male with an incidental liver lesion seen on a prior chest CT which was obtained to evaluate a questionable upper lobe opacity.
