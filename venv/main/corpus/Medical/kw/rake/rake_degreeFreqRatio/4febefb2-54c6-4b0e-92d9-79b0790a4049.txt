She can follow commands.  Her pulse was irregular.
She had a “Rhythm strip” in ER (Fig 1)
Atrial Fibrillation
82 year-old woman comes to the ER with new right arm weakness and inability to speak.  Symptoms occurred suddenly.  Her daughter says she had complained of an irregular heart beat, but was otherwise fine
• Multiple reentrant depolarization waves colliding in atria
• Results in variable conduction to ventricle
• Decremental conduction through AV node
• Ventricular rate may be slow or fast
• No effective contraction, so clots can form in atrium
• Common cause of “stroke” by embolization or low cardiac output
