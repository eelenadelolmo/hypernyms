Right posterior parietal lobe arteriovenous malformation measuring
2.1 x 1.5 x 1.7cm with no obvious deep drainage noted and no eloquent brain
parenchyma involved.  As an MRA was not obtained, a aneurysm cannot be
entirely excluded.
Arteriovenous Malformation
dural Arteriovenous fistula
History: 21y.o. male s/p resection of upper back melanoma with clear margins, work up for possible metastatic melanoma to the brain prior to selection for an NIH study for melanoma vaccine. No symptomatic complaints.  This young individual underwent a brain MRI with contrast to determine possible melanoma metastatic lesions to the brain.  An incidental arteriovenous malformation was discovered on imaging.
