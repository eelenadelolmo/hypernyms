Texto: 
Lungs clear.  Slightly tachycardic with otherwise normal rhythm.
Address source of anemia.
There is hypodensity of the left ventricular contents relative to the myocardium resulting in apparent density of the interventricular suptum.  The left ventricle measured 30 HU.  Additionally, the aortic wall is noted
ANEMIA
Anemia vs normal (ie: false positive)
26 year old male with recent blast injury with multiple injuries to the lower extremities presents with gradually decreasing cardiopulmonary status.
The findings of hypoattenuation of the left ventricle (HU 30), a dense appearance of the myocardium and an "aortic ring sign" a virtually diagnostic of severe anemia.  The inclusion of this finding in the radiology report may help alert the provider to a change in the patient's status and thus impact the patient's management and outcome.
