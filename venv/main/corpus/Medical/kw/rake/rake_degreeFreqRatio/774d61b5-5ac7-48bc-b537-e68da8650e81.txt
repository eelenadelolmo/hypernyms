-Vitals: BP122/60 HR150 RR50 SpO2 88-98 on room air
-General: Pink, lethargic baby, no apparent distress
-Head: Anterior fontanel open and flat
-Ears: Slightly rotated
-Mouth: No cleft
-Heart: RRR, 3/6 holosystolic murmur at left sternal border 
-Lungs: Clear bilaterally
-Abdomen: Soft, nontender
-Extremities: Bilateral club foot

CBC/CMP within normal limits
Treatment: Reimplantation of the hypoplastic right pulmonary artery to the main pulmonary artery and PDA ligation
Follow up: Within one month following surgery the right atrial pressure dropped to one half systolic pressure, suggesting the operation was successful at restoring normal blood flow.  As of 02/22/2013 patient is doing well.  He is 50th percentile for height and weight.  He has no signs of cyanosis or peripheral edema.  His EKG shows normal sinus rhythm, with evidence of right ventricular conduction delay but no gross T wave abnormalities.  Echocardiography shows no dilation or hypertrophy of any heart chambers.  His right pulmonary artery is still smaller than the left, however it appears to be growing well.
Aberrant vasculature noted in the thorax.  The pulmonary artery originates from the right ventricle and crosses behind the aorta toward the left.  At this level, the aorta gives off the right pulmonary artery.  A small VSD cannot be excluded.  The pulmonary artery is connected to the descending aorta by a prominent PDA.  The trachea and esophagus are unremarkable.  The lungs demonstrate no evidence of parenchymal consolidation, pleural effusions, or hilar adenopathy.  The patient is normal situs.
Anomalous origin of the right pulmonary artery from the ascending aorta
Truncus arteriosis, Tetralogy of Fallot
1 day old male born by spontaneous vaginal delivery with Apgars of 9 and 9 was discovered to be lethargic with decreased PO intake.  Patient was transferred to Dayton Children’s from an outside facility.  mIVF were started and patient was placed on HAL + IL 100cc/kg/day and 2 mg/kg/day protein.  Patient remained stable for further workup
