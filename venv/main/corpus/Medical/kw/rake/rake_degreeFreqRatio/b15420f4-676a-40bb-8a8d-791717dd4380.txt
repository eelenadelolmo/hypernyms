General:  NAD; exhibits features of trisomy 21
Heart:	2/6 systolic murmur heard best at the right 
sternal border.  
Anus:  Appears patent and normally positioned.
Resection with pull through surgery to maintain continence.  Follow-up is based on an as needed basis for symptoms of enterocolitis or constipation.
Image 1 – Supine view:  multiple loops of dilated bowel, no air in rectum
Image 2 – Prone view:  absence of air in rectum; dilated loops of bowel
Image 3 – Lateral view of contrast in the bowel reveals a transition zone at the splenic flexure
Image 4 – Frontal view of contrast in the bowel also reveals a transition zone at the splenic flexure.  Contrast was able to go around the meconium plug.  This image also shows the proximal colon wrapped around the distal colon and suggests a reverse intussusception

Hirshsprung’s disease
Meconium plug syndrome 
Meconium ileus
Colonic atresia
This is a term baby girl status post spontaneous vaginal delivery.  The pregnancy was complicated by a positive quad screen.  Apgar scores were 3, 5, and 7 at one minute, five minutes, and ten minutes respectively.  She was transferred to NICU one day after birth to rule out congenital heart disease.  She also failed to spontaneously pass meconium; rectal stimulation was needed.
One of the most common surgical emergencies in the newborn is for bowel obstruction.  When a newborn develops abdominal distention and fails to pass his first stool, distal bowel obstruction must be suspected.  There are several different etiologies for distal bowel obstruction, and amongst the list of differentials is Hirshsprung’s disease.

Those with Down’s syndrome have a higher incidence of complications following surgery.  They have a higher risk of enterocolitis and a risk of suffering adverse cardiovascular events.
