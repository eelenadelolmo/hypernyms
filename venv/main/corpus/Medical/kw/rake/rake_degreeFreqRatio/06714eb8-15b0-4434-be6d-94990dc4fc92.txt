Texto: 
Cardiac Echo demonstrated mild gradient of approximately 12mm Hg across the proximal aorta.
Maximum intensity projection sagittal MRI through the aortic arch demonstrates a focal narrowing of the aorta just distal to the left subclavian artery take-off. No other cardiac abnormalities were identified.
aortic coarctation
Coarctation of the Aorta
Pseudocoarctation
Hypertension
In a setting of a "kinked" appearance to the aorta and a minimal demonstratable gradient with an asymptomatic patient, the possibility of pseudocoarctation should be entertained.
