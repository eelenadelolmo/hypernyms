Non-contributory
Multiple pumonary nodules which show increased metabolic activity on PET.
Uterine Leiomyosarcom with pulmonary metastasis
Thromboemboli with organizing infarcts
Septic emboli
Wegener granulomatosis
Malignancy:
   Metastases(breast,renal,GI,Uterus,ovary,sarcoma),lymphoma,
   Multiple primary bronchgenic CA
Benign:
   Hamartoma,benign mets leimyoma AV malformation, Amyloidosis
History of large symptomatic uterine fibroids.Patient elected for uterine artery embolization (UAE) as treatment modality. 18 months after UAE develop SOB/cough.
Uterine Leiomysarcoma can arise independent of leiomyoma(fibroids)as well as occuring with sarcomatous transformation of preexisitng leiomyoma(reported between 1%-02% of pathology specimens from uteruses removed for symptomatic leiomyomas).
