Supraclavicular vascular mass with prominent superficial veins.
This patient was treated with a short course of propranolol with marked interval decrease in the size of the lesion.
Lobulated, intensely enhancing mass lesion with high flow intralesional vessels.
Capillary Hemangioma
• Capillary (Infantile) Hemangioma
• Venous Malformation
• Sarcoma (Rhabdomyosarcoma, Extraosseous Ewings, Undifferentiated Sarcoma)
• Plexiform Neurofibroma
• Arteriovenous Malformation
15 month old baby girl with enlarging right supraclavicular / shoulder mass.
Infantile hemangiomas are benign neoplasms of endothelial cells.  They are the most common childhood tumor, occurring in 12% of children.  They are more common in females, whites, premature infants, and twins.  

At birth these lesions can be small and inconspicuous, with 60% absent at birth.  The natural history is a two stage process of proliferation and regression.  The typical hemangioma will begin to involute by 10 months of age, with half of all lesions having resolved by 5 years.

Clinically, hemangiomas appear as erythematous or blanching macules, or appear as a small telangiectasia.  The clinical appearance depends upon the degree of dermal involvement and lesion depth.  Lesions involving the skin have a more characteristic strawberry appearance.  Deeper lesions demonstrate a blue appearance.  

Most hemangiomas are generally treated conservatively. Corticosteroids are the first line of treatment for problematic infantile capillary hemangiomas.  Other options include interferon alpha and vincristine.  Propranolol has also been observed to inhibit growth. While the mechanism of action is unclear, potential explanations include vasoconstriction; down-regulation of the RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway; and the triggering of apoptosis of capillary endothelial cells. 

Capillary hemangiomas can develop life threatening complications, such as consumptive coagulopathy, compression of vital structures, and bleeding secondary to fissure or ulcer formation.
