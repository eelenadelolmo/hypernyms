Plain film:  Lucent fracture line inferior to the anterior tibial spine

MRI:  T1 dark fracture line demonstrated in the coronal and sagittal plane inferior to the anterior tibial spine.  The fracture fragment demonstrates approximately 4mm superior displacement and slight rotation. The ACL is intact.
Tibial Spine Avulsion
9 yo girl in a "sledding accident" earlier today, presents with a painful, flexed, swollen knee. She is unable to bear weight.
