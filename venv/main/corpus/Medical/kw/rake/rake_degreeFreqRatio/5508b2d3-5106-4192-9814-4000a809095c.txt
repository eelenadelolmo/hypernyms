Noncontributory
Pending Biopsy/Resection
The MRI/MRA study showed no vascular pathology, but incidentally it was noted that there was a heterogeneous and mildly expanded clivus.

Whole body skeletal scintigraphy showed nonspecific increased uptake in the clivus region.

Repeat CT of the sinus was performed, revealing a “ground glass appearance”, containing a smaller circumscribed area, which has the appearance of a cystic lesion.  Overall the process appeared nonaggressive and was stable on 5 month follow-up CT.
Fibrous Dysplasia of the Clivus
•Chordoma*
•Chondrosarcoma*
•Plasmacystoma
•Lymphoma
•GCT*
•Cavernous hemangioma*
•Carcinomas (adenocystic or nasopharyngeal)
•Mets*
•Paget’s

* should have low T1, high T2 signal
41 year old female with increasing headaches and a family history of aneurysms. A head CT performed at another institution was reportedly unremarkable.  MRI/MR angiography of the Circle of Willis was performed at our institution to evaluate for possible aneurysm.
None
