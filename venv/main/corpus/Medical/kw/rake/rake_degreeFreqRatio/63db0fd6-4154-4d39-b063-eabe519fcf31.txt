Texto: 
Grouped Papules with very mild erythema.  No surface change.  Slightly raised with very minimal central indentation. No bleeding or discharge.
Treatment recommendations include a course of potent topical steroid, such as clobetasol or fluocinonide ointment for several weeks.
Biopsy would be reasonable, if available.  
Lichen planus has been associated with Hepatitis C so screening is appropriate.
Grouped Papules with very mild erythema.
Lichen planus
â€¢ Athropod Bite
â€¢ Eczema
â€¢ Granuloma Annulare
44 y.o. male with a past medical history of vitiligo. Developed a rash on the volar-palmar aspect of right wrist approximately 8 weeks ago. No known exposures.

Non-pruritic. Slightly raised with very minimal central indentation. No bleeding or discharge. Not course or scab-like. 

Non-responsive to hydrocortisone topical (1% or 2%). No new contact with pets/animals. No other Past Medical History. NKDA. Social History is significant for  dipping. Constitution symptoms: negative.
