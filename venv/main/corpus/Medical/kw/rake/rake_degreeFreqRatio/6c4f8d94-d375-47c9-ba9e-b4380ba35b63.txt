Supportive
Lesion in the left basal ganglia showing restricted diffusion (bright on DWI & dark on ADC) -  but without any mass effect.  This lesion enhances following contrast administration.
Basal ganglia infarction - enhancing
Primary tumor
Trauma
Infarction - subacute and reperfused
48 year old woman who developed left hemiparesis that gradually improved over 48 hours.  Initial CT was negative.
The patient was thought to have a brain tumor based on the initial MRI done at an outside hospital.  Four weeks later, this follow up  MRI study, and lack of symptom progression, confirmed the diagnosis of infarction - not neoplasm.
