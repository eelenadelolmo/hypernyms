Her pain is greater than her tenderness on exam.
Labs show metabolic acidosis.
Catheter directed thrombolytic therapy was contraindicated due to the patient's history of hemorrhagic stroke.
A surgical thrombectomy was performed.  However, the surgeon insisted that a conventional angiogram be performed.
Axial CT images with oral and intravenous contrast reveal a filling defect in the proximal superior mesenteric artery.  

MPR coronal CT image reveals the filling defect in the proximal SMA.

Digital subtraction angiographic image reveals an abrupt cut-off to the sub-selected, contrast filled proximal superior mesenteric artery.
Superior mesenteric artery thromboembolus
•Superior mesenteric artery thrombosis secondary to atrial fibrilation
•Superior mesenteric artery thrombosis secondary to hypercoaguable state
•Superior mesenteric artery occlusion secondary to atherosclerosis
83 yo Caucasian diabetic woman with atrial fibrillation and recent hemorrhagic stroke, not on anticoagulation, who recently developed severe abdominal pain
Editors note: 

MDCT angiography is just as diagnostic as conventional angiography for many vascular diseases.  However, at this time (September 10, 2006) many surgeons still request a confirmatory conventional angiogram prior to performing surgery.  

Such requests are understandable because radiological technological advancements are outpacing clinical experience.  It is hard to convince experienced surgeons that current MDCT technology is equivalent to conventional angiography because there are no prospective randomized trials to hold a high as proof of this reality.  

However, in a case of acute bowel ischemia secondary to embolism such as this, a radiologist should stand firm and insist that MDCT angiography is diagnostic.  Obtaining a conventional angiogram, especially after hours, can delay a definitive surgery for hours.

In addition, a conventional angiogram is an additional invasive procedure and will necessitate administering at least another 50 cc of potentially nephrotoxic contrast media.

Additional contrast use was especially dangerous in this patient because of the severe renal atrophy seen on the initial CT.
