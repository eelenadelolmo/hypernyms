Texto: 
Patient unable to cooperate with ROM exam secondary to pain.  Tenderness to palpation over the proximal right arm/shoulder.  No overt swelling or erythema. Neurovascularity intact distally.
Surgical curettage, with subsequent hardware fixation of the fracture.
Expansile lytic lesion centered on the proximal humeral metaphysis with subarticular extension.  It is geographic, and there is no significant marginal sclerosis.  No periosteal reaction.  The overlying cortex is thinned, and there is a pathologic fracture of the humeral neck.
Giant Cell Tumor
• Giant cell tumor
• Aneurysmal bone cyst - usually skeletally immature patient, should have no solid components on MRI 
• Intraosseus ganglion - usually older patient and has sclerotic margin, no solid components on MRI
• Chondroblastoma - usually skeletally immature patient, smaller and centered on epiphysis, usually has a sclerotic margin and often contains calcifications
• Chondromyxoid fibroma - more rare, typically metaphyseal location but without subarticular extension, usually sclerotic margin
23 y/o man with pain out of proportion to his apparently minor injury.
