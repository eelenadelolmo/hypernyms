Positive Murphy's sign per the ordering clinician
CBC within normal limits
AST . . . . . . . . . .  51 H (8-33) U/L
ALT . . . . . . . . . .  46 H (4-36) U/L
BUN . . . . . . . . . .  22 H (6-20) mg/dL
CMP otherwise within normal limits
1. Gallbladder is normal - no further follow up is needed
2. Individuals with Medullary Sponge Kidney have a normal lifespan with only a slight increased risk of hematuria, infection and stone formation.  No specific follow up is required, but increased attentiveness to clinical changes is recommended.
1. Gallbladder is unremarkable - no sonographic Murphy's sign

2. The right kidney is normal in size and contour with normal corticomedullary differentiation. The renal collecting system is decompressed. There are multiple hyperechoic foci within the medullary pyramids, the largest measuring approximately 1 cm in greatest diameter with posterior acoustic shadowing, consistent with multiple  medullary stones.

3. Comparison CT demonstrates medullary calcifications
Medullary Nephrocalcinosis - Likely Medullary Sponge Kidney
Nephrolithiasis
Medullary Nephrocalcinosis
-medullary sponge kidney
-hyperparathyroidism
-renal tubular acidosis
-other causes of hypercalcemia
51 year-old woman with a 4-5 month history of colicky abdominal pain.  RUQ ultrasound ordered to evaluate for gallstones.  Postive Murphy's sign per the ordering clinician.
