Extra-abdominal loops of bowel were placed in a silo device and eventually surgically returned to the patientâ€™s peritoneal cavity without complication of necrotizing enterocolitis.
Gastroschisis.  Frontal portable radiograph of the abdomen in this neonate shows an anterior abdominal wall defect just lateral to the level of the umbilical cord insertion.  To the left of the patient, herniated loops of small bowel are individually outlined by air.  The umbilicus was found to be normal in position.  Prominent tubular shaped opacity projecting in a superior to inferior manner over the mid-portion of the patientâ€™s lower abdomen and pelvis represents a silo into which the loops of small bowel were eventually placed.

Omphalocele (see factoid for explanation of how to differentiate these two diagnoses)
