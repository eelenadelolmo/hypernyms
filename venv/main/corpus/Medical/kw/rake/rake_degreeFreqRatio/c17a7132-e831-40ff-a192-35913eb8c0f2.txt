Treatment is usually conservative and includes rest, NSAIDs and modification of footwear.  Steroid injections are sometimes used.  Surgery rarely performed and consists of fascial release or excision of damaged fascia.
Plain radiographs demonstrate mild degenerative changes of the ankle and a small plantar calcaneal enthesophyte.

MRI shows marked thickening of the plantar fascia at its origin from the medial calcaneal tuberosity.  There is diffuse intermediate T1 signal and increased T2 signal within the fascia.
