Texto: 
Patient demonstrates an 18 week sized uterus.
Patient underwent uterine artery embolization and will follow up in 3 months for repeat imaging and reassessment of symptoms.
Imaging Findings:

MRI demonstrates an 18 cm uterus with 3 dominant fibroids in the anterior body measuring 4.2, 3.2, and 4.8 cm in diameter.  No ascites, ovarian lesions or adnexal masses were demonstrated.

Angiographic findings demonstrate a diffusely enlarged uterus with dominant vascularity on the right.  Post embolization angiogram demonstrates no significant uterine flow.
Uterine Artery Embolization for Uterine fibroids
N/A
48 year old female with history of menorrhagia and pelvic pain.
Uterine artery embolization is a minimally invasive treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids.  This method of treatment allows the patient to have a shorter course of recovery when compared to hysterectomy.  Patient was discharged home the following day without complications.
