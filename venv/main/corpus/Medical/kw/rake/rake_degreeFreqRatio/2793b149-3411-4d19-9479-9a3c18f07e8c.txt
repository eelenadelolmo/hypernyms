Physical examination disclosed normally reactive pupils and full range of extraocular movements. His disc margins were not sharp. His visual fields were grossly intact. The remainder of the cranial nerves were grossly intact. He had decreased perception of pin prick and touch on the right side.
The neoplasm was resected. The patient was doing well except for mild hemiparesis and occasional seizures eight years later.
Radiologic studies disclosed a large left frontal lobe tumor with focal calcifications.
Intracranial (osteo)chondroma
<li>astrocytoma
<li>oligodendroglioma
<li>metastasis
This 14 year old boy had a 1 1/2 year history of headaches that progressed to daily headaches. He also developed weakness in his right arm and leg and was having frequent falls. He was seen at a university hospital after developing focal seizures involving the right upper extremity.
