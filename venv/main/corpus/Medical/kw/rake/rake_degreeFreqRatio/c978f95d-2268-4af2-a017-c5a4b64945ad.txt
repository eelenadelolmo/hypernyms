Abdominal distension, elevated circulating estrogens
•	Surgical resection as possible- many lesions will be surgically unresectable or inaccessible such as at the mesenteric root 
•	Surgical v. chemical castration (GNRH analogues)
•	Aromatase inhibitors (Anastrozole)
•	Goal- symptomatic improvement
•	Metastatic degeneration to sarcoma- only 2-3 case reports in literature
Sagittal T-2 weighted and axial T-2 weighted with fat suppression MR images of the pelvis demonstrate multiple subserosal and intramural uterine fibroids with too numerous to count intraperitoneal masses of similar homogenous hypointensity
Disseminated Peritoneal Leiomyomatosis
Disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis
Metastatic peritoneal leiomyomatosis
Leiomyosarcoma
Peritoneal carcinomatosis from ovarian or other source.
40 year old woman with a fibroid uterus, abdominal fullness and urinary frequency.
