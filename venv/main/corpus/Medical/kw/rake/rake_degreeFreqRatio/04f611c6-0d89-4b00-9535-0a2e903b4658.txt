Well developed for age with bulging of the soft tissues bilaterally along the margins of the parietal bones
No intervention needed
Skull radiographs demonstrate bilateral smooth bulging of the soft tissues of the scalp along the parietal margins.  Note that the swelling does not cross suture lines.  No fracture is seen.

Ultrasound demostrated a hypoechoic crescentic fluid collection along the margin of the parietal periosteum bilaterally.
Cephalohematoma
Cephalohematoma
Caput Succedaneum
2 week old male with abnormal head contour, increased head circumference after birth and history of uncomplicated delivery. Request to evaluate for signs of intracranial pressure and rule out hydrocephalus.
