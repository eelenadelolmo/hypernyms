Swelling of patellar tendons and high riding patella bilaterally.
PT, surgery
Plain lateral x-rays of bilateral knees showed patella alta, a high riding patella. Joint effusion was noted. On MRI, disrupted patellar tendons were noted bilaterally.
Disruption and tears of the patella tendons bilaterally.
• Trauma due to extreme combat conditions (body armor, heat, stress). 
• Systemic lupus erythematosus 
• Rheumatoid arthritis
• Steroid use/ abuse
This 42 y/o active duty man jumped from his vehicle and felt a pop.  He then tried to hop on the other leg to the aid station and felt a pop in the good leg.  The rest is history with him lying in the dirt unable to walk, asking for help, crawling on his belly, etc.
This unusual case may represent how the "fog of war" may increase incidence of otherwise systemic based injuries.
