General: The patient is a white male. He is 170.2cm tall and weighs about 98.7 kg (BMI 34.1). Blood pressure on the left arm in the seated position is 129/64. Appears stated age. He is well appearing and in no acute distress.
HEENT : Normocephalic, non traumatic. Pupils were equal and reactive to light. 
Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, Normal S1 and S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Right sided scars visible from healed VATS. Median sternotomy incision is well healed. 
Pulmonary : Pattern unlabored, breath sounds are clear and equal bilaterally, no distress. No rales, no rhonchi, no wheezez.
Abdomen: Non-distended
Extremities: No cyanosis, no clubbing, no edema, no coolness and no deformities. 

Musculoskeletal: 5+ muslce strength in all extremities, gait and tone are normal.
This patient was initially treated with right thoracotomy, which yielded 2L of fluid. This procedure significantly improved his shortness of breath. 
He then underwent a right VATS pleurectomy and was then referred to outpatient an outpatient medical oncologist who is currently managing his treatment.
He currently on chemotherapy under supervision of a medical oncologist, and reports that he is doing well.
Images 1 and 2 represent a pre-operative PET-CT. The patient was given IV 18F-FDG followed by low-dose, non contrast CT from the skull vertex to the mid-thigh. This CT was obtained for attenuation correction and anatomic orientation with axial reconstruction. PET followed, encompassing the same regions. The chest was found to show mild to moderate abnormal FDG uptake within the right-sided pleural effusion/thickening.  There was a small internal decrease in size. There was no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy. There is no air-space disease or suspicious lung nodule. These findings are consistent with low-grade metabolically active malignant epithelioid neoplasm consistent with mesothelioma of the right-sided pleura. 

Image 3 represents erect PA and lateral chest images following VATS pleurectomy. These films demonstrate post-sternotomy midline wires and clips. Of note there is mild to moderate cardiomegaly and chronic right basolateral pleural thickening of the inferior right minor fissure. A Mediport-type catheter is visualized overlying the superior right hemithorax with its distal extent projecting over the course of the right jugular vein. There is also minor bronchitis interstitial features at the lung bases. There is no acute pathology noted, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax or definitive infiltrates.

Image 4 represents a follow up study approximately 2 weeks after Image 3 was obtained. There was evidence of COPD. It was noted that there was pleural-parenchymal scarring of the right lung base. The same medial sternotomy changes were noted, as was the Mediport placement and cardiomegaly. At this point there was no active pulmonary disease noted. 

Images 5, 6, and 7 represent post-operative PET-CT following right-sided VATS pleurectomy. The same protocol was followed as for the PET-CT shown in images 1 and 2. There was found to be minimal abnormal FDG uptake within the right-sided pleura. There was no axillary, supraclavicular, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy. The image has the overall appearance of postsurgical inflammatory changes, although residual low-grade metabolically active metastasis cannot be excluded.
Malignant mesothelioma, epithelioid type
Asbestosis
Malignant Mesothelioma
This patient is a 77 year old male who presented to his primary care physician as part of a pre-operative work-up for cataract surgery. On CXR it was noted that the patient has a pleural effusion. The patient did note that he had increasing shortness of breath, but did not think to address this issue prior to his pre-op clearance.

Allergies: Adhesive Tape (rash)

Transfustions: Mr. B has 2 blood transfusions as a result of rectal bleeding from GI tumors.

Social: 34 pack year smoking histroy (2 ppd for 17 years), quit smoking in 1970. History of alcohol abuse, sober since 2012 when he underwent treatment for etOH withdrawal. He denies any illicit and/or IV drug abuse. Mr. B has 3 children. He lives in an apartment on his house, which his daughter occupies. He worked as at chemical plant for 40 years. He recalls this plant is adjacent to another chemical plant which used asbestos as part of its plastics manufacturing process.
This patient is a 77 year old white male. He worked in a factory adject to a chemical plant, which used asbestos in the manufacturing of plastic products. He states that he remembers hearing that during the day, the plant would vacuum excess asbestos from the factory floor to the roof of the building and then vent the asbestos out the stacks of the factory at night. In fact, the patient's grown son, now in his fifties, recalls there often being a thin coating of ?dust? on park benches in the morning following the venting from the plant. 

The patient states that he worked in a plant approximately 600 feet from the asbestos-using facility, and states that his factory was under negative pressure, resulting in outside asbestos-containing air to be ?sucked into? his factory. He began work in the 1960s and worked at the same plant for 41 years until his retirement in 2003. He also lived approximately 1 mile from both plants, and states that his home was directly downwind from the factories. Unfortunately, this patient reported that a former coworker died of complications from mesothelioma. 

This patient's mesothelioma was discovered incidentally as part of pre-operative clearance for a propsed opthalmologic surgery. As part of his pre-operative work-up a chest Xray was ordered, which revealed a large plueral effusion. He recalls that at the time of discovery he did have shortness of breath with minimal exersion, stating that he would become short of breath ?just by talking?. 

This patient's case is typical of malignant pleural mesothelioma. This disease typically affects patients who are 60 years and older. Often, these patients present decades after an exposure to asbestos and have gradual, worsening, nonspecific pulmonary symptoms including but not limited to: chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hoarseness, or dysphagia.

Physical findings at the time of diagnosis generally are related to a pleural effusion, which is often present. Physical exam findings may include unilateral dullness to percussion at the lung base, decreased air movement on side of involvement, or asymmetric chest wall expansion during respiration (2-6).
The primary risk factor for mesothelioma is asbestos exposure. The fibers of asbestos, a naturally occuring mineral, are strong and resistant to heat, and have been used in the production of insulation, brakes, shingles, flooring and many other products. If asbestos is broken up, and the dust is inhaled or swallowed, the fibers will settle in the lungs, leading to irritation, which can then progress to mesothelioma. The exact mechanism of this malignant transformation is poorly understood. The development of mesothelioma following asbestos exposure may be a  20 - 40 year process. Of note, most people with years of asbestos exposure never develop mesothelioma, while some people, with only minimal exposure, develop the disease. Given this variation, a predisposition to cancer likely plays a role in disease progression. Additional risk factors include, living with someone working with asbestos (as they may carry the fibers home on their clothing and skin), as well as family history of mesothelioma (7- 9).

In terms of imaging, computed tomography (CT) is often pursued given limited sensitivity and specificity with CXR. Findings include unilateral pleural abnormalities with a large unilateral pleural effusion. There may be a plural mass or "rind", or even a diffuse pleural thickening in the absence of pleural effusion. There can be ipsilateral mediastinal shift due to encasement of the lung by a thick "rind"of tumor and relative ipsilateral lung volume loss. When positron emission tomography (PET) is used in conjunction with CT,  increased uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is observed.

For the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma, clinical suspicion may arise with respiratory symptoms, pleural thickening and/or effusion on chest imaging, and a history of asbestos exposure. However, ultimately, a biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
Once diagnosed, an integrated positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET-CT) is the initial staging assessment.
When diagnosed at an early stage, surgeons may remove the mesothelioma, and in some cases, this may be curative. Other therapies include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. There are ongoing clinical trials investigating targeted biological and gene therapy.
Overall, however, the prognosis is poor. The survival is on the spectrum of 9 to 17 months after diagnosis and few patients are cured (12).
