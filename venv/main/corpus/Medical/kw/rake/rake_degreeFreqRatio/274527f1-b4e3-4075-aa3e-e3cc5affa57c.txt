His vital signs are stable, and physical exam and labwork are unremarkable.
The patient underwent pyloromyotomy.  He experienced emesis of decreasing frequency for the next two to three days, which is not uncommon.  Two weeks later, the patient is doing well.
Ultrasound of the pylorus.  The transverse images show a hypoechoic circle with a hyperechoic center.  The thickness of the hypoechoic wall is 2.5 mm.  The longitudinal images show the pyloric channel to be 14 mm long.  Despite imaging for approximately 20 minutes, the channel did not open during examination, and the water within the stomach did not cross the pylorus.
hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, confirmed intraoperatively
Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis
Pylorospasm
Obstruction from extrinsic mass
Malrotation
Annular pancreas
The patient is a 5-week old male who presents with 24 hours of non-bilious vomiting.
