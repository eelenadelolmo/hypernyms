Texto: 
Unenhanced CT scout image and axial CT images demonstrate two calcifications adjacent to the cecum, within soft tissue likely representing the appendix, consistent with appendicoliths.   The appendix, however, is not enlarged, and there is no evidence of periappendiceal inflammation.  No calcifications within the kidneys, ureters or bladder were noted.
Appendicolith without appendicitis
47 year-old male with a history of chronic renal stones, with left-sided pain, and calcification noted on plain films over the right mid to lower quadrant.
This case is submitted as an example of an appendicolith without appendicitis.
