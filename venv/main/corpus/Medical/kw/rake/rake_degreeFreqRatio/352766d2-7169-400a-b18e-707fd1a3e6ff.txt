Texto: 
Decreased range of motion of right hip secondary to pain.

Labs normal.
Hip replacement is the best treatment, however this patient was a poor surgical candidate and was treated with oral pain meds and facet blocks.
X-ray: Serpntine sclerotic densities in the both femoral heads

Nuclear Scan: Focal areas of photopenia in the femoral heads with surrounding mild-to-moderate increased uptake in the subcapital areas and acetabuli. 

MRI: Serpentine areas of hypointensity seen in the bilateral femoral heads on T2 images.  Increased T2 signal seen in the remaining marrow and femoral necks.
Bilateral avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral heads
AVN (Avascular necrosis)
Fracture secondary to fall
Osteoarthritis
Inability to bear weight on right hip with constant, severe, non-radiating pain of abrupt onset.  Patient fell yesterday.
Male to female ratio for AVN is 8 to 1. Etiologies are numerous, however, in non-taumatic cases the etiology is poorly understood.  Glucocorticoid steroid use and excessive alcohol intake are reported to account for more than 90 percent of cases.

One possible mechanism of steroid-induced osteonecrosis involves alterations in circulating lipids with resultant microemboli in the arteries supplying bone. A newer theory proposes that steroids induce changes in venous endothelial cells, leading to stasis, increased intraosseous pressure, and eventual necrosis. Excessive alcohol use and the development of osteonecrosis have been linked for decades; fat emboli, venous stasis, and increased cortisol levels have all been implicated as etiologic factors.  

Patients with SLE who have taken glucocorticoids are at greatest risk, although occasional cases have been noted in the absence of steroid therapy.  In addition to their role in patients with SLE, antiphospholipid antibodies may be associated with an increased risk of osteonecrosis in other individuals. Fracture or dislocation may cause damage to the extraosseous blood vessels supplying the affected region. 

Osteonecrosis is common in patients with homozygous sickle cell disease. Approximately 50 percent of affected patients develop osteonecrosis by the age of 35.  Gaucher Disease results in the accumulation of cerebroside-filled cells within the bone marrow. This process may lead to compression of the vasculature and subsequent osteonecrosis.   Osteonecrosis can occur following renal transplantation, but usually multifocal. Ther is increased prevalence with thrombophillic disorders such as the factor V Leiden mutation.  HIV may confer an increased risk of developing osteonecrosis of the femoral head as well as individuals undergoing radiation therapy.  

There are two types of osteonecrosis limited to children: idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (Legg-Calv?-Perthes disease); and osteonecrosis occurring in children, usually adolescents, with a slipped capital femoral epiphysis.
