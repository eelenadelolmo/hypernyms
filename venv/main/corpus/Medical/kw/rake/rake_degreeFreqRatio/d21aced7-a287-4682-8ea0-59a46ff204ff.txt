Seizures and clinical findings of severe heart failure.
Repeat cerebral MRI after successful therapy for Congestive heart failure revealed complete resolution of the intracranial venous congestion
• Dilated Sagittal Sinus, Right transverse sinus and petrosal veins.
• Cardiomegaly and pulmonary infiltrates noted Chest Film
• Multiple parenchymal cerebral hemorrhages
• Negative MRA and MRV (not shown)
Intracranial Venous Sinus Congestion from  (congestive) cardiomyopathy
• Vein of Galen Aneurysm
• AVM
• Dural AV Fistula
• Central Venous Hypertension
New born girl with low APGAR scores, biventricular heart failure and multifocal cerebral hemorrhages.  Transferred to tertiary hospital NICU from outside hospital shortly after birth.
The reason for marked enlargement of the intracranial veins was not evident until the history of biventricular heart failure was established.  Presumably the elevated right heart pressure was transmitted directly to the intracranial veins via the jugular veins.  These findings resolved with the successful medical treatment of the heart failure.
