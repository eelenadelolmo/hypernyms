Texto: 
Delayed whole body scintiscans reveal increased uptake in a predominantly vertical linear pattern in the region of the symphysis pubis, bilaterally, extending into the medial aspects of the inferior and superior pubic rami; and in a vertically oriented fusiform pattern in the sacrum, bilaterally.  

Foci of increased uptake are also noted in the right lateral femoral condyle and in the left 11th rib at the costochondral junction.

Uptake most consistent with osteoarthritis is noted in the bilateral hips, bilateral first carpometacarpal joint regions, the left sternoclavicular junction, the ankles (right >left), and in the region of the left great toe.

Probable hyperostosis of the skull is also noted.
Pelvic insufficiency fractures
DDx for primary teaching point of case-pelvic osseous uptake: insufficiency versus pathologic fractures of the pubic rami and sacrum
80 yo woman with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the colon, and osteoporosis, presenting for a skeletal survey to evaluate for metastatic disease.  No known history of metastatic disease or trauma.
CT scan (not shown) revealed no evidence of metastatic disease in the pelvis or thorax, and provided confirmation of the diagnosis of insufficiency fractures in the pelvis in the regions noted above.
