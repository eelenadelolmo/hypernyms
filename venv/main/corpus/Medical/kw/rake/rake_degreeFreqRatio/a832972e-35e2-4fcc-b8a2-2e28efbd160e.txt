Exam:  Tenderness to palpation overlying L adnexal region.  Pelvic exam revealed a small amount of blood in the vaginal vault.

Labs:  betaHCG--1110 mIU/ml; WBC count and Hgb/Hct are normal
A Left salpingectomy was performed and submitted to pathology which confirmed the diagnosis of tubal ectopic pregnancy with associated hemorrhage.  The patient is doing well post-operatively.
A dilated 1cm tubular structure, predominantly hyperechoic, with some central hypoechoic foci is seen anterior to an unremarkable appearing L ovary.  A gestational sac is not seen in or around the tubular structure or in the left adnexa.
No gestational sac is seen on the single image of the uterus.
A moderate amount of free fluid is noted in the pelvis with increased echotexture/debris within the dependent regions of the fluid collection
Hematosalpinx due to tubal ectopic pregnancy
--Hematosalpinx from tubal ectopic pregnancy
--Pyosalpinx (PID)
--Primary tubal carcinoma vs. metastatic dz
--Fallopian tube torsion
--Thrombosed ovarian vessel
--Left-sided appendicitis (very rare)
21 y/o female reports to the ER with 24 hour history of worsening left sided pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding.
