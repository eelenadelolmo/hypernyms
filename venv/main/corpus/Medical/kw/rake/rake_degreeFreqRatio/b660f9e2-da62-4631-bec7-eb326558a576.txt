Surgical resection and post operative radiation planned.
In the spinal canal, from approximately the mid body of T11 through the sacrum, is a large expansile intradural mass which is isointense to the cord on T1, hyperintense to the cord on T2 and avidly enhances with gadolinium albeit eterogeneously.  Marked scalloping of the posterior vertebral bodies is noted most marked in the sacrum.  

	This mass in the lumbar region extends into the neural foramina at all levels and expands the neural foramina at the lower segments with extension out of the right neural foramina at L5-S1. 
	At the level of L4, there is a focal T2 bright lesion which may represent a small fatty element or small region of hemorrhage.
Myxopapillary ependymoma.
