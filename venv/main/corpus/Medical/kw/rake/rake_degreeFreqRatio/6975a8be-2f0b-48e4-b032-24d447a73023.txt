Mass was resected
There is a 2.79 x 2.02 x 1.9 cm mass in the right frontal lobe.  It is well circumscribed with heterogeneous signal characteristics.  There is a cystic component medially with calcifications laterally.  There is no mass effect or surrounding edema.  On T2 there is hyperintense  signal surrounding the mass superiorly which probably represents malacic change.
Meningioangiomatosis
â€¢ Ganglioglioma
â€¢ Oligodendroglioma
â€¢ Mixed glioma (Oligo-Astrocytoma)
â€¢ Astrocytoma
â€¢ Pleomorphic-Xanthoastrocytoma
A 23 yr corpsman who had a witnessed syncopal episode, in front of the surgeon she was working with.  There is a history of headaches for the last 6 months and previous syncopal episodes.
