Texto: 
On exam, the patient had a large knee effusion, a palpable lump between the inferior pole of the patella and the tibial tubercle, and inability to actively extend his knee.
The patient underwent surgical reconstruction, cast immobilization, and physical therapy.
Plain film radiographs of the knee demonstrate patella alta (abnormally high position of the patella) and a small osseous fragment anterior to the joint space, consistent with an avulsion fracture off of the tibial tubercle. There is associated soft tissue swelling and joint effusion.
Rupture of the patellar tendon with associated tibial tubercle avulsion fracture.
Patellar tendon rupture
Tibial tuberosity avulsion
Patient felt a snap in his left knee when landing from a jump shot during a basketball game.
