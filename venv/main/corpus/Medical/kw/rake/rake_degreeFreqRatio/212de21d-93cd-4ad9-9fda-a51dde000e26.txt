Blood-tinged sputum. Chest pain from coughing. Left-sided wheezing. Diminished breath sounds on right.
Treatment: Pneumonectomy or lobectomy is curative.  Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients may not require treatment. 

Follow-up: Patients undergoing lung resection will require close short-term follow-up with the surgeon and pulmonologist. Routine follow-up care would be recommended for long-term post-operative care as well as for non-surgical patients.
CHEST XRAY: Significantly asymmetric lungs with small volume right lung showing evidence of interstitial edema and small central pulmonary vessels with a large volume relatively hyperlucent left lung.

CT WITH CONTRAST: Small right lung with a pattern of chronic lung disease diffusely. Innumerable small, thin walled air-filled cystic structures are seen along the pleural surfaces throughout the right lung with septal thickening. The right pulmonary artery diameter is considerably smaller (11 mm) compared with the left (22 mm). No pulmonary veins are demonstrated extending to the left atrium. Multiple small collateral vessels are demonstrated throughout the mediastinum. The azygous vein is enlarged and tortuous. The left upper lobe and left lower lobe pulmonary veins drain normally into the left atrium. The heart and mediastinum are shifted to the right.
Congenital Unilateral Pulmonary Vein Atresia (Right)
1. Vasculitis/vascular malformations
2. Tuberculosis or other infection
3. Trauma
4. Bleeding disorder or pulmonary embolus
5. Cystic Fibrosis
16 y.o. boy with hemoptysis for one day. Hx of asthma and multiple episodes of pneumonia in the past.

Current Medications: None taken, but he has been prescribed an inhaler, antihistamines, and corticosteroids for asthma symptoms.
Unilateral pulmonary vein atresia is an extremely rare congenital malformation which may occur in either lung, with no left or right sided predominance (Cullen). It is thought to be caused by embryological failure of incorporation of the cardinal and vitelline veins into the normal left atrial pulmonary vein confluence (Cullen). Patients usually present with hemoptysis, asthma with exercise intolerance, and/or recurrent pneumonia within the first three years of life (Changela). It is often, however, later in childhood or even adulthood (after multiple diagnostic modalities are exhausted) when the final diagnosis is made (Pourmoghadam).
 
The initial chest radiograph includes findings of a unilateral small lung with severe interstitial edema. CT with contrast will confirm these x-ray findings along with absence of the affected lung’s normal pulmonary venous entrance into the left atrium. A unilateral underdeveloped pulmonary artery to the smaller lung may also be present due to preferential contralateral perfusion (Heyneman). This is in contrast to dilated bilateral pulmonary arteries with total anomalous pulmonary venous return (Changela). Congenital heart defects such as pulmonary artery hypertension are found in about 50% of patients (Heyneman). The unaffected lung is usually hyperexpanded and hyperlucent (Dillman), which may be compensatory. 

Lung histology on the side of pulmonary vein atresia reveals dilated lymphatics with chronic fibrotic changes and thickened peribronchial tissue (Samanek, Kingston). These findings, along with peripheral alveolar destruction and subpleural paraseptal emphysema, were present in our patient. Hemoptysis is likely attributed to systemic collateral supply involving the affected lung (Heyneman). Recurrent infection may be due to reduced unilateral blood supply and pulmonary stasis. 

MRI may be helpful for anatomic detail (Heyneman), although cardiac catheterization with wedge pressure measurement is recommended for definitive diagnosis (Pourmoghadam). Treatment options include conservative management (for the least symptomatic patients) or lobectomy/pneumonectomy (Daltro, Changela). Coil embolization of systemic collaterals has also been postulated (Daltro), although this may be impractical if a large number of small collateral vessels are present. Without appropriate treatment for symptomatic individuals, mortality is estimated at approximately 40% (Pourmoghadam).  The diagnosis of pulmonary vein atresia should be considered when a patient presents with hemoptysis, recurrent respiratory infections, and radiographic evidence of unilateral low lung volume (Cullen).
