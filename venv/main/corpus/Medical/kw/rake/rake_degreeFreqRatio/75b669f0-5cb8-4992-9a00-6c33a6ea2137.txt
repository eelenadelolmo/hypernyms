Texto: 
No ankle instability on exam. Temporary but complete pain relief after a Lidocaine injection in the ankle joint.
Diagnostic arthroscopy with debridement of the osteochondral injury.
Plain Film:  Subcortical lucency along the lateral talar dome.

MRI:  9 mm x 1.6 cm osteochondral injury (OCD of the talus) in the lateral talar dome with subjacent bone marrow edema, but no evidence of a loose fragment or significant flattening or collapse of the talar dome.
Osteochondral defect/injury of the talar dome.
Osteochondral defect/injury (OCD of the talar dome)
Chronic bilateral ankle pain with history of multiple sprains and feeling of instability.  Right ankle pain with running.
Osteochondral injuries of the talus may occur after an acute traumatic injury. The may be radiographically occult initially, but the plain films should be carefully scrutinized to detect fractures or small areas of lucency along the talar dome. If symptoms of ankle pain persist despite negative x-rays, an MRI should be considered to detect an osteochondral injury. It is important to recognize this injury, because if the patient continues to place stresses on the talus due to continued weightbearing/running, the injury may not heal properly, and could result in permanent cartilage loss, partial collapse of the talar dome and eventually result in chronic degenerative changes of the ankle. Depending on its severity, initial treatment is conservative with splinting or casting and limitations on weightbearing. If the injury is severe, or if the symptoms do not improve, arthroscopy with treatment of the osteochondral injury including debridement and or chondral fracturing or drilling techniques are often attempted.
