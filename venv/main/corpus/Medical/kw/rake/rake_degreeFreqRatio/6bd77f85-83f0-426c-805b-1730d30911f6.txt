The patient is scheduled for surgical resection with anticipated chemotherapy.
The lumbar spine demonstrated a focus of sclerosis within the L4 and L5 vertebral bodies with corresponding metabolic activity noted on bone scan.
The CT demonstrated abnormally thickened mucosa within the rectum as well as lymphadenopathy within the pelvis and inflamatory changes in the adjacent fat.
Colon Cancer
Neoplastic etiology
Infection with osteomyelitis witin the vertebral bodies.
56 year old female presents with a two month history of back pain and rectal bleeding.
