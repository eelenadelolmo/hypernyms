There is a lobulated mass at the palmar aspect of the left index finger. The mass measures 1.2 cm long x 6 mm in dorsal-palmar plane x 1.4 cm in greatest width. The mass shows intermediate T1, heterogeneous but predominantly low T2 signal and heterogeneous enhancement on the T1 postgadolinium sequences. No bone erosion.
