Texto: 
No focal point tenderness, no rebound or guarding.
As long as there is no associated volvulus, no surgery is immediatly indicated.  A prophylactic Ladds procedure can be done to prevent volvulus in the future.
Abdominal radiograph: Initial upright AP view of the abdomen demonstrates no dilated bowel, air-fluid levels and no free intraperitoneal air.   But there is stool filled large bowel loops that are seen only in the left hemi-abdomen.  There is a relative paucity of bowel in the right abdomen. 

CT: Abdominal CT scan shows non dilated, contrast filled loops of small bowel in the right half of the abdomen and contrast-stooled filled large bowel in the left half of the abdomen.  

KUB after UGI barium study: The post UGI abdomen again shows contrast filled loops of small bowel in the right half of the abdomen and contrast-stooled filled large bowel in the left half of the abdomen. Real time examination showed (images were unavailable for digitization) the duodenal-jejunal junction to the right of the spine and inferior to the duodenal bulb.
Midgut malrotation
None.
4 year old female presents to the emergency room with diffuse abdominal pain.
The patient came to the Emergency room at around 5:00 pm, and the initial plain radiograph was done at 5:45 pm.  That study suggested the diagnosis.  Because the patient was not obstructed by plain film and did not have a surgical abdomen, a CT was done to further evaluate a cause for the patinets pain.  The findings on CT were fairly convincing but to fully diagnose malrotation, UGI study was indicated.  Two days later, an UGI study was done as an outpatient.
