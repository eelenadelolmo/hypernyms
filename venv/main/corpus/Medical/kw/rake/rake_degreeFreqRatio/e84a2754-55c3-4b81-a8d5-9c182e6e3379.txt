Decreased sulci and gyri, with smooth appearing gyri, and prominence of the cerebrospinal fluid containing spaces; absence of evidence of myelination within the motor strip; smaller than normal corpus callosum, medulla, pons, mid brain, cerebellar peduncles and pyramids; prominent posterior cerebrospinal fluid collection which communicates with the fourth ventricle; low lying tentorium and torcular Herophili.

22 month old male with significant mental and neurological delay.
This is an additional example of lissencephaly (“smooth brain”), a form of abnormal neuronal migration, as mentioned in the factoid, which produces a brain with few, or even without, gyri, diffusely.  This case demonstates reduced gyri, diffusely, consistent with lissencephaly, but significantly milder than what may be seen with “complete lisencephaly,” (complete absence of gyri or sulci).  If the condition were to affect only a portion of the brain, it would be referred to as “pachygyria,” also sometimes called “incomplete lissencephaly.”  This case also demonstrates a dysgenic corpus callosum, a frequent finding in lissencephaly.  In addition, the prominent posterior fluid collection communicating with the fourth ventricle and low lying tentorium are consistent with a mild Dandy-Walker variant.
