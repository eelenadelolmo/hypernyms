Right Wrist: normal appearance without erythema, swelling or ecchymosis. No tenderness on palpation of carpal bones, radius, ulna and digits. ROM intact in flexion, extension, and radial and ulnar deviation. Strength 5/5 in flexion, extension, radial and ulnar deviation. Pain elicited with ulnar deviation and use of 5th digit against resistant, radiating to distal aspect of lateral ulna. No pain with wrist external and internal rotation against resistance. Fingers, thumb, lumbrical and interosseous muscles 5/5 with full ROM.
The patient was treated conservatively with avoidance of triggers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as needed and pending MRI to evaluate for underlying triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) damage from initial injury.
Findings: Normal bone mineralization and alignment is present without acute fracture or dislocation. Well-corticated ossific density at the ulnar styloid may represent an accessory os triangulare. Lucencies within the lunate may represent intraosseous ganglion.  No destructive osseous lesions are seen. There is no focal soft tissue swelling.

A.	Ulna styloid fracture
B.	Triquetrum avulsion fracture
C.	Lunula
D.	Ulna styloid ossicle
E.	Os triangulare
40 yo right handed male pilot presents with 6 month history of right wrist pain radiating to the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon. The pain is aggravated with ulnar deviation against resistance and use of 5th digit. Reported mechanism of injury (MOI) occurred 6 months ago when he was lifting heavy objects with wrist in ulnar deviation, external rotation and hyperextension with subsequent instantaneous wrist internal rotation, flexion and radial deviation to stabilize carrying heavy object with immediate pain and swelling at the time. He was initially seen and treated with rest, ice, compression and wearing wrist splint with gradual improvement to normal activities. 3 weeks ago he injured his left wrist due to falling on outstretched hand while running, and now presenting with right wrist pain again that he attributes to overuse injury due to compensation.
Os triangulare is an accessory ossicle located between the ulna styloid, lunate and triquetrum. It can be present unilaterally or bilaterally and does not cause clinical symptoms. Its main importance in radiology is in differentiating it from a fractures. This patient’s case gave a clinical presentation of a potential avulsion fracture at the triquetrum or ulnar styloid fracture given the MOI and on oblique view, there is a deformity of the triquetrum that may represent a well healed avulsion fracture. While radiologists have little difficulties differentiating accessory ossicles from fractures, it may pose a challenge to primary care providers. This case is a good review of reading techniques. The accessory ossicle shown is of uniform shape with a well-defined and smooth osteum, and on lateral view, the ossicle sits in the region between the ulna and the triquetrum which differentiates it from an avulsion fracture at the triquetrum which typically lies next to the triquetrum  with periosteal disruption at site of avulsion (until bone remodeling occurs after nonunion healing). See table 1 for summary of conditions and distinguishing features.
