Left lower extremity weakness noted.
The patient underwent surgical resection, XRT, and chemotherapy.  He is doing well 10 months after surgery.  His 10 month follow up MRI exam is included at the end of the images provided.
Large cystic/necrotic mass which enhances following administration of gadolinium in the right frontal lobe.  A subfalcine herniation is evident, with mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.  Vasogenic edema surrounds the mass.
Glioblastoma multiforme
Glioblastoma multiforme
Metastatic disease
Abscess
56 year old man presented with headaches and left lower extremity weakness for two weeks.
This lesion has an appearance consistent with GBM. Spectroscopy is consistent with a tumor, showing an elevated choline level (indicating increased cellular turnover), an elevated choline/creatine ratio, and a relative decline in the N-acetyl -L-aspartate peak.  This patient is doing well at the 10 month point, an uncommonly positive response to treatment.
