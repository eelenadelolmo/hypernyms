Texto: 
Vitals normal except for PO2 73%
HR- regular, no murmurs
Lungs- Clear bilaterally, no bruits, no wheezes
Skin- several small spider like lesions on upper back, perioral cyanosis, clubbing of fingers.

Labs: Hemoglobin/hematocrit= 17.8/53
The patient was admitted for observation and further workup of possible genetic disease. A CT of the entire abdomen was obtained which did not show any other areas of AVM's.  He also had a CT scan of the head which showed a small enhancing lesion possibly consistent with an intracranial AVM.  Genetics was consulted and it was determined that the pulmonary AVM's were likely congenital and associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.  He was evaluated by interventional radiology and plans were made for embolization of the AVM's in the near future.
CXR shows opacities present in both lungs. Several abnormal vasculature collections with dilated arterial supply and venous drainage.  One in the right lung and three in the left lung of varying sizes.

13 year old male presenting for routine visit noted to have oxygen saturation of 73%. The mother states his fingernails have always been bluish.  He has had nosebleeds 2-3 times a month since age 2.  Denies difficulty breathing or other respiratory symptoms.

Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia also known as Rendu-Osler-Weber Syndome is an autosomal dominant disorder that is often associated with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. HHT is a rare disorder that was formerly thought to only be associated with benign manifestations.  It is now recognized however that there may be more severe complications of the disease.  Some of the signs and symptoms include:

-Epistaxis
-Hemoptysis
-Dyspnea
-Clubbing of digits
-Mucocutaneous telangiectasias
-Gastrointestinal bleeding
-Bruits/murmurs
-High output CHF

The diagnosis of HHT requires certain criteria be met.  The criteria are as follows:

-Recurrent episodes of spontaneous epistaxis
-Mucocutaneous telangiectasias
-Visceral AVM's
-First degree relative affected in autosomal dominant interitance pattern

Meeting 3 or more criteria is sufficient for a definite diagnosis of HHT.  Meeting 2 out of 4 is inconclusive and leads to the designation of a possible diagnosis.  If less than 2 out of 4 criteria are met then the diagnosis is unlikely.  For this patient, he definitely has recurrent episodes of epistaxis by history.  The CT findings of pulmonary AVM's satisfies the visceral AVM criteria.  While no mucosal lesions were seen he did have several cutaneous telangiectasias.  His father did not have a strong history of HHT but did have the mucocutaneous telangiectasias.  Given that HHT sometimes shows incomplete penetrance, the father may have had a milder form.  Thus this patient has unequivically met 2 out of the 4 criteria and may have met 3 or 4 out of 4 depending upon how liberal one is with judging his situation.

Specific to this patient's presentation is the pulmonary ateriovenous malformations.  Pulmonary AVM's are a rare condition and have relatively few causes.  50-70% of pulmonary AVM's are caused by HHT.  The other causes include hepatopulmonary syndrome(hepatic cirrhosis), trauma, and metastatic thyroid cancer.  The radiographic findings in HHT are usually related to arteriovenous malformations.  Chest X-rays are usually abnormal in patients with pulmonary AVM's.  These CXR's have a round mass with linear vasculature markings entering and leaving.  The CXR however is not specific in differentiating the lesion from other causes of masses in the lungs.  The CT scan with contrast can further delineate the mass by showing that it has the same consitency as the blood vessels.  Often the dilated artery feeding and dilated vein draining the AVM can be identified.  Angiography may not be needed for diagnosis but can definitely demonstrate the vascular nature of the lesion and is often performed durning therapuetic interventions. Other studies include contrast echocardiography, radionuclide perfusion lung scan, shung fraction measurement, and MRI.

As alluded to previously HHT is being recognized as a cause of more serious morbidity and mortality than previously thought. Some of the more serious complications are TIA, CVA, and brain abscess, all thought to result from clots bypassing the pulmonary capillary bed.  Other complications include seizures, intracerebral hemorrhage, especially if associated with intracranial AVM, hemoptysis, high output CHF from shunting and polycythemia. This patient does not currently exhibit any of these more serious complications but does have clubbing of the digits which is suggestive of chronic hypoxia.

The treatment of pulmonary AVM's in HHT is aimed at preventing the more serious complications of the disease, i.e. the neurological and cardiopulmonary complications. Treatment for large AVM's greater than 2 cm in diameter or with a feeding artery greater than 3 mm in diameter is either surgical ligation or intravascular embolization. Embolization is the preferred method as this spares the normal lung tissue that may be removed or damaged in surgical resection.  Embolization also has the benefit of being less invasive and angiography done at that time may detect other lesions in need of treatment.  Small lesions may not need to be treated and it is worth restating that the treatment of the pulmonary AVM's is done to reduce the risk of serious strokes, brain abscesses, and other neurological complicaiton.
