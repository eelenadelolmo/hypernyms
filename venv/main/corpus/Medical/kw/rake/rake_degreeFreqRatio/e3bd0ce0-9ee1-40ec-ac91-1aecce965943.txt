Texto: 
Sedimentation rate >120.
Normal WBC count.
Patient had subsequent amputation of the first digit.
Plain radiographs demonstrate cortical discontinuity in distal first phalanx with associated lucency.  No soft tissue swelling.

MRI:
Low T1, High T2 signal in distal phalanx of 1st digit with cortical discontinuity and enhancement. Associated subcutaneous edema without a soft tissue abscess.
OSTEOMYELITIS
Osteomyelitis
33 year old African American female with history of diabetes and hypertension.
Given cortical discontinuity and associated marrow signal changes, findings were consistent with osteomyelitis given patient's underlying medical disease.
