Figure 1. Patient A. Tc-99m HMPAO tagged WBC study demonstrates normal biodistribution of the radiopharmaceutical as well as a focal region of linear uptake in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen.

Figure 2. Patient A. Contrast enhanced CT through the pelvis demonstrates a loop of small bowel with wall thickening abutting the right pelvic sidewall. 

Figure 3. Patient B. F-18 FDG PET axial image through pelvis demonstrates focal linear FDG avidity.

Figure 4. Patient B. Non-contrast CT of pelvis demonstrates a loop of small bowel with wall thickening. There is mild surrounding mesenteric edema as well as prominence of the surrounding fat. 

Figure 5. Patient B. PET image fused with the CT image (studies were obtained simultaneously). Correlation of FDG avidity to thickened small bowel loop.

Figure 6. Patient A. Selected image from a small bowel follow-through concentrating on the right lower quadrant. Demonstration of narrowing of the terminal ileum (a ‚Äústring‚Äù sign), surrounding mass effect and effacement of the cecum. Study was obtained several months after the previously shown Tc-99m HMPAO/WBC study.
Crohn's Disease on PET and Tc-99m HMPAO tagged WBC Scanning
Crohn's Disease (Known diagnosis)
Two patients with the same diagnosis, the request for the studies read "assess disease status".
