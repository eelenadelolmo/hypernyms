Texto: 
multiple metaphyseal lucencies arranged perpendicular to the long axis of the bone.  Some show the characteristic "corner fracture"--thicker peripheral rim more readily visible and appearing as a triangular fragment.
Classic Metaphyseal Lesion- Non-Accidental Trauma
classic metaphyseal lesions of non-accidental trauma
30 day old female with physical exam findings suspicious for non-accidental trauma
This is child is so young, that the injuries can not be satisfactorily explained by their own activity - implying non-accidental injuries.  A child that is not crawling or walking cannot easily fall.
