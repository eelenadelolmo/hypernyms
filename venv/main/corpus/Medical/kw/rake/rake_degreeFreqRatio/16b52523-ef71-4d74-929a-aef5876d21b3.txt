MR images shows multiple masses in the periphery of both cerebellar hemispheres, in the  fourth  ventricle and along the pial surface of the spinal cord .
disseminated medulloblastoma
the differential diagnosis of CSF disseminated tumors includes:
• medulloblastoma
• other primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET)
• germ cell (pineal region) tumors
• ependymoma

Medulloblastomas are malignant primitive neuroectodermal tumors involving the cerebellum, and are the most common type of neoplasm to disseminate along the CSF pathways.

At least one report indicated that contrast-enhanced MR imaging is more sensitive (83%) than CSF cytologic analysis (60%–78%) in establishing the presence of CSF dissemination, even when multiple CSF samples were obtained.
