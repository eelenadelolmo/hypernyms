Neurologic exam: Slurred speech. Oriented only to year and name. Poor concentration. Bilateral nystagmus. Positive for weakness 2/5 in proximal muscles of upper and lower extremity. Decreased vibratory sensation in feet and ankles. Bilateral upgoing toes. Unable to stand on own. 

Labs: Sodium on admission was 171 mEq/L with glucose 105mg/dL. 6 hours later Na++ =169mEq/L; 24 hours later  Na++ =164 mEq/L; 48 hours later  Na++ =138 mEq/L.
Sodium has been maintained at normal levels. Patient is working with physical therapy
Central pontine MRI signal abnormalities with sparing of the peripheral pontine fibers. T1 signal hypointense, T2  and FLAIR signal hyperintense. Mild diffusion restriction with corresponding low ADC.
Osmotic Myelinolysis, Central Pontine Myelinolysis
Pontine ischemia, demyelinating disease or metabolic disease.
50 y.o. man with EtOH abuse presenting with intoxication and hypernatremia. Complains of progressive upper and lower extremity weakness on Day 5 of admission
Formerly known as central pontine myelinolysis, osmotic demyelination syndrome is classically seen in association of rapid correction of hyponatremia but can occasionally be seen on cases of rapid correction of hypernatremia, as seen in this case. Chronic hypernatremia should be corrected slowly due to the risk of brain edema which may lead to brain herniation, permanent neurologic deficits and lysis of myelin. In this case, the time course of the hypernatremia was unknown. Typical presentation is usually neurologic deterioration 48-72 hours after the sodium level has been corrected. Pseudobulbar palsy and spastic quadriplegia are two of the physical findings often associated with the syndrome.   There is a large spectrum of outcomes ranging from complete recovery to a total “locked in” state which may progress to coma and even death.
