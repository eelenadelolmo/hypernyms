Full optic disks.  
Right upper and lower extremity weakness
Surgical removal only
3-4 cm left temporal lobe mass with surrounding vasogenic edema and entrapment of temporal horn of lateral ventricle.  Irregular contrast enhancement.
Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytoma
•  Glioblastoma Multiforme
•  PNET
•  DNET
•  Abscess
•  Pilocytic Astrocytoma
14 year old boy presents with headache and right sided weakness
The enhancing characteristics of the mass and the large amount of surrounding edema and lack of a cystic component made preoperative diagnosis of JPA difficult at best.  More aggressive tumor was suspect based on the imaging study.
