Normal breast exam without mass, nipple discharge, or skin retraction.
Surgical Excision
Screening mammogram in May of 2003 demonstrates irregular density in posterior third of the right breast that is seen only on the cranial-caudal view.

Callback diagnostic mammogram consisting of spot compression views demonstrates persistence of the irregular density.

Since the density could not be seen on orthogonal views, the patient was referred for an MRI of the breasts for further evaluation.  MRI showed a 1.2 cm mass in the posterior third of the right breast which enhanced more avidly than the rest of the breast parenchyma.  Time-enhancement curves for the mass were not suggestive of malignancy.
Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast (Confirmed by MRI-guided core biopsy)
1.  Primary breast cancer (most commonly infiltrating ductal carcinoma)
2.  Single metastatic foci in the right breast (unlikely, especially without a known primary)
3.  Benign breast mass (such as a fibroadenoma)
4.  Intramammary lymph node
History of atypical ductal hyperplasia discovered by biopsy of right breast several years ago.
This case demonstrates the facility of MRI evaluation of the breast.  Since this lesion was not seen in both views of the mammogram, an ultrasound would be very low yield as a diagnostic study.  MRI, however, demonstrated the affinity of the mass for contrast and raised suspicion of malignancy.  Another important point this case illustrates is that even though time-enhancement curves are not suggestive of malignancy, the mass may still be malignant.  Additionally, this case is a good example of how MR can be used in the acquisition of tissue for pathological evaluation.
