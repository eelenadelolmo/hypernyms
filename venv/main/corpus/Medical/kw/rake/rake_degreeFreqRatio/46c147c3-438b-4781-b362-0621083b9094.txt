MRI:  Bone marrow edema within the lateral cuneiform bone with transverse fracture line.  Thickened plantar fascia with high T2 signal near calcaneal insertion also was seen consistent with plantar fasciitis.

-stress fracture

Foot pain.  History of plantar fasciitis.
This patient had a history of plantar fasciitis, confirmed by MR imaging and likely contributed to altered weight bearing with subsequent stress fracture of the cuneiform bones.
