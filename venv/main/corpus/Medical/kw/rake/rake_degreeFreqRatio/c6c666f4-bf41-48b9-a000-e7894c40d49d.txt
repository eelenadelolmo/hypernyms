On exam, the patient had TTP very well localized to the LLQ with borderline peritoneal signs.  The patient was afebrile with only a mildly elevated WBC count.
On imaging, there is an ovoid, fat density structure (slightly greater than normal fat attenuation), adjacent to the sigmoid colon.  There is a hyperdense rim with some surrounding fat stranding.  There is a central focus of increased density.
Epiploic Appendagitis
These findings are characteristic of primary epiploic appendagitis.
42 yo white male with acute onset LLQ pain.
