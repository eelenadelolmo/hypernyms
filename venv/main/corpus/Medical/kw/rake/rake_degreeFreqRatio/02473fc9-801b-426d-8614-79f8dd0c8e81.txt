Texto: 
Mild right upper quadrant tenderness with otherwise unremarkable physical examination.  The liver transaminases were mildly elevated.
Air in the gall bladder can be an expected finding after stenting or surgical procedure and does not require treatment.  Pneumobilia from cholecystitis is a much more serious finding for which urgent surgical referral is warranted.
The axial CT images of the abdomen demonstrate the presence of a common bile duct stent with proximal portion near the cystic duct and distal portion in the duodenum. There is an air/fluid level in the gall bladder and air within the hepatic biliary system.
Pneumobilia
Differential diagnosis includes pneumobilia from infection, recent surgical procedure such as sphincterotomy or stenting or fistula formation between bowel and the gall bladder.
45 year old woman with history of painless jaundice and recent common bile duct stenting.
This patient underwent an MRCP prior to stenting which did not reveal the presence of a common bile duct stone. Further imaging eventually led to the discovery of a pancreatic head mass requiring surgical excision.
