Right eye proptosis
Children with NF1 should be monitored for developmental progress and should be seen yearly for neurological exams. More about general treatment for NF1 patients will be discussed in the discussion.  As for her specific findings on this CT study, treatment and follow-up are as follows:

Plexiform neurofibroma:  Lesions usually involve multiple nerve fascicles with significant vascularity. Thus, surgical excision is generally difficult and frustrating, with excessive bleeding and a poor cosmetic result. Repeated debulking may be necessary for severe symptoms, and orbital evisceration for extensive cases. Radiotherapy offers no benefit. However, farnesyl transferase inhibitors, which inhibit growth of these tumors in animals, are a possible treatment in the future and are currently undergoing clinical trials.  Of concern, there is a small risk of malignant transformation of these tumors. They may occasionally erode into the anterior cranial fossa, which results in death.

Optic nerve glioma:  The radiologist of this case recommended further evaluation with MRI of the brain and orbits. If the MRI is positive for an optic nerve glioma, MRI and an ophthalmic exam are repeated every 3-6 months. Otherwise, if vision is ok, observation is the treatment. If the tumor progresses, the child should be referred to neurooncology for evaluation.  Surgical excision is offered if a tumor approaches the chiasm. Surgery also is indicated for pain or disfiguring proptosis. The role of radiotherapy remains controversial; it may be associated with CNS complications. More recently, chemotherapy has shown promising results.
•	A soft tissue mass noted laterally to the lateral rectus muscle in the pre and post septal portions of the right orbit 
•	Asymmetry of the CSF-containing spaces in the middle cranial fossa, larger on the right without mass effect on the temporal lobe.
•	Right sphenoid wing hypoplasia causing deformity of the right orbit, which is widened and flattened posteriorly rather than conical.
•	Right optic nerve has a globular appearance near the orbital fissure

•	Unenhanced brain parenchyma demonstrates no abnormality. 
•	Globes are symmetrical in size and appearance
•	Left optic nerve is unremarkable
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), right orbital plexiform neurofibroma, sphenoid wing hypoplasia, possible optic nerve glioma.
Soft tissue mass
•	Plexiform neurofibroma of the orbit
•	Dermoid cyst
•	Infectious (lacrimal gland, orbital cellulitis)
•	Other sarcoma (i.e. rhabdomyosarcoma, lipoma)
•	Lymphoma

Right Middle Fossa Fluid
•	Epidermoid cyst
•	Arachnoid cyst

Sphenoid wing hypoplasia
•	Bone dysplasia secondary to plexiform neurofibroma
•	Congenital bony malformation
•	Trauma

Right optic nerve globular appearance
•	Optic nerve glioma
•	Suprasellar germinoma
•	Craniopharyngioma
•	Infiltrative disorders such as sarcoidosis, lymphoma, and Langerhans histiocytosis.
21 month old girl with proptosis
Our patient has been given the definitive diagnosis of NF1 because of the plexiform neurofibroma and sphenoid hypoplasia.  It is a likely assumption that the optic nerve mass is an optic nerve glioma given this patient’s diagnosis of NF1.  Follow-up MRI should reveal a hypotense to isotense T1 signal and variable intensity compared to muscle on T2 weighted imaging.  Enhancement with gadolinium is also variable. Typically, the lesion appears as a fusiform enlargement of the optic nerve, possibly involving the optic chiasm. The nerve may appear kinked with cystic spaces.

If no potential problem develops, this 2 year old needs yearly medical visits to include physical exam, ophthalmologic exam, growth measurements, assessment for precocious puberty, developmental assessment, and review of educational progress. Also, as previously mentioned, because of her tumors, she would need a follow-up MRI every 3-6 months.  Obviously, this management involves a multidisciplinary team involving genetics, neurology, ophthalmology, dermatology, neurosurgery, and plastic surgery.
