Physical Examination reveals gait ataxia and nystagmus.
&#932;he patient is being followed up at one year intervals. The clinical profile is stable. The patient presented in our imaging facility in November.  A followup brain MRI scan performed one year later, in another imaging facility, disclosed no substantial difference in the size and the mass effect of the epidermoid cyst.
• MR Imaging of the brain  reveals the presence of a multilobulated ,extra-axial cystic appearing mass expanding the forth ventricle. 
• The mass displays  CSF-like signal intensity on T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences . There is heterogeneity of the internal structure of the mass. FLAIR sequence does not completely null the signal intensity of the mass. 
• Diffusion-Weighted Imaging shows restricted diffusion within the mass.
Intracranial epidermoid cyst
• &#913;rachnoid cyst
• Dermoid cyst
• Cystic neoplasm
• Parasitic cyst
• Epidermoid cyst
This 75-year old woman presents with a history of progressive ataxia over a period of 6 months. &#932;he patient was referred to our facility for further work up.
Before starting our examination, we reviewed  the images of the first Brain MRI scan (done in another radiology facility) and we  noticed minimal enhancement at the margins of the forth ventricular lesion. Diffusion Weighted Imaging has not been performed in the first Brain MRI scan.  
Lesion's  morphologic and signal intensity features on T1 , T2 and FLAIR sequences as well as the restricted diffusion displayed on DWI-ADC maps supported the diagnosis of epidermoid cyst obviating the need for using contrast medium.
