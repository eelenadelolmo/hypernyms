71-year-old woman, about 5 days ago started having some altered mental status, was just confused about where she was, what the year was, as well as having some left leg pain, left leg weakness. She had a CT scan of the head that showed some edema in the right MCA distribution. The concern was stroke versus mass.  Her only complaint at this time is confusion and some mild left leg pain and a little left leg weakness. She has not had any difficulty ambulating or any change in her speech nor she has not noticed any facial droop or weakness in her arms.
