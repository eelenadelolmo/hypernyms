Exam revealed large asymptomatic abdominal mass.
The patient is still recovering from surgery.  However the post op course thus far has been unremarkable.
-Large (mean 12cm) mass arising from cortex of kidney.  Look for ‚Äúclaw‚Äù sign: kidney tissue extending around part of mass showing organ of origination.
-Usually exophytic growth with a pseudocapsule.
-Cystic areas in tumor: hemorrhage, necrosis.
-<15% have calcifications.
-Intrarenal mass effect causes distortion of the pyelocalyceal system.
-Less contrast enhancement than residual renal parenchyma.
-Vascular invasion in 5-10% (renal vein, IVC, right atrium).
Wilms Tumor
-Neuroblastoma
-Mesoblastic nephroma
-Multilocular cystic nephroma
-Clear cell sarcoma
-Rhabdoid tumor
-Wilms tumor
A  2 yo female emergent air evacuation from Europe for newly discovered large abdominal mass.
This case demonstrates many of the classic findings associated with Wilms tumors, most notably the claw sign.  It also displays how large the mass can get and how there is such marked mass effect.  Note how there is an absence of calcifications in the mass, making it easier to differentiate this from neuroblastoma.
