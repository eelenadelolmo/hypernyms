Texto: 
Weakness in arms and legs after the fall.  Neck pain also noted
Decompression of craniocervical junction with fusion
CT and MRI show classic findings of Ankylosing spondylitis with "squaring"of vertebral bodies, fusion of the facets and spinous processes and calcifications of the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments.  
There is an unfused fracture through the base of the odontoid which is fused to the arch of C1 and the clivus. There is cord injury at this level due to hyperophic boney changes and cord compression 
There are also classic changes of achondroplasia.
Ankylosing Spondylitis in an Anchondroplasitic dwarf.
â€¢ Achondroplasia
â€¢ Reiter's disease
â€¢ Psoriatic arthritis
â€¢ Ankylosing spondylitis
46 year old  woman with a known diagnosis, fell down steps.
The woman had a known diagnosis of achondroplasia. Ankylosing spondylitis is unusual in women and is not commonly associated with Achondroplasia.
