Examination: 0.8mm pink, dome-shaoed nodule on dorsurn of left middle toe.
Course: Current treatment is excisional biopsy. These lesions regress or involute spontaneously 12% of the time even after partial resection, usually within 4 years. Patient's father was instructed to return if lesion recurred. Recurrence does occur 60% of the time after excision. Further surgical treatment is only recommended in cases where there is functional impairment or aggressive growth. Topical corticosteroids with or without occlusion have not shown any benefit; however, intralesional corticosteroids may prove beneficial.
Histopathology: The biopsy shows a non-encapsulated tumor extending beneath the epidermis through the dermis and the subcutis. The tumor is composed of spindle cells with blunt, vesicular nuclei arranged in interweaving fascicles. Characteristic intracytoplasmic paranuclear eosinophilic globules measuring approximately 5 to 9 mm in diameter are noted in the spindle cells.
Case 28 (27th Annual Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, 2003) INFANTILE DIGITAL FIBROMATOSIS
History: 5 year old Caucasian boy with a three month history of nontender, nonpruritic growth on dorsal left middle toe over the distal phalaynx. The lesion initially started as a "mosquito bite" and continued to grow to its current stable size of 0.8mm.
