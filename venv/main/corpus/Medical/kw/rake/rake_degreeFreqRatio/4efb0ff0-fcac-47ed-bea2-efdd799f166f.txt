Texto: 
Patient has diffuse swelling of the right heel and tenderness to palpation along the posterior, lateral and medial aspects of the heel. Pain is worsened with forced flexion of the ankle. (Meyer et al., 1993).
Patient was conservatively managed with cessation from all athletic activity for 6 weeks. Follow-up radiographs were used to evaluate healing.
Plain film demonstrates sclerotic fracture line perpendicular to trabecular pattern of the calcaneus. T1 weighted image demonstrates dark fracture line with decreased signal suggesting bone marrow edema. T2 weighted image demonstrates fracture line and increased signal.
Stress Fracture of the calcaneus
inflammatory disease, infection, neoplasm, complete fracture, stress fracture.
30 year-old male long physician presents with persistent right heel pain. Patient is a long distance runner.
