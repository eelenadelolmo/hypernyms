Texto: 
General:  Alert, active, in NAD
Vitals:  pulse 117, respirations 24, BP 111/69, Temp. 37.3
HEENT:  eyes are normal without Lisch nodules
Skin:  multiple cafe-au-lait spots, one large spot over back and thigh, a total of 10-15 spots >1cm
MS:  back is straight without evidence of scoliosis
No treatment, a follow-up MRI will be obtained to ensure no growth.  However, the National Neurofibromatosis Foundation does not recommend neuroimaging for screening in asymptomatic children with NF1.
Yearly ophthamologic exam to evaluate for Lisch nodules and optic gliomas.
Yearly BP check since hypertension is frequent in patients with NF1 and can occur at any age.
Regular growth assessments since most NF1 patients have short stature and check for scoliosis which occurs in 10-25% of affected individuals.
Developmental evaluations.
Increase signal in globus pallidus bilaterally which does not enhance.  There are also area of abnormal signal in the cerebellum.
Hamartoma 2nd to NF-1
Hamartoma
Low grade tumor
Heterotopias
Myelination disorder
Gliosis
The patient is a 7 y/o Caucasian male who presented for evaluation after confirmation of a positive family history of neurofibromatosis type 1 (mother, older brother, and maternal grandmother).  He also presented with cafe-au-lait spots shortly after birth.  Developmentally, the patient was in the 25% for height and weight and 70% for head circumference and had some speech problems.  The patient was otherwise healthy.  Last year his mother was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme.
A hamartoma is a lesion made of normal cells in an abnormal location.  They are one of many brain lesions seen in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1.  The important aspect is to differentiate a hamartoma from an astrocytoma, glioma, or other CNS tumor.  A hamartoma should not enhance since enhancement usually indicates an actively growing tumor.  Also, there should be very little or no growth.  Clinically, the patient should be asymptomatic.
