Normal exam and labs
Pyloromyotomy. Follow-up UGI significant for reflux.
US: 
The pylorus is found near the gallbladder and is elongated. There is increased thickness of the hypoechoic pylorus muscle surrounding the echogenic central mucosa. (The hypertrophied pylorus muscle is hypoechoic and surrounds the central echogenic mucosa, which appears as parallel echogenic lines in between the hypoechoic areas)  The thickness of the muscle is 2.9mm  The pylorus is not seen to open during real-time evaluation.  The proximal end of thickened pylorus is seen to protrude into the gastric antrum, which is called the "tit" sign.
Pyloric Stenosis
Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (HPS)
Pylorospasm
18 day old white infant with severe vomiting with every meal. Unable to tolerate any PO intake for last 24 hrs.
The criteria for diagnosing HPS is based on the thickness of the pylorus muscle.  If >3mm, this is 100% specific for HPS. However, when the thickness lies between 2-3mm, the differential is pylorospasm vs. HPS.  It is important to differentiate between the two because HPS, though not a surgical emergency, is treated surgically with a pyloromyotomy whereas pylorospasm is treated conservatively and usually gets better in 24-48hrs. The best management for a patient with a measurement between 2-3mm is conservative and repeat ultrasound in 24-48hrs. HPS will progress and if thickness increases 24-48 hrs later, pt needs to go to surgery. If thickness decreases, pt most likely had pylorospasm and does not need surgery.
