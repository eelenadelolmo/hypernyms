Exercise SPECT MPI 
A one-day stress-rest technetium (Tc)-99m tetrofosmin perfusion study was performed.   Exercise stress testing was performed on a treadmill using the Bruce protocol.  Approximately 11 mCi of  Tc-99m tetrofosmin was injected at rest, and 31 mCi injected during stress.  Gated myocardial perfusion imaging was performed with attenuation correction using vantage software.  The patient exercised 16:11 minutes on Bruce protocol, stopping because of shortness of breath.  Had experienced chest pain during the test.  Resting heart rate & blood pressure were 59 beats/min and 118/64 mm Hg.  Maximum heart rate & blood pressure during exercise were 181 beats/min (105% maximal predicted heart rate) and 162/60 mm Hg.  Maximum workload  = 19.0 METs.  There was no electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia during exercise, Duke Treadmill Score = 16.0 (Low-risk score). 

Images are shown without (Figure 1) and with (Figure 2) attenuation correction applied.  Image quality was adequate.
Patient was given full clearance to perform all physical duties for his National Guard Service.  He was counselled again on the importance of quitting smoking.
The SPECT myocardial perfusion scan raw data showed good image quality with a normal-sized left ventricle.  There was a medium-sized fixed inferior perfusion abnormality with moderate reduction in counts on the perfusion scans (Figure 1).  The attenuation corrected scans show essentially normal perfusion (Figure 2).  The quality control indices for the stress and rest studies showed normal counts and no truncation.  Post stress gated images demonstrate a left ventricular ejection fraction of 59 percent with normal wall motion, and a normal left ventricular end diastolic volume of 124 ml.  The ventricular cavity was not larger in stress than in rest images, with a transient ischemic dilatation (TID) ratio is 0.77 (normal < 1.20).

The patient exercised 16:11 minutes on Bruce protocol, stopping because of shortness of breath.  Had no chest pain during the test.  Resting heart rate & blood pressure were 59 bpm and 118/64 mm Hg.  Maximum heart rate & blood pressure during exercise were 181 bpm (105% maximal predicted heart rate) and 162/60 mm Hg.  Maximum workload  = 19.0 MET.  The peak double product or pressure-rate product was 29322.  The Post exercise 1 minute fall in heart rate (heart rate recovery)=42 (normal >=12 bpm).  There was no electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of ischemia during exercise, Duke Treadmill Score = 16.0 (Low-risk score). 

The SPECT myocardial perfusion scan raw data showed good image quality with a normal-sized left ventricle.  There was a medium-sized fixed inferior perfusion abnormality with moderate reduction in counts on the perfusion scans (Figure 1).  The attenuation corrected scans showed a small-sized fixed inferior perfusion abnormality with mild reduction in counts (Figure 2).  Corrected stress images demonstrate a remaining area of mildly decreased apical activity which is consistent with normal thinning.  The quality control indices for the stress and rest studies showed normal counts and no truncation.  Post stress gated images demonstrate a left ventricular ejection fraction of 59 percent with normal wall motion, and a normal left ventricular end diastolic volume of 124 ml.  The ventricular cavity was not larger in stress than in rest images, with a transient ischemic dilatation (TID) ratio is 0.77 (normal < 1.20).

• Normal myocardial perfusion imaging study with inferior wall attenuation artifact that corrected after application of attenuation correction software.
This 47 year old man presented for a screening exercise treadmill nuclear stress test as required screening for National Guard Service.  His cardiac risk factors included cigarette smoking (half packet per day) and hypercholesterolemia.   He reports no symptoms at this time, and is physically active.  Per the National Guard Requirements, because of an early repolarization abnormality on his baseline electrocardiogram, he was referred for an exercise technetium-99m tetrofosmin SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) study to rule out significant coronary artery disease.
This case illustrates the importance of soft tissue attenuation as a prominent cause of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging artifacts, which may result in reduced diagnostic accuracy of myocardial perfusion imaging.  The application of commercial SPECT attenuation correction systems improves accuracy in these cases.

The importance of the exercise portion of this patients test is also highlighted here.  Given the excellent functional capacity & the normal hemodynamic, electrocardiographic and low-risk Duke Treadmill Score, his risk for future cardiac events is very low.  The nuclear images in this case confirmed an overall normal scan once attenuation correction processing was applied.
