Cholangiocarcinoma is a malignant tumor arising from the bile duct epithelium. Although rare, cholangiocarcinoma is the second most common primary malignant hepatic neoplasm, accounting for approximately 8% of such tumors. On noncontrast CT cholangiocarcinoma is usually seen as a round or ovoid hypoattenuating mass with irregular borders.
