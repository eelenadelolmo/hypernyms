Radiation and chemotherapy
Expansile mass lesion involving the splenium of the corpus callosum.  The mass enhances homogeneously and produces a moderate amount of surrounding vasogenic edema.  The mass is not particularly bright on FLAIR and T2.
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
• Glioma (astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, oligoastrocytoma
• Primary CNS Lymphoma
• Tumefactive Demyelination
» MS, ADEM, Marchiafava-Bignami Disease, etc.
• Infection (Abscess, encephalitis, ventriculitis)
• Metastatic disease
58 year old man with 2 month history of personality changes and headache.
The increased cellularity of "small round blue cell tumors" - like lymphoma - often has a characteristic imaging appearance of high attenuation on pre-contrast CT, low signal on T1 and T2 MR, and low ADC/high signal on DWI.
