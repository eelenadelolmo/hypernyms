Texto: 
Chest: Diffuse solid tissue discrete from underlying muscle layer over left pectoralis muscle that continues under left axilla and over left shoulder and neck.  There is no color change to the skin.  The area is non-tender and non-mobile. 
Lungs are CTAB 
Ext: DTRs and distal pulses are normal and equal bilaterally in the UEs.  Full ROM, strength normal and equal bilaterally in UEs
CV: RRR with no M/R/Gs
Abd: Soft NT/ND with +abs
Infectious â€“ TB, reactive lymphadenitis, fungal
Neoplastic â€“ Lymphoma, soft tissue tumor, liposarcoma, metastatic disease
On the contrast CT of the chest there is a large mass that is beneath and discrete from the pectoralis muscle layer of the chest that stretches from the left pectoralis muscle under the left axilla.  It is not attached to any surrounding structures and has the density of surrounding soft tissue.  The mass appears to be a conglomeration of multiple enlarged lymph nodes.  These nodes are discrete from surrounding structures and do not appear to be invading any surrounding structure.  There appears to be a mass effect that is compressing the chest wall

The contrast CT of the abdomen shows hepatosplenomegaly with multiple densities seen in the spleen and a large density also visible in the liver.  There may also be enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes but it hard to determine from this image.
Stage IVB Non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma (Pre B-cell variety) diagnosed by biopsy
Infectious â€“ TB, reactive lymphadenitis, fungal
Neoplastic â€“ Lymphoma, soft tissue tumor, liposarcoma, metastatic disease
15 year old male with two months of progressive swelling over left chest, under left axilla, and left neck.  The patient has also had an unintentional 10 lb weight loss over the past six months.  Denies F/C/NS
Lymphoma (Hodgkinâ€™s or Non-Hodgkinâ€™s) is a common form of cancer that presents in a bimodal age distribution with a peak between 20-30 years of age and then a peak again around age 60.  Type is determined with histochemical testing of tumor cells.  Staging is done with CT or MRI.  Staging system is based on the Ann Arbor classification system and is I-IV with the A or B modifier.  
Stage I â€“ Single lymph node or organ   Stage II â€“ Two or more lymphoid organs on same side of diaphragm
Stage III -  Involvement on both sides of diaphragm   Stage IV â€“ Involvement of extralymphoid organs
Nodal involvement is determined with CT or MRI and a node is considered positive if greater than 8mm.  Tumors may be B-cell or T-cell in origin.  Treatment is almost exclusively chemotherapeutic in nature and is aimed at specific tumor type.  Specific type is determined by bone marrow aspiration and testing of cells.
