Again noted is severe cerebellar atrophy involving both the
cerebellar hemispheres and the vermis and disproportionate to the rest of the brain.  Since the last scan, flattening and atrophy of the pons appears to be slightly worsened from the previous examination, and the pons is definitely smaller than the comparison study from 2005 with a concave appearance to the inferior aspect.
