Increased renal parenchymal echogenicity.  Some foci demonstrate distal acoustic shadowing consistent with calcification.  

Increased echogenicity of the common bile duct, without ductal dilatation.  Variably increased GB wall thickness, with internal echogenicity (non-mobile, non-shadowing) consistent with sloughed GB mucosa or polyps.  GB not distended and no pericholecystic fluid.
