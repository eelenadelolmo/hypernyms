This case was treated with surgical resection.
Hyperlucent lobe(s)- with oligemia
Increased lobar opacity (rare) in newborn due to retained fetal lung fluid 
Compression atelectasis of adjacent parenchyma 
Contralateral mediastinal shift
Congenital Lobar Emphysema- Radiographic findings
Pneumothorax 
Atelectasis with compensatory hyperinflation 
Pneumatocele 
Cyst 
Diaphragmatic hernia 
Cystic adenomatoid malformation 
Foreign body
