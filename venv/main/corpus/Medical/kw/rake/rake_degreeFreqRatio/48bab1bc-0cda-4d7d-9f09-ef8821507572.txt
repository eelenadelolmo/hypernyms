Texto: 
The patinet is a cachectic, jaundiced, elderly asian female. Serum total bilirubin 14.9mg/Dl, Alkaline phosphatase 956 U/l.
>> Treatment for advanced disease usually includes chemotherapy (traditionally CHOP although this is evolving and has changed significantly over the last 30 years). 

>> Other interventions are usually palliative, as in this case where percutaneous biliary drainage followed by endobiliary stenting with internal drainage was performed.
>> CT Liver: infiltrative mass in right lobe of liver, intrahepatic biliary dilatation, lymphadenopathy.

>> Percutaneous cholangiogram and external biliary drain placement: mildly dilated intrahepatic biliary ducts, mass effect displaces common hepatic duct.

>> Percutaneous cholangiogram and endobiliary stent placement: Gore Viabil covered metallic stent allows internal drainage.
Large B cell lymphoma of the liver with malignant biliary obstruction
>> Hepatocellular carcinoma
>> Cholangiocarcinoma
One month of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
Key facts for biliary stenting of malignant obstructive jaundice:
>> It is palliative therapy.

>> Metal stents demonstrate longer patency than plastic (polyethylene) stents for malignant biliary obstruction (median expected patency: 250 and 110 days respectively).

>> This treatment provides significant palliation of patient symptoms due to biliary obstruction and is cost-effective in patients with longer than 6 months expected survival resulting in fewer hospital admissions.

>> Covered endobiliary stents like the Gore Viabil used in this case have good patency rates in malignant biliary obstruction and allow endobiliary drainage into the small bowel which is desirable for outpatient management of these patients.
