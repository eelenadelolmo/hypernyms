Cardio-Pulmonary: Symmetric expansion of thoracic cavity, lung spaces clear to auscultation bilaterally. On cardiac exam, there were no heaves or thrills, and auscultation revealed S1, S2, no gallops, murmurs, or rubs. 

Focused musculoskeletal exam: Some healed scarring on the anterior aspects of the knees, otherwise no gross visible deformities of the hip, knee or ankle joints. Physical examination of the joints was normal except for the left knee which was found to have recuvatum, vauge pain on passive and active range of motion test, increased posterior displacement during the posterior drawer test, a positive McMurray’s maneuver on varus and valgus motions, with greater varus stress laxity. There was no evidence of joint swelling, effusion, warmth, or redness. 

Neurologic: No abnormalities in gait. Ankle, knee, forearm, biceps, and triceps reflexes were 2+ bilaterally. No signs of muscle wasting or abnormal tone. Muscular strength was 5/5 at all joints bilaterally.
Persistent symptoms and functional limitations due to trauma to her left knee for six months prompted MRI which confirmed injury to the PCL and menisci. Patient will require orthopedic referral as well as fitment of knee brace to lock knee joint in extension. 

In cases of knee trauma the patient must be evaluated properly to determine the need for orthopedic referral (1): Grade 3 PCL injury, PCL injury associated with fractures or any additional soft tissue injury, or PCL disruption involving avulsion of the ligamentous insertion at the tibia. Initial treatment of a Grade 1 or 2 PCL injury involves basic management principles of PRICE-M (protection, rest, ice, compression, medications). Within the first 2-3 days the affected knee should be placed in a hinged knee brace, locked in full extension for two weeks to reduce posterior lag in the acutely injured knee. After two weeks, the brace is unlocked and the patient is allowed to begin progressive range of motion exercises. Once swelling has diminished and pain is controlled patients may begin rehabilitation, often patients can begin within a few days following an acute isolated PCL injury. These include plantar and dorsi-flexion of the ankles, contraction of the quadriceps while the knee is in full extension, ultimately requiring full strength and function of the quadriceps for full recovery. The goal of early rehabilitation is to prevent joint stiffness improvement in mobility. Strengthening of the quadriceps is essential as rehabilitation continues as it compensates for the PCL deficient knee. Total rehabilitation may be anywhere from 13 to 25 weeks, with double that following PCL reconstruction. At this time, there is no evidence to determine the true prognosis or best approach to treatment for grade 1 or 2 PCL injuries as pre-mature osteoarthritis after PCL reconstruction has been found to be similar to or worse than those managed non-operatively (2). 

Grade III PCL injuries are indication for immediate orthopedic referral and operative treatment. Acute surgical intervention is more successful than attempts once the injury has become chronic with improvement of laxity by at least one grade. Surgical intervention should also be considered for patients with grade 1 or 2 injuries if multiple ligaments are involved in the trauma, PLC (posterolateral compartment) injury, or with persistent pain, instability, or disability refractory to conservative treatment. Isolated PCL injuries have better prognosis than PCL injuries involving associated structures, specifically the posterolateral compartment (PLC) which is considered to have the poorest prognosis. Overall PCL injuries have better prognosis than ACL injuries due to their inherent strength and vascularity giving the PCL greater healing capacity. The PCL’s proximity to neurovascular structures increases the risk of arterial occlusion and arteriograms may be performed for further evaluation to reverse ischemia and prevent infarction of distally supplied structures. With proper conservative measure and rehabilitation, most isolated grade 1 or 2 injuries show almost total recovery within one year, and those in combination with other structural knee injury recovery variably in relation to the extent of other injuries. Patients who undergo operative treatment can expect recovery within 6-12 months (3, 4). 

Meniscal injuries of acute onset are most often due to sudden deceleration and directional change while the foot is planted and knee is flexed; patients often describe a popping sensation as if the knee is giving out. The diagnosis of acute meniscal injury can be made on clinical grounds but must be differentiated from associated pathologies which may not be obvious at the time of injury but must be carefully assessed and ruled out (1, 5). Acutely the most significant associated injury is that of the ACL which would result in laxity as well as anterior displacement of the knee with a positive Lachman’s test; these findings are absent in an isolated meniscal injury. The diagnosis can be confirmed with MRI, however MRI is not always indicated in the acute setting unless other knee joint structure involvement cannot be ruled out (6). Initial management of isolated meniscal injuries starts with the basic principle of PRICE-M, crutches for pain relief, patellar restraining braces, and leg raises to maintain strength in the quadriceps. All meniscal tear treatment includes strengthening musculature support of the knee, defining the type and extent of tear, and determining the need for surgery. Conservative measures are exhausted prior to referral for surgery and is most successful if the symptoms developed within 1-2 days (vs immediately), swelling is minimal, the knee has full range of motion, and there is pain with McMurray’s only with deep flexion (7). 

In cases of severe swelling, effusions, or suspicion for hemarthrosis (8), arthrocentesis can be diagnostic (ACL or peripheral meniscal tear vs bone fracture which would contain fat globules in aspirate) and therapeutic. Larger tears typically have persistent effusions, and are in contact with the articular cartilage requiring weekly interval aspiration or a one time high dose corticosteroid injection. NSAIDs and cryotherapy have also been shown to control the pain and swelling in non-operative patients with meniscal injury. Severe twisting injury without being able to resume the activity afterwards, a locked knee (unable to extend completely), poor range of motion, pain on McMurrays with minimal flexion, and associated ACL (risk of hemarthrosis) are indications for immediate orthopedic surgical referral.  It has been shown that earlier surgical repair (within 3 months of injury) has improved outcomes and reduced complications such as osteoarthritis in severe meniscal injuries. Also, smaller tears which do not improve after 3-6 weeks of conservative treatment should also be referred. Consultation is also warranted for persistent effusions, or when MRI demonstrates a large or complex tear (9, 10). 

Typically, surgery is avoided in older patients with degenerative meniscal tearing. Of the two approaches, arthroscopic or open, partial arthroscopic meniscectomy with maximal preservation of functioning meniscus as possible is preferred due to quicker recovery and functional outcomes. The decision to undergo surgery is unique to each patient and depends on the frequency of symptoms, general knee functions (squatting, stability), type of tear, and likelihood that the unrepaired meniscus will lead to further damage of the articular cartilage. These factors will also determine if meniscal repair or excision (partial or total) will be preferred intra-operatively. Post-operatively after meniscectomy the patient is able to bear their full weight within one week but may require various modalities such as hot/cold contrasts, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), galvanic stimulation, phonophoresis, and pain management to decrease pain or swelling.  However, patients who underwent meniscus repair must post-pone full weight bearing for 4-6 weeks to avoid tensile and compressive forces at the site of repair in addition to a much longer rehabilitation compared to that of patients who undergo meniscectomy. Operative patients should follow structure rehabilitation programs similar to conservative management protocols with initial focus on improving limitations in range of motion and strengthening the muscles of the knee joint prior to starting tailored exercise regimens. Among surgical patients, patients less than 35 years old, with a vertical tear, without cartilage damage, and an intact meniscal repair post-operatively have the most favorable prognoses. As with other arthroscopic procedures there is an increased risk of osteoarthritis over time compared to the normal population, although it has been shown that meniscal repair leads to higher rates of return to athletics and a reduced risk of osteoarthritis compared to non-operative management (5, 10). Current there are few published studies are available comparing the results of non-operative and operative management for meniscal injuries, none of which are randomized and prospective.
Fig 1: Coronal and axial T2 MRI of L Knee – PCL and menisci 
On coronal view there is increased signal in the proximal PCL near its attachment at the femur as well as diffuse increased signal within the anterior lateral meniscus which is seen to extend to the superior articular cartilage. On axial view a foci of increased signaling in the proximal portion of the PCL is visible as well as slightly increased signal and blurring of meniscal space in the anterior portion of the lateral meniscus and posterior portion of the medial meniscus consistent with the friable appearance of maceration of the cartilage. 


Fig 2: Coronal and sagittal T2 MRI of L Knee – Lateral meniscus
Coronal view shows increased signaling throughout the lateral meniscus in various orientations consistent with a complex tear along with extension of abnormal signaling into the superior articular cartilage. On Sagittal view the lateral meniscal space is almost non-existent with diffusely spread increased signaling corresponding to maceration. 


Fig 3: Sagittal and coronal T2 MRI of  L Knee – PCL and medial meniscus 
On Sagittal view there is increased signaling near the proximal origin of the PCL. On coronal view areas of globular increased signal is seen at the periphery and free borders of the medial meniscus. 

Fig 4: Sagittal and Coronal T2 MRI of L Knee – PCL and medial meniscus
Compared to figure 3, moving medially on sagittal view there is a limiting of the high intensity signaling near the proximal origin of the PCL making a complete tear unlikely. On coronal view areas of globular increased signal is seen at the periphery and free borders of the medial meniscus. 

Fig 5: Axial and Sagittal T2 MRI of L Knee – Medial meniscus
On Sagittal view there is increased signaling near the posterior portion of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus. On axial view this area appears as slightly increased and friable signaling along the posterior border of the medial meniscus.  

Figure 6: Axial and Sagittal T2 MRI of L Knee – Medial meniscus 
Axial image progression medially shows same findings of increased friable signaling along the posterior border of the medial meniscus. However on sagittal view the posterior horn of the medial meniscus appears more lucent compared to figure 5 showing the limited extent of medial meniscal damage.
Proximal strain of the PCL along with complex tearing of the lateral meniscus and smaller tears of the medial meniscus.
Acute knee injury results from a high-energy force on the structures of the knee joint causing direct trauma or unfavorable displacement of anatomy loading soft tissue structures beyond their capacity to resist the force of impact. Common structures damaged in acute knee trauma include ACL, MCL, LCL injuries, as well as the lateral and medial collateral meniscal injury with twisting or rotational forces. Often the mechanism of injury can be elucidated from the patient history which aids in correlation with physical findings to identify which structures may be involved in the trauma.  In this patient, the force of impact was directed anteriorly just above the lateral knee joint on her posterior side. This caused anterior displacement and internal rotation of her distal femur with respect to her tibia. The subsequent impact with the ground caused posterior displacement of her tibia with respect to the rest of her body as she fell on her knees. In conjunction with her physical exam findings and MRI results the most likely diagnoses include PCL strain, complex tear of the lateral meniscus, and smaller tears of the medial meniscus
22 y. o. African American female was walking with a friend across a parking lot during the daytime in January 2016 when she heard a vehicle speeding up behind her.  She reports that she stepped to the left and looked over her left shoulder and saw the vehicle approaching towards her. Patient was swiped by the vehicle on the posterior-lateral aspect of her knee, at which point she recalls falling forward with her left knee flexed, losing consciousness for an unknown amount of time. She remembers waking up in her friend’s vehicle and as it was getting rammed in the front passenger side as they were in route to the hospital. Patient was evaluated per trauma protocol and placed in a C-collar for potential cervical injury, however x-rays showed no abnormalities. The patient was observed to maintain stable vitals, and negative for any signs or evidence traumatic and non-traumatic injury and released later that day. Patient reports severe pain in her neck, back, and lower extremities, difficulty ambulating, as well as moderate scratches on the front of her knees, and mild swelling of her left knee. The patient denied any gross traumatic deformity, blood loss, vision changes, difficulty breathing, chest pain, vomiting, or loss of bowel or bladder control. 

Six months after the incident patient continued to report left knee symptoms such as vague pain, especially on exertion, a sense of knee instability, and reported functional limitations in performing daily tasks. Findings consistent of PCL strain and meniscal injury on MRI prompted orthopedic referral, and fitment of knee brace to avoid further risk of injury and aid in rehabilitation. Unfortunately, patient did not present for her referral or brace fitment and was lost to follow up for six additional months, almost one year since the incident at the time of most recent visit. During this visit, she continues to endorse the same symptoms and limitations.

Past Medical History:
Patient has no chronic diagnoses, suffers from chronic back and neck pain which was made worse by her recent trauma. She has a history of prior MVA and lumbarization of vertebrae on incidental MRI.
Mohammad Iqball MSIV, Frank Mascaro MD, Randall Loftus MD, Joanna Garvey DC, Robert Lutnick MD, Scott Croce DC, Gary Smith DC, Krishnan Kartha MD, Joseph Serghany MD, Greg Feld MD, Vaseem Iqbal MD, Jennifer Sperrazza DC, Jeffrey Lieberman MD, Geoffrey Gerow DC.  This patient suffered from a direct trauma to the posterior-lateral aspect of her knee, causing her to fall on the anterior aspect of the knee upon impact with the ground. Per the patient history at the time of impact the patient was stepping with her left foot and facing over her left shoulder to visualize the motor vehicle approaching her. Based on her physical examination findings and MRI imaging it is apparent that she suffered damage to both lateral and medial menisci as well as associated strain injury to her PCL. 

The patient was likely stepping down with her left foot in mid knee flexion and the impact of the vehicle from behind caused a combination of rotational and sheer stress on her knee joint beyond the stabilization capability of her menisci. With the primary site of impact most likely on the posterior lateral aspect of the knee, displacement of the leg medially translates into a varus type stress causing greater damage to the lateral meniscus than the medial meniscus. 

The menisci are crescentic shaped fibrocartilage pads found within the knee joint laterally and medially between the femoral condyles and tibial plateaus. Both menisci are wedge shaped in cross section, thinning out away from their attachment at their root to the joint capsule. Each meniscus is divided into three zones: the anterior horn, posterior horn, and the intermediate (pars media) near the periphery. At their roots the menisci are also attached to their respective cruciate ligaments, with the lateral meniscus being less rigidly attached to the LCL providing it greater mobility and protection from injury compared to the medial meniscus. The lateral meniscus is also more C – shaped and has a shorter radius.  Blood supply to the menisci is predominantly at the periphery and are from branches of the geniculate arteries which do not penetrate into the inner menisci to aid in healing (11). 

Acute meniscal injury is almost always due to sudden deceleration from a planted foot with the knee in flexion and abrupt directional change causing twisting, rotational, or sheer stress on the menisci. With the foot planted and an internally rotated femur, valgus stress applied to a flexed knee can cause medial meniscal injury, while varus stress with the femur externally rotated can cause lateral meniscal injury.  The menisci also function to dissipate loading forces on the knee as well as maintain smoothness of knee extension which may worsen after acute trauma or due to long term chronic degeneration in patients with osteoarthritis or obesity.

Acute meniscal tears are followed by insidious onset of pain and joint line tenderness, with ambulation possible after small tears, and early restriction of knee motion with severe tears. Patients with severe trauma to menisci often describe a buckling or popping sensation at the time of injury from transient lodging of a meniscal fragment in the joint space. This gives a sensation similar to that described in ACL injuries of the knee giving way due to instability of the joint which would not be present in isolated meniscal injury. Acute meniscal injuries cause joint effusions within hours, or even minutes in tears of the vascularized peripheral menisci due to the risk of hemarthrosis (also commonly found in ACL injury). Patients will also report locking of the knee on extension between 20-45 degrees from entrapment of a meniscal fragment or joint effusion which may limit mobility of the knee. Involvement of the ACL, MCL, and LCL is common and associated symptoms and signs of these respective injuries should be elicited and evaluated for (1, 5). Patients should be examined for joint line tenderness, abnormal motion (inability to fully extend knee, loss of smooth motion), inability to squat or kneel, catching on McMurrays, pain on Thessaly test, Apley test, and presence of joint effusions. 

The menisci have a unique triangular shape and lucent appearance on MRI, and abnormalities cause deformities of the meniscal space, increased signaling within the menisci in various orientation due to different tearing patterns, meniscal extrusions, and loss of cartilage. MRI should include all three segments of the menisci (the anterior horn, the body, and the posterior horn) to assess for increased meniscal signal with communication to the inferior, superior, or free edge of the meniscal surface on at least two consecutive images. In the case of a radial tear, visibility of increased signal on both coronal and sagittal views is suffice. Other indirect findings of meniscal injury on MRI are focal subchondral bone marrow edema beneath the meniscus and presence of a para-meniscal cyst (high intensity signal fluid collection T2) near the meniscus with visible fluid tracking into the periphery (12). 


This patient’s PCL strain may be of multiple etiologies resulting from the direct high energy trauma as the vehicle struck her from behind at a level above the knee joint, as well as the abrupt impact of her knee on the ground as the remainder of her body continued to fall forward. Both of these events cause the tibia to be displaced posteriorly relative to the femur consistent with grade II PCL strain, or partial tear. In addition, abrupt pretibial impact and excessive stress on the PCL secondary to meniscal tearing are responsible for the PCL strain in this patient. 

The PCL originates from the lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle and inserts at the posterior tibia in the depression known as the fovea centralism between the medial and lateral tibial plateaus.  It primarily functions as a restraint to posterior translation of the tibia with respect to femur, but is also involved in resisting external rotation of the tibia, as well as protecting the knee from hyper extension, varus, and valgus stress.

PCL injury is most often due to pretibial trauma, hyperflexion, or hyperextension of the knee related relative posterior displacement of tibia to the femur. In this patient laxity elicited on the posterior drawer test and a visible recurvatum on the left knee is indicative of PCL damage which was confirmed with increased signal on MRI. The PCL is the least frequently injured structure of the knee joint as it is the largest, strongest, and most vascularized collateral ligament and is rarely injured in isolation. When in isolation it is often sports related due to impact on the anterior knee or hyperflexion of the knee. PCL injuries occur in combination with other structural injuries of the knee almost >90% of the time and in this patient, her PCL strain is associated with her meniscal injuries as these structures mechanically linked in stabilizing the knee (3). 

On physical examination, the knee joint may appear hyper-extended due to posterior subluxation of the tibia. Maneuvers such as the posterior drawer test, posterior sag test, and quadriceps active tests (13) will also produce similar findings of increased posterior displacement of the tibia with respect to the femoral condyles. With regards to classifying PCL injuries the magnitude of posterior translation measured during the posterior drawer test is used to grade the injury (Grade 1:  0 to 5mm, Grade 2: 5 to 10 mm visible as the anterior border of the medial tibeal plateau being flush with the medial femoral condyle, Grade 3: >10 mm). Grade 2 injuries are partial tears, while grade 3 injuries indicate complete tears of the PCL

As always inspection, palpation, range of motion, and strength of the knee joint should be assessed. Effusions associated with acute PCL injury are often subtle and can be assessed by having the supine patient maximally flex their knee, bringing their heel as close as possible to their gluteal fold, if an effusion is present the distance separating the two land marks will be decreased and the flexion angle will be reduced (11, 14) by 10 to 20 degrees (normal is 130 degrees). Grading of injury has no correlation with MRI findings which appear as increased signaling of the PCL best seen in the sagittal plane. Complete rupture of the PCL differs from partial tears on MRI as there is loss of continuity of the ligamentous structure.
