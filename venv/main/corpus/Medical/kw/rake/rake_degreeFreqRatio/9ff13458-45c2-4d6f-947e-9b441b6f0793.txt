Bilateral optic nerve atrophy and papilledema
No chemotherapy or radiation therapy
• Large suprasellar mass with some small cystic foci
• Homogeneous enhancement.
• Marked hydrocephalus.
HYPOTHALAMIC GLIOMA
• Optic or Hypothalamic glioma (astrocytoma)
• Craniopharyngioma
• Teratoma
• Neuroblastoma
4 month old baby girl noted to be blind.
By some definitions, the lesion must present at < 60 days to be called "congenital".  However, considering the size, this tumor is almost certainly congenital.  Unfortunately there are no prenatal ultrasounds available for confirmation.
