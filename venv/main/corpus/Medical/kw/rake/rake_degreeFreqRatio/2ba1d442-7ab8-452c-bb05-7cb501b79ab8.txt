Texto: 
The man was in good health and took no medications.

Ocular Examination:
 - He was status post enucleation, right eye.
 - The left eye was blind and ‚Äúphthisical‚Äù.
 - There was a large, black and bloody mass measuring 15x15x5mm extending from the surface of the globe.
 - He was placed on antibiotics and given a tetanus booster and sent for a CT scan.
Surgery was planned for the next day: either an evisceration or an enucleation.

The patient underwent an evisceration. 
An acrylic implant was inserted into the scleral shell.
According to the ocular plastic surgeon who performed the surgery, there was no apparent extraocular involvement.
CT Scan:
 - The CT scan revealed an absent right eye.
 - On the left side there was  reasonably normal-sized eye and on the surface of the eye there was an irregular soft tissue prominence.
 - The globe itself contained calcification (bone) and  soft tissue.

Histopathology:
 - There was intraocular & extraocular tumor.
 - The tumor was composed of small and large, bizarre tumor cells  which had epithelioid cell features.
 - Many of the cells were pigmented and stained for melanin. There were areas containing many balloon cells.
 - The eviscerated intraocular contents also showed large areas of small and large epithelioid melanoma cells.
 - Fragments of bone and degenerated uveal tissue were present.

Immunopathology:
 - The following stains were positive: HMB-45, MEL IP and XIAP.
 - Stains for a variety of cytokeratins and EMA were negative.

Final Diagnosis:Melanoma , epithelioid cell type arising in the uveal tract.
Malignant Melanoma
A 76 y/o man presented with spontaneous bleeding from left eye for 3 days.
A black mass was present on the surface of the left eye for an unknown duration of time.  He had a foreign body sensation but no pain. 

His right eye was enucleated in 1970 following an automobile accident.
His left eye was severely injured in a fight in 1979 leaving him with no perception of light.  There was no recent history of ocular or facial trauma.
