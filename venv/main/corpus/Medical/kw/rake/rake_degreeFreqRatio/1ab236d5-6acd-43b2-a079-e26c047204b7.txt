Palpable lump in upper outer quadrant of left breast. Lab values are non-contributory
Bilateral mastectomies with chemotherapy
The breast tissues are heterogeneously dense bilaterally which decreases the sensitivity of mammography.  Multiple skin markers are seen on
both breasts overlying scars.

LEFT BREAST:  A 3 cm x 4 cm x 2.5 cm ovoid density is seen within the upper outer quadrant with ill-defined and obscured borders.  Monormorphic and pleomorphic 1-2 mm calcific densities are seen within and near this mass.  There is no radiographic evidence of skin
thickening or nipple retraction.

RIGHT BREAST: Architectural distortion is noted at the 12:00 position of the right with a a surrounding lucent
halo. There are some associated microcalcifications in the center of the area of architectural distortion. Spot views (not included secondary to poorly reproducible image) demonstrated persistence of the architectural distortion.
Infiltrating ductal carcinoma - left breast (surgical path confirmed)
Focal lobular carcinoma in situ - right breast (surgical path confirmed)
Right Breast Spiculated mass:                     Infiltrating ductal carcinoma
Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma
Radial scar
Biopsy scar

Left Breast Lobulated mass with irregular margins
Infiltrating duct carcinoma
Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma
Fibroadenoma
No reported history of hormone replacement therapy.  Noticed lump in left breast 2 months prior. On
physical examination, a mass was noted in the 3 o'clock to 12 o'clock position in the left breast.  The patient has history of breast biopsies bilaterally in 1976 and 1984.  The patient reports no first degree family history of breast cancer.
This patient was originally seen for evaluation of a lump in the left breast.  Upon further evaluation it was noted that a new area of architectural distortion was seen in the right breast.  Bilateral mastectomies were pursued.  Both the axillary nodal dissections were negative for malignancy.
