Afebrile and normotensive.  No tachycardia or tachnypnea.  White blood cell count within normal limits.
This young woman was known to have Sickle Cell Disease,  She will receive symptomatic treatment as needed.
The PA and lateral radiograph of the chest demonstrates adequate positioning of a left-sided chest port (the distal tip projects over the superior vena cava).  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, mass, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal contours and pulmonary vasculature are within normal limits.  There are concavities of the thoracic vertebral body endplates resulting in an "H-shape" or "Lincoln-log" appearance of the vertebral bodies on the lateral view.
