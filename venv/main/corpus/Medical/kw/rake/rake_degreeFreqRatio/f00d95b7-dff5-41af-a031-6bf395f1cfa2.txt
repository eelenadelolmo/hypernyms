Abdominal tenderness; + blood on FAST scan
Patient underwent medical therapy for disseminated Echinococcus
Abdominal radiographs demonstrate numerous rim-calcified lesions scattered throughout the abdomen with CT image demonstrating a rim-calcified lesion in the liver.
Disseminated Echinococcus multilocularis infection
Steatocystoma multiplex
Disseminated parasitic disease (Echinococcus)
Multiple calcified aneurysms (hemangiomatosis)
Injured in IED explosion; underwent exploratory laparotomy for hypotension
Somewhat dramatic example of disseminated parasitic infection on deployment; the topic discussion references a different case but contains key information.
