PE significant for valgus deformity of bilateral knees, right > left.
Labs significant for
 25 hydroxy vitamin D 9 (less than 20 considered abnormal)
 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3 20 (less than 27 abnormal)
 alkaline phosphate 2497 (normal range 38-126)
 PTH 404 (normal range 7-62)
The patient was given high dose vit D therapy with 600,000 IU vit D po in divided doses as an inpatient and then 400 IU vit D po qd.  The patient was given 1000 mg of calcium qd as hypocalcemia can be an adverse reaction of supplemental vit D.  Further follow up is unknown.
Please see image captions for specific findings in case submitted.  General findings include: demineralization, widening of the epiphyseal plates, metaphyseal cupping, irregularity and indistinctness of the provisional zone of calcification, poorly ossified epiphyses with indistinct borders, coarsened trabeculae, unsharp border of the inferior scapular angle and iliac crest, pathologic fractures, skeletal deformities.
Rickets (vitamin D dependent)
Abnormal vit D metabolism secondary to:
-vit D deficiency: malabsorption, inadequate dietary intake, inadequate sunlight
-hepatic origin: anticonvulsant therapy (increased hepatic metabolism), liver disease (failure of 25 hydroxylation)
-renal origin: vit D dependent rickets, parathyroid disorders (hypo, hyper, pseudohypo), maternal renal insufficiency as a cause of congenital rickets and secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Phosphate loss due to renal tubular disorders:
-vit D resistant rickets: X-linked hypophosphatemia
-Fanconi syndrome
-renal tubular acidosis
Tumor related
-hemangiomas of the bone or soft tissue
-metastatic neuroblastoma
Dietary calcium deficiency
4 yo female with inherited vitamin D-dependent rickets.  The patients mother has a documented history of rickets as well.  The patient was diagnosed at 30 months of age after presenting to her primary care MD with a right leg limp.  Orthopedic exam and subsequent radiographs and labs were consistent with vitamin D dependent rickets.  The patient was then begun on supplemental vit D.  However, the patient had poor compliance with the medication and follow up.  She now presented because her father was concerned she may need surgery for her worsening valgus deformity.
Per the patients record she had the diagnosis of hereditary vit D dependent rickets.  However, that may be a misdiagnosis as hereditary vit D dependent rickets is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder that typically presents as early as 3 months of age, in contrast to nutritional rickets, with most patients syptomatic by 1 year of age.  Furthermore, rachitic changes can be severe and rapidly progressive with pathologic fractures.  Hypocalcemia is the primary rachitic factor from decreased intestinal absorption and secondary hypoparathyroidism follows.  This patient does have hypoparathyroidism, as evident by her labs.
