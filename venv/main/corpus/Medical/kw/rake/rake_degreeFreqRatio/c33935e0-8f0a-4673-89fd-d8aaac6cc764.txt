None.
Layers of very hypointense T2 and GRE signal along outlining the cervical cord, pons, midbrain, and medial temporal lobes bilaterally.
Superficial Siderosis of the CNS Meninges
None.
64 year old male with known diagnosis and worsening cerebellar function.
Imaging characteristics in superficial siderosis is secondary to hemosiderin deposition along the leptomeninges.  This is caused by repeated subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage.  Clinical manifestations may include cerebellar dysfunction (as seen in this patient), pyramidal tract signs, and hearing loss.
