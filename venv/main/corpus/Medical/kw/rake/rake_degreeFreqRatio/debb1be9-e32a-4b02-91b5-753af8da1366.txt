Pain over right hip and with flexion and extension at the waist.
Treatment is primarily by surgical resection with radiotherapy and chemotherapy.   This patient is newly diagnosed and the specific treatment and followup plan has not yet been established.
On conventional radiographs this lesion is characteristically permeative with poorly defined margins, often lytic.  There may be periosteal new bone formation with an “onion skin” appearance.  CT and MRI clearly delineate the often very large soft tissue component, especially in the flat bones of the pelvis and thoracic cage.  Bone scintigraphy is useful for the early detection of bone metastases.  Metastatic lesions are seen in the lung, skeletal system, and lymph nodes and are present in 15-25% of children at presentation.
  MRI is valuable for assessing medullary extension and the soft-tissue component of the tumor.  The soft-tissue component of the tumor decreases after therapy, but the medullary abnormality remains.  Dynamic enhanced MRI has been used to assess tumor response.
Ewing sarcoma
Ewing sarcoma
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Osteosarcoma
Osteomyelitis
Metastatic neuroblastoma
13 yo female with right hip and pelvis pain.
This is a good example of the aggressiveness of Ewing sarcoma  as well as how large an associated soft tissue mass can be.  The imaging findings alone cannot diagnose Ewing sarcoma, but they do demonstrate a very aggressive process consistent with a malignant process.  Biopsy showed a Ewing sarcoma.
