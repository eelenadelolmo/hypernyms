Unremarkable.
Ultrasonographic and scintographic images consistent with agenesis of the left kidney.
Unilateral renal agenesis.
7 month old male for follow-up.
The ultrasound study was a follow-up study in an asymptomatic patient noted to have possible absent left kidney on prenatal ultrasound (images unavailable).  Since postnatal ultrasound was also performed with left kidney not visualized, a nuclear medicine study using Tc-99M-DTPA was performed to confirm that no functioning renal tissue was present other than the right kidney.  

Excretory urography will reveal an absent kidney and compensatory hypertrophy of the remaining kidney.  On plain radiograph, CT or MRI, the splenic flexure of the colon will occupy the region of the left renal fossa (with left renal agenesis); a similar finding showing the hepatic flexure positioned in the right renal fossa suggests congenital absence of the right kidney.  

In patients with anomalies of the internal genitalia, a radiologic investigation of the upper urinary tract should be performed, as it often reveals an absent kidney. An MRI is especially helpful in evaluating female patients for associated uterine abnormalities, among others. 

A relatively high incidence of contralateral reflux has been reported in patients with unilateral renal agenesis, and warrants either conventional (VCUG) or nuclear cystography.
