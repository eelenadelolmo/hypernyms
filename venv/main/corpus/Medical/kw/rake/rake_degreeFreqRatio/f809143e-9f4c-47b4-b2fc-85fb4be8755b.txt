Overweight jaundiced male with severe scleral icterus.  He has a distended abd with a palpable liver edge 4cm below the costal margin.  There is also shifting dullness to percussion.  Pt also has mild bilateral edema in the lower extremities.

Pt treated for alcohol withdrawal and watched closely for life threatening complications of portal hypertension.  He was given a Beta-blocker for control of BP in attempt to prevent rupture of gastric varices.  He was also placed on spironalactone for treatment of acites.  Liver nodule is awaiting biopsy and evaluation for removal will follow if malignancy is present.  The pts cirrhosis could mildly regress with alcohol cessation, but the only definitive treatment is a liver transplant, which he is not eligible for at this time due to his current alcohol use.  Pt will be placed in extended nursing facility for further evaluation, alcohol cessation, and observation of current portal hypertension.
Ultrasound: Liver is echogenic with coarsened architecture and fatty infiltrate.  There is a small mass in the left lobe.
Triple phase contrast CT: Acites along the liver and pericolic gutter bilateral.  Liver appears diffusely fatty.  Evidence of portal hypertension such as cannulated umbilical artery, and esophageal varices.  A hypoattenuated mass in the left lobe along the gallbladder fossa, which measures 6.1 x 4.5 cm.  The region has decreased uptake, which is consistent with focal fat deposit.
CT guided biopsy of liver revealed pt has  cirrhosis with corresponding portal hypertension.  The biopsy of the liver mass was consistent with focal fat deposit, but inconclusive, and will be re-biopsied for definitive diagnosis
With this patientâ€™s history, clinical findings, and radiographic images, the differential is alcoholic hepatitis versus cirrhosis.  Mass in the patientâ€™s liver highly likely to be a hepatocellular carcinoma, but has a differential diagnosis of malignancy to include metastatic disease, and cholangiocarcinoma.  A benign mass has the differential of a cyst, hemangioma, hepatic angioma, focal nodular hyperplasia, or an abcess.
49 y/o white male with a history of heavy EtOH use (3-4 hard dinks per day over past 35 years) complains of persistent bruising after two recent falls in which he did not lose consciousness.  Pt reports yellowing of his skin and eyes, and a bloated abdomen over past five days.  He has had several no bleeds in the past two days, and two black and tarry foul smelling stools.  No episodes of hemoptysis
This pt has a strong PMH and social history with regards to alcoholic liver disease.  His current episode could have been due to either an alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis.  Unfortunately his biopsy, lab values (increased PT, elevated alk phos), and jaundice all suggest that his alcoholic liver disease has progressed to cirrhosis.  Radiographic evaluation of a patient with cirrhosis begins with ultrasound, in which the liver may appear small and nodular.  Echogenicities on US may also reveal a fatty pattern to the liver.  A strong clinical history, lab values and US are sufficient to clinically diagnosis cirrhosis, but the gold standard for diagnosis is US.  A CT cannot diagnose cirrhosis, but can be used to evaluate for symptoms of portal hypertension, and to further investigate the presence of masses found on US as seen in this patient.  CT guided biopsy is also used to further evaluate liver masses in pt with cirrhosis.  The greatest risk for primary hepatocellular carcinoma is seen in pts with cirrhosis and viral hepatitis.
