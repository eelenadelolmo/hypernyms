No treatment indicated.
5.0 mm contiguous axial CT images of the chest demonstrated normal parenchyma without nodule, effusion or infiltrate.  Mild interstitial disease, left basilar fibronodular scarring and mild hyperinflation.  No mediastinal, hilar or axillary adenopathy.  Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.  Coronary artery calcifications.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
	Incidental finding of aberrant vessel seen lateral to the aortic arch on the left.  Following the vessel through many cuts demonstrated that the vessel was a left upper lobe pulmonary vein which drained into the left brachiocephalic.  There was no other venous abnormalities seen.
Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return
DDX:  PAPVR
      Persistent Left Sided Superior Vena Cava
64 y/o male smoker with history of interstitial changes and ?RLL nodule on CT from outside institution in 1999 (not available).  Referred for new chest CT to evaluate.
