Large intraperitoneal metal fragment adjacent to the aorta superiorly to the left renal arteries. Injury of the lower pole of the left kidney with large avulsion, devascularized splen, hematoma in the pancreatic tail. Intraperitoneal air and peritoneal fluid bilaterally in the gutters.
Perforating fragment
Young child struck by a metal fragment from an exploding bomb in his home. Case from a combat hospital.
Large Intraperitoneal metal fragment entered from the left lower back, traveled from posterior to anterior through the lower pole of the left kidney, through the splenic vasculature, through the pancreatic tail and resided adjacent to the aorta superiorly to the left renal arteries without penetrating the aorta. Intraperitoneal air and peritoneal fluid bilaterally with no evidence of major vascular extravasation.
