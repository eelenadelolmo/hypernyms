Unremarkable physical exam and laboratory findings.
The diaphragmatic defect was repaired surgically and the right kidney returned to a more anatomic location.

Retrospective review of the prenatal anatomic screen of the fetus fails to demonstrate a diaphragmatic abnormality and the kidney was intra abdominal.
Initial chest xrays failed to demonstrate any significant abnormality other than asymmetric thoracic expansion.  Later frontal radiograph of the chest shows a soft tissue density mass in the right hemithorax.  Contrast enhanced CT of the chest and upper abdomen reveals the right kidney in a suprahepatic location, within the right hemithorax.  Diaphragmatic covering of the right kidney could not be definitively identified at imaging but was thought to be present.
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia
Initial DDx based on plain film findings:
CCAM
Sequestration
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia

DDx after CT:
Intrathoracic ectopic kidney
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia
Newborn infant male born at 36 WGA with respiratory distress shortly after delivery.
An interesting coincidental finding in this patient was right-sided scimitar syndrome, which has an association with CDH.
