Papilledema
Radiation Therapy
• Enhancing mass in the posterior third ventricle
• Hydrocephalus of both lateral and 3rd ventricles
Papillary Epithelial Tumor of Pineal Region
• Choroid Plexus papilloma
• Germinoma
• Pineocytoma, Pineoblastoma
• Metastatic Disease
15 year old boy presents now with headache and diplopia.  
PMH of follicular carcinoma of the thyroid gland previously treated with radioactive iodine I131.
Pathology is quite distinct from the thyroid tumor. 
This makes diagnosis of metastatic disease highly unlikely.
