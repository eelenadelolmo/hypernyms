Tenderness in the proximal fifth metatarsal
Routine three views of the right foot with no prior studies for comparison demonstrate a complete transverse fracture through the base of the fifth metatarsal with approximately 4 mm lateral displacement of the proximal fragment with mild angulation.  In addition, there are two approximately 5 mm bony excrescences arising from the medial cortex, distal diaphysis of the fourth metacarpal. It demonstrates continuity with the underlying medullary bone, representing small osteochondromas.
