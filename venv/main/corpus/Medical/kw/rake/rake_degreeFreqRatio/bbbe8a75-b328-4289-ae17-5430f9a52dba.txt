Selective R and L internal carotid injections shows dilated anterior cerebral artery and early filling of anterior venous circulation.  L ICA also has bilobed opthalmic artery aneursym.  Venous phase of L ICA injection shows no filling of Superior Sagittal sinus which was partially obliterated during previous craniotomy.  L ECA injection shows filling of superior sagittal sinus by middle meningeal artery.  L ECA injection also shows retrograde flow through sinus with pathologic cortical venous drainage posteriorly i.e. cortical venous hypertension due to drainage of the fistula.
