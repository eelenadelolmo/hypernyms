General :  appear stated age, in mild distress

Musculoskeletal/Neurological:
Upper Extremity:
- Positive compression test ( pain radiating to left shoulder and arm with pressure apllied to top of head)
- unilateral left sided headache and neck pain with flexing or left sided rotation of neck.
-  Cervical ROM- flexion 45/0-45 deg, Extension 30/0-45 deg
-  Sensory;  numbness in left upper limb in medial and ulnar distribution, to a greater degree in the ulnar distribution.
-  Strength: 3/5 in left deltoid, 5/5 in right arm.
- Positive Tinel&#39;s sign left side (paresthesia in median nerve distribution)
- Positive Phalen&#39;s test on the left side.
-CN III-XII grossly intact, Neg Romberg.

Upper extremity electrodiagnostic studies:

-	Left sided denervation of C8/T1, ulnar innervated muscle
-	B/L median sensory neuropathy 
-	Left sided demyelinating ulnar neuropathy in the region of the elbow/cubital tunnel syndrome
Patient is being managed conservatively with pain medications, physical therapy and chiropractic manipulation ( ex. use of Cervical traction device) to mobilize segments, relax and strengthem musculoligamentous areas, and to decrease pressure at the intradiscal levels. 
   
Carpal tunnel syndrome was treated with cockup immobilizing brace and pain medications.  The patient has routine followup with a neurologist an her treating doctor of chiropractic so that the success of treatment interventions can be assessed.  Cortisone injection and/or Surgical intervention ( ex. Carpal tunnel release) may be a viable next option if conservative management fails.
( see topic for more detail on management)
Cervical T2W MRI: 

- Central C3-4 disc herniation (impinging on anterior aspect of the spinal cord)
- Left sided C5-6 disc herniation (radial nerve distribution)
- Minor bulge at C4-5.
- Broad central C6-7 disc herniation ( indenting the anterior thecal sac)
- No appreciable spinal stenosis.
Cervical disc herniation, Cubital tunnel syndrome, Cupal tunnel syndrone
Cervical Disc Herniation:

1. Cervical Myofascial pain ( trigger point)
2. Cervical sprain or strain
3. Traumatic Brachial plexopathy
4. Brachial Neuritis/Neurologic amyotrophy
5. Cervical spondylosis
6. Osteoarthritis
7. Rotator cuff disease.

Differential Diagnosis of  Cubital and Carpal tunnel syndrome: Includes first 5 from above and;

1. Over use injury
2. Compartment syndrome
3. Medial epicondylitis
4. Space occupying lesion/mass
5. Post-traumatic syringomyelia
6. Diabetic Neuropathy
Patient is a 45 y.o. woman with no past medical history who presents with unilateral left sided headache, bilateral neck and shoulder pain worse on the left, weakness and numbness in her left arm and fingers after being involve in a recent motor vehicle accident.

According to patient, she was a restrained driver when her vehicle was T-boned on the drivers side causing her to temporally lose  consciousness. She was transported to the hospital where imaging studies failed to reveal any acute fractures or dislocations. However, imaging did reveal cervical disc herniation. 
Patient has been treated conservatively with pain medications (NSAID and opiods), physical therapy and chiropractic manupulations.  She has not been able to work since accident.

Approximately 2 years the patient was involved in an initial MVA requiring surgery; left shoulder arthroscopy subacromial decompression, extensive debridement of glenoid labral tear and partial thickness rotator cuff tear with coracoidplasty. Her symptoms from that accident had improved until recent MVA.
MRI at the time of the MVA of 2 years ago, also showed cervical disc herniation.

This was an excellent case provided by contributor (SC), a chiropractor.  The complexity of this case provides a rich environment for differential diagnosis.  Here we have multiple areas of potential crush/compressive/irritative regions.  The physical examination revealed signs of radiating neuralgia consistent with radiculopathy, particularly on cervical compression testing.  Phalen&#39;s test helped evaluate for carpal tunnel syndrome through physiological median nerve compression.  Palpation about the cubital tunnel on the left side produced radiating neuralgia in the expected ulnar distribution.  As such, from a physical examination stand point there are three levels of involvement.  EMG evaluation did confirm cubital tunnel entrapment/neuropathy and CTS.  EMG did not confirm cervical radiculopathy.  However, it should be remembered that the sensitivity to radiculopathy on EMG is between 50% and 71%. [1]  The disc herniations present in the cervical spine can produce a double crush syndrome phenomena additive to the peripheral entrapment regions affecting levels that affect both the median and ulnar nerve components.   

Based on presentation, clinical exam, imaging and electrophysiological findings a diagnosis of Multiple crush syndrome was made.  Relative to her symptom picture and imaging she did have cervical disc herniation prior to the most recent MVA.  Such herniations are felt to be aggravated by the more recent MVA.  The symptoms and EMG findings regarding cubital tunnel and carpal tunnel syndrome are new, following the more recent MVA, and would be attributable to that episode.   Imaging studies must correlated with clinical and EMG findings to aid in the delineation of causal relationship.
