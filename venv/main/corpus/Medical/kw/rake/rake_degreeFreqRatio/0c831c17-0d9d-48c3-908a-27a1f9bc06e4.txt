On examination:  The patient had a stiff neck.  He was afebrile.  Intra oral examination showed a soft tissue swelling over the posterior pharyngeal wall extending up to the base of uvula.  The lower limit of the swelling could not be seen.  The swelling showed blanching on palpation with a tongue depressor.

Complete hemogram showed leucocytosis.  ESR was elevated.
His blood sugar was normal
Sputum for AFB was negative
Incision and drainage was done under local anaesthesia.  Patient was started on antibiotics and anti inflammatory drugs following which he showed dramatic recovery.
Xray soft tissue neck lateral view: showed 
Straightening of cervical spine (Ram rod spine) due to loss of normal cervical lordosis.
There was a prevertebral soft tissue shadow which extended from the level of C2 vertebra above, its lower extent could not be visualized in this view.
At the top of this shadow a air lucency was also seen.
Xray chest was normal
Retropharyngeal abscess
Retro pharyngeal abscess.
Tuberculous "cold" abscess
Pain in the throat of 3 weeks duration.  Pain increased gradually and got so bad that he is unable to swallow his saliva for the past 2 days.  He also gave history of low grade fever 3 weeks back which responded to drugs prescribed by local doctor.
This disease is common in children.  In adults retropharyngeal abscess is commonly tuberculous in etiology in India.  The habit of commonly prescribing antibiotics for trivial upper respiratory infections causes the retropharyngeal nodes to suppurate and lead to this condition.
Early recognition and management is a must because this may lead to fatal mediastinal infections.
Abscesses in this space could be caused by:
Aerobic organisms, such as beta-hemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus
Anaerobic organisms, such as species of Bacteroides and Veillonella
Gram-negative organisms, such as Haemophilus parainfluenzae.
Considering the imminent threat to the airway it is better to perform a tracheostomy even if there is mild respiratory embarrassment.
