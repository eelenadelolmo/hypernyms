Patient is in NAD, obese, dressed appropriately, and appearing stated age. Gait was grossly normal, with no shuffling or ataxia noted. Lumbar ROM is moderately diminished in all directions, with pain elicited with every motion. Cervical compression produced neck pain that radiates down right forearm. With the straight left leg raise, patient reported increased low back pain with radiation to left buttock. On the right, the patient reported similar low back pain with radiation to the RLE into the calf. Grip strength was markedly diminished with 30lbs of force in the left hand and 25lbs of force in the right. Pinch grip was also weak with right and left strength measuring 8lbs and 6lbs , respectively. Reverse Phalenâ€™s test was positive. Durkan gauge at 14-15 PSI over volar aspect of the right wrist produced tingling in the 1st-4th digits. Same findings in the left wrist. Durkan gauge at 12-13 PSI over the ulnar tunnel in the left arm produced tingling in the 4th and 5th digits. Deep tendon reflexes were evaluated in both upper and lower extremities. Biceps, triceps, and patellar tendon reflexes were 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflex was diminished on the left side, 1/4, while it was absent on the right side graded 0/4. Sensory evaluation with monofilaments was performed on both feet and both forearms. The left foot had normal sensation on both dorsal and plantar aspects (2.83mm and 3.61mm gauge, respectively). The right foot was noted to have some diminished light touch on the dorsum of the foot along L5-S1 distribution (3.61mm gauge). On the plantar surface, a 4.31mm gauge monofilament was needed to elicit a response along the plantar arch. This suggests diminished light touch in the right foot, without loss of protective sensation. In the left forearm, sensation was normal on the dorsal surface (2.83mm). Along the volar aspect there was diminished light touch appreciated along the distribution of the ulnar nerve (3.61mm needed for sensation). In the right forearm, the dorsum also had normal sensation (2.83mm), though sensation was markedly decreased on the volar aspect, requiring a 4.31mm gauge monofilament to elicit sensation. As such, it is concluded that there is diminished sensation to light touch on the volar surface of the left forearm along the distribution of the ulnar nerve and diminished protective sensation throughout the volar surface of the right forearm.

Sound-assisted soft-tissue mobilization was also performed on the patient with a greater audible crepitus noted in the right levator angulae scapulae and right upper trapezius musculature.

Patient received chiropractic manipulations to improve mobility and lessen pain associated with periarticular aspects of DISH. This treatment course includes tissue decompression, flexion distraction therapy, chiropractic manipulative therapy, and Quantum exercise to strengthen lower back and core muscles. We are also exploring alternative therapies such as gua sha as a possible way to relieve the patientâ€™s pain. We also referred the patient for EMG to assess carpal tunnel and ulnar neuropathy in the arms and to rule out possible radiculopathy in the spine. Durkan gauge testing made clinical confirmation of the EMG findings: moderate bilateral carpal tunnel and moderate to severe ulnar neuropathy in the left arm. There was no electrophysiological evidence of radiculopathy or brachial plexopathy.
CT scan revealed:
In the cervical spine: multilevel spondylosis and disc disease. 
Mild spondylosis and disc bulge at C3-4 
Central disc osteophyte at C4-5
Dorsal bony ridge and disc bulge at C5-6 
Mild spondylosis at C6-7. 

CT scan revealed:
In the thoracic spine: large bridging osteophytes from T5-T11, consistent with DISH. 

CT scan revealed:
In the lumbar spine: 
Mild posterior bulge with hypertrophy and ossification of the ligamentum flavum in L2-3, 
Prominent anterior spur at L3-4 with mild bilateral posterolateral bulges with some central spinal stenosis 
Posterior ridging ossification of disc herniation at L4-5, bilateral spondylosis of L5 with minimal anterolisthesis. 
There is also evidence of left SI join spurs with resulting ankylosis.


DJD was noted by CT scan in the cervical and lumbar spine. When reviewing all the imaging in concert, DISH-appearing osteophytes were appreciated in the lumbar spine. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis of the thoracic spine was also appreciated.

Patient is a 59 year old African American male with a past history of diabetes, HTN, cholesterol, and previous MVA who presented to our clinic in 2014 for evaluation on injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident in 2013. Patient was sitting in a parked car when he was backed into by another vehicle. There was no airbag deployment. Over the next several hours, the patient began experiencing neck and lower back pain, prompting him to visit the ED at BGH for examination. Radiographic imaging was obtained, and he was released on Lortab for pain. He then arrived at our clinic for chiropractic care. At this time, the patient reports persistent lumbosacral pain with radiation to the right posterior thigh, 8/10 in intensity, worse in the RLE. The pain is worse in the morning and improves as the day progresses. He states that movement exacerbates the pain while stretching and chiropractic manipulations help assuage the pain for a few days. In addition he complains of headaches, trouble sleeping, and parasthesias in both feet. He also reports some numbness and tingling in both hands following the most recent MVA. He denies any bowel or bladder dysfunction, fevers, chills, weight loss, or joint redness and effusions. 

He is currently on metformin, pravastatin, flexeril, and another BP medication that he cannot recall. He denies any past surgeries or allergies. He was in another MVA in 2005 with no long lasting repercussions. He is currently lives alone in an apartment and is unemployed from janitorial work, collecting disability for his recent injury. He smokes 6 cigarettes a day for the past 21 years, but denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. Family history is significant for cardiovascular disease in the mother and chronic renal failure in the father.

US assisted soft-tissue mobilization http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7HTgwnXXYs

Tenderness/stiffness  over muscle/ligament/bony areas paraspinally through palpation has been referred to when discussing concepts of spinal mobilization.   [1] [2] Immobilization of segmental portions of the spine either through the effects of trauma or perhaps as in this case by the effects of DISH may result in degenerative changes in the spine.  The concept of lack of posterior to anterior movement of the spine in the presence of a chiropractic subluxation/malalignment can be traced back to the founder of chiropractic D.D. Palmer. [3] In this case global ranges of motion were evaluated of the cervical and lumbar regions.  Loss of global ranges of motion can be affected by summative loss of intersegmental ranges of motion.  [4]  When an area of the spine becomes immobilized by whatever means such can then result in intersegmental degenerative change.  [ 5,  6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] .  Essentially to maintain normal segmental/periarticular health joint mobility is necessary [12].   In the case of DISH the lack of movement may then result in segmental degenerative changes along with two other factors felt to have an effect (age and trauma).  The soft tissue assisted methodology used in this case seeks to elicit an audible response over tissue associated with fibrosis/hypertonicity that might then be expected to accompany an area of hypomobility.  

We have attempted sound-assisted soft tissue mobilization (SASTM) on the patient in hopes of identifying detecting areas of soft tissue restrictions that could be treated with chiropractic manipulations and help relieve some of the patient&#39;s symptoms. 

As mentioned in the topic discussion, Eastern therapies such as Gua Sha, have shown promise in relieving neck and back pain and warrant investigation in patient&#39;s with DISH. 

Gua sha is a traditional healing technique, widely used in Asia and among Asian immigrant communities. It is generally used for conditions such as flu, cold, fever, heat stroke, respiratory issues, internal organ problems, and musculoskeletal problems (from fibromyalgia to severe muscle strain). 

Gua sha involves stroking the affected area with a lubricated smooth edge until ecchymoses (the Sha) appear. The echcymoses is a sign of extravascularization of capillary blood and is believed to relieve blood stasis and increase circulation to areas of injury. Other theories on the mechanism by which gua sha achieves its effect include direct effect on nociceptors and/or pain reduction through stimulation of serotonergic, noradrenergic, and opioid systems. Gua sha is a relatively safe procedure, with the most common complications being skin reactions to the lubricant being used and misdiagnosis of the sha by uninformed physicians as abuse or injury.
