No treatment is required if the patient is asymptomatic.  If the patient is symptomatic, nonoperative treatment using orthoses and physical therapy can be attempted.  If conservative management is unsuccessful, surgical excision can be performed.
MRI images show an accessory muscle posteromedial to the peroneus brevis and longus tendons and anterolateral to the Achilles tendon.  The signal characteristics are identical to muscle and tendon on all pulse sequences.
Accessory Peroneus Quartus Muscle
Soft tissue masses of the foot and ankle include ganglion cysts, hemangiomas, lipomas, nerve sheath tumors, plantar fibromatosis, soft tissue chondroma, giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath, synovial sarcoma, liposarcoma, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma.
The patient presents with repeated ankle injuries and pain over the lateral ankle.
The MRI appearance of this finding is diagnostic because its signal and appearance are identical to the other muscles on all pulse sequences.
