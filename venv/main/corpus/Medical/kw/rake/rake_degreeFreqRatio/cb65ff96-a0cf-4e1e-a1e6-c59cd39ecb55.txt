Papillodema. 
Ataxia
Surgery for resection.  Since a gross total resection was accomplished no radiation or chemotherapy is contemplated at this time.
CT: There is hydrocephalus of both lateral and the third ventricle.  There is a vermian mass overlying the fourth ventricle location.  This lesion is "cystic" (fluid-like) with some punctuate calcification seen on CT.  On the MR, there is some peripheral contrast enhancement of the mass.
Pilomyxoid Astrocytoma (PMA) WHO Grade 2
Pilocytic Astrocytoma (WHO Gr 1)
Hemangioblastoma (WHO Gr 1)
Pilomyxoid Astrocytoma (WHO Gr 2)
Medulloblastoma (WHO Gr 4)
13 y.o. girl developed headaches three weeks prior to admission.  She was treated at that time with medication for migraine headache.  One day before presentation she developed ataxia, nausea, and vomiting.
