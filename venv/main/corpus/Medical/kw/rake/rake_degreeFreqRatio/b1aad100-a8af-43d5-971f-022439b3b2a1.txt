A focal area of tissue thickening over the patient's left breast, 9 o'clock radial direction
A focused ultrasound examination demonstrates a breast mass which appears hypoechogenic, with shadowing, with ill-defined margins with suggestions of spiculation.  This was biopsied under ultrasound and was found to be infiltrating ductal carcinoma.

Another patient, demonstrating a hypoechoic lesion which appears taller than it is wide, with definite shadowing.  This was also biopsied, and found to be infiltrating ductal carcinoma.
