Texto: 
On cardiac exam patient was found to be tachycardic and had grade II-III/VI full length blowing systolic murmur near apex radiating to left axial and wide S2 split. 
Upper Extremities findings showed missing thumbs bilaterally, anomaly of left wrist, and shortened forearm with radial deviation and decreased DIP flexion in all finger joints.
Patient underwent cardiac surgery with repair of inlet VSD with patch closure and mitral valvuloplasty when she was 5-months old.
• Echocardiogram: left atrial dilation, patent foramen ovale, large inlet VSD, main pulmonary artery dilation and pulmonary arteries hypoplasia

• CXR: mild cardiomegaly, prominent vascular markings

• Upper extremity XR: Right radius slightly shortened than the ulna by  approximately 3 mm. The right hand shows 4 metacarpals and 4 digits with absent thumb. Left radius much shorter than ulna. Left radius and ulna mildly bowed in a volar and medial direction. The left had shows only 4 metacarpals and 4 digits with absent thumb. Left hand is deviated laterally and dorsally.

• EKG: left axis deviation, generalized flattening of T waves
Holt Oram Syndrome
• Heart-hand syndrome I (Holt-Oram syndrome)
• Heart-hand syndrome II (Tabatznik syndrome)
• Heart-hand syndrome III (brachydactyly with shortening of the middle phalanges)
• Duane-radial syndrome
• Acro-renal-ocular syndrome
• Ulnar-mammary syndrome
• Townes-Brocks syndrome
• Long thumb branchydactyly
• Phocomelia
She is a 3 year old girl.  PMH: 35 week twin gestation, born with a large inlet VSD, small ASD, and upper extremity deformities (missing thumbs bilaterally and shortened forearm). Pt developed worsening mitral valve insufficiency and congestive heart disease before 5 months of age.
Patient's surgery (repair of VSD and ASD) was successful but surgery was complicated by prolonged intubation, pulmonary hypertension and some degree of left ventricular dysfunction. Over the years she has developed right bundle bunch block, first degree AV block, mitral valve thickening, tricuspid valve insufficiency, hypertension, and gradual worsening congestive heart disease. She is currently on furosemide, digoxin, spironolactone and enalapril.  

She continues to have regular assessment by a cardiologist. Patient is also undergoing physical and occupational therapy to assist with self-help skills, compensatory grasping patterns and other motor skills.

Genetic counseling will be important for the patient’s family. Genetic testing and/or imaging studies (such as upper extremity x-ray, chest x-ray, EKG and echocardiogram) will be beneficial for patient’s siblings, especially her twin sister.
