Initial evaluation post MVA:
5’5” tall and weighs 210 lbs.  Blood pressure of the left arm in the seated position is 132/70mmHg.  

Active range of motion of the cervical spine revealed flexion to be performed 60°/50°, right rotation to 50°/80°, left rotation to 50°/80°, left and right lateral bending each to 20°/45° and extension to 0°/60°.  He reports neck pain during left and right lateral bending as well as extension.  He reported right neck pain during left rotation.  

The bicep and tricep reflexes were graded 2/4 bilaterally. Cervical distraction was unremarkable.  Cervical compression testing produced report of neck pain.  Active range of motion of the shoulders was within normal limits.  Muscle strengths of the upper extremities revealed a weakness of the right tricep and external rotators of the right shoulder.  Grip strength was tested using a Jamar dynamometer. The right hand tested to 25 lbs and the left hand to 25 lbs. He reports being right hand dominant. 

Postural evaluation revealed a low left hip and a low left shoulder.  Active range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine revealed flexion to be performed to 40o/90o with report of lower back pain.  Left and right lateral bending was accomplished on either side to 20o/25o with report of lower back pain. Extension was accomplished to 0o/25o with report of lower back pain.  The subpatellar and Achilles reflexes were graded 2/4 bilaterally.  He was unable to arise onto his toes in the static position.  He was able to arise onto his heels in the static position.  The figure 4 procedure was performed without a problem bilaterally.  Muscle strengths of the flexor and extensor halluces revealed a weakness of the left extensor and flexor hallucis to be graded 4/5.  The straight leg raise on the left side could be performed to 40o with report of lower back and left lower extremity pain extending to the foot.  The right straight leg raise could be performed to 30o with report of lower back and right lower extremity pain extending to the foot.  Relative to the right knee: The AP drawer and valgus/varus procedures did not reveal instability.  The McMurray procedure was positive both medially and laterally.  The patellar grind was positive 

Percussion and posterior to anterior compression of the spine produced report of pain over the cervicothoracic and lumbosacral regions.  Hypomobility was noted at the cervicothoracic and lumbosacral regions.  Muscle spasm was noted over the cervicothoracic and lumbosacral regions paraspinally. Pain/tenderness, asymmetry/misalignment, abnormal range of motion, and tissue/tone changes were associated with the areas of hypomobility.  

Exam at conclusion of Chiropractic treatment:

PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE TESTING: (Please see charts and graphs)
Computerized Range of Motion:  Cervical flexion 44 degrees/50 degrees, Extension 11 degrees/60 degrees, Right lateral bending 26 degrees/45 degrees, Left lateral bending 21 degrees/45 degrees, right rotation 69 degrees/80 degrees, and Left rotation 56 degrees/80 degrees.  On active range of motion of the cervical spine he reported no pain in the cervical spine.  On active range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine he reported no pain in the lower back.  Flexion 53 degrees/60 degrees, Extension 7 degrees/25 degrees, Right lateral bending 19 degrees/25 degrees and Left lateral bending 20 degrees/25 degrees.  When the straight leg raise was performed he did not report pain on either side.  Right straight leg raise to 89 degrees and Left straight leg raise to 87 degrees.   Computerized muscle testing demonstrated weakness of the following muscles: Right elbow flexors, right hip extensors, left shoulder abductors, right toe extensors and right toe flexors.  The patient was unable to perform Tandem walk.  He also demonstrated an inability to maintain balance in the Romberg test with the eyes closed. 

INDICES:  
He competed a Pain Disability Questionnaire and scored 92/150 with 53 in the functional area and 39 in the psychosocial area. 

He completed a Neck Disability Index Questionnaire and scored 42%.

He completed a Revised Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire and scored 54%. 

ALGOMETRY TESTING:

- The patient has no scheduled follow-up at this time, as he completed his 9 month chiropractic treatment and is pain free at this point. 
- The patient should consider close follow-up with his primary care physician if any further symptoms develop including pain, numbness, weakness or increased difficulty ambulating. 
- As the patient has severe spinal stenosis that could be worsened with any falls or acceleration/deceleration accidents, the patient should do his best to avoid any such situation.
MRI Cervical Spine: 
- At C2-C3 there is  small central disc herniation slightly indenting the thecal sac. 
- At C3-C4 there is advanced disc space narrowing and a spondylosis with end plate osteophytes. There is a dorsal osteophyte and moderate central disc herniation resulting in cord impingement. Both the ventral and dorsal subarachnoid space are effaced. There is moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis. 
- At C4-C5 there is advanced spondylosis and disc space narrowing with a dorsal bony ridge and moderate broad based central disc herniation with cord impingement. There is moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis. 
- At C5-C6 there is more advanced spondylosis and disc space narrowing with a dorsal osteophyte and disc herniation. There is retrolisthesis. This results in more severe spinal stenosis with cord compression. The ventral and dorsal subarachnoid space are effaced and the cord appears slightly flattened. There is severe bilateral foraminal stenosis. 
- At C6-C7 there is a moderate to large central disc herniation with cord impingement. There is increased signal within the cord from C5-C6 to C6-C7 indicating myelopathic changes secondary to cord compression. There is severe bilateral foraminal stenosis. 
- At C7-T1 there is no central stenosis, foraminal stenosis or disc bulge. 
- At T1-T3 there is increased signal within the cord that reaches fluid intensity signal and is consistent with a syrinx. The syrinx is 3.5 cm in length and 2 mm in maximal diameter. The cord is not enlarged.
Cervical Spinal stenosis producing Myelopathy
•       Cervical strain — Cervical strain is a nonspecific diagnosis, classically used to describe an injury to the cervical paraspinal muscles and ligaments with associated spasm of the cervical and upper back muscles. The diagnosis of cervical strain is reasonable in patients with acute axial neck and trapezius pain, where neurological dysfunction has been excluded.
•       Cervical facet syndrome — The zygapophyseal joint, commonly referred to as the facet joint, can cause axial pain and is probably the most common cause of whiplash-related neck pain and headaches. Historically, patients often have a history of trauma with an abrupt flexion-extension type injury, or an occupation which leads to repeatedly positioning the neck in extension.
•       Whiplash injury — The cervical  strain-sprain syndrome is caused by a traumatic event with an abrupt flexion/extension movement to the cervical spine. Symptoms of whiplash include severe pain, spasm, loss of range of motion in the neck, and occipital headache. Pain can be persistent with little identifiable abnormality seen on MRI, CT, x-ray, or bone scan imaging. Often multiple structures can be injured including soft tissues, spinal nerve, intervertebral disc, posterior longitudinal ligament, interspinous ligaments, alar ligaments, facet
joints, or other osseous structures.
•       Cervical radiculopathy — Cervical radiculopathy refers to dysfunction of the spinal nerve root that may manifest with pain, weakness, reflex changes, or sensory changes. Multiple conditions can give rise to cervical radiculopathy, including cervical foraminal
stenosis, cervical herniated disc, herpes zoster, Lyme radiculopathy, or diabetic polyradiculopathy, but degenerative changes in the spine are overwhelmingly more common than the other causes, accounting for
70 to 90 percent of cases.
•       Diabetic neuropathy — Diabetes mellitus can be associated with various neuropathic pain syndromes related to vasculitis of the vasa vasorum. Cervical and thoracic polyradiculopathy, plexopathy, and peripheral entrapments can be associated with neck, thoracic,
scapular, extremity pain and/or weakness.
•       Normal pressure hydrocephalus — Sharing clinical features of gait impairment and bladder dysfunction, normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) can superficially resemble cervical spondylotic myelopathy. However, in NPH, some degree of cognitive dysfunction is usually apparent, the gait disorder is usually apractic rather than spastic in quality, and urinary dysfunction is accompanied by an indifference representing its probable frontal lobe origin.
•       Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis — Both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cervical spondylotic myelopathy present in older adults. The neurologic examination in both disorders often demonstrates mixed upper and lower motor neuron deficits. With cervical spondylotic myelopathy, lower motor neuron deficits and fasciculations are isolated to the affected cervical myotomes, but in ALS they often appear in the legs and cranial muscles (eg, tongue) as well. Sensory deficits are not expected in ALS, but these are also often subtle or absent in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Electromyography is an important diagnostic aid in ALS.
•       Guillain-Barré syndrome — Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS) and cervical spondylotic myelopathy can both present as a subacute progressive paraparesis or quadriparesis. Patients with GBS typically have reduced or absent reflexes and may have cranial nerve involvement, while patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy usually have hyperreflexia and do not have cranial nerve involvement.
82-year-old AA man with a PMH of HTN, Type II DM, spinal cyst removal, arthritis, right knee surgery presents with posterior head pain, neck pain and lower back pain s/p an MVA in 2012. He reports he was the belted driver of a vehicle that was rear-ended.  He went to the hospital, was examined, imaged and subsequently discharged with pain medication. The patient presented to the office, the patient complained of intermittent headache, numbness in his distal upper and lower extremities, gait imbalance, and impotence. Patient denied associated nausea, photophobia or phonophobia. Patient also denies heart problems, breathing difficulty, dizziness, urinary symptoms, bowel or bladder incontinence.

Our discussion will focus on our 82 year old African American gentleman who presented s/p MVA with posterior head pain, neck pain, lower back pain, sensory abnormalities and gait imbalance. We are particularly interested in understanding the link between his cervical stenosis and his gait abnormality.  As described in the patient history, our patient was taken to the hospital s/p MVA where a CT and x-rays were obtained. Due to the patient’s continuing symptoms, he was sent for further imaging studies, which included a full spinal MRI. The MRI images were carefully examined and summarized in the imaging findings. It was found that there was multilevel spondylosis and disc disease resulting in segmental central spinal stenosis of the cervical spine, as well as multiple disc herniations causing cord compression. The Torg Ratio, an indicator of cervical canal stenosis determined by dividing the sagittal spinal canal diameter by the corresponding sagittal vertebral-body diameter, was also used to determine the presence of cervical spinal stenosis to identify if the patient was at risk of cervical spinal cord injury (3). It has been established in the medical literature that a ratio of less than 0.7 indicates significant spinal stenosis. Our patient was found to have severe spinal stenosis at multiple levels with an estimated Torg Ratio (TR) of 0.32. The effective TR at the level of C6-C7 was found to be 0.16, indicating distinct risk of quadraparesis with any further neck trauma. At the levels of stenosis the MRI was also found to have some increased cord signal reflective of myelomalacia, which is suggestive of myelopathy.
	Our patient’s imaging findings were then correlated with his history and physical exam findings to determine if the cervical spinal stenosis was symptomatic. As mentioned in our topic discussion, cervical stenosis develops when the spinal canal or foramen become narrowed leading to spinal cord and/or nerve compression.  Most cases of cervical stenosis develop over age 50 and result from aging or wear and tear on the spine. Many patients with cervical stenosis have a history of neck injury or trauma, which may have occurred months or years before the onset of stenosis symptoms, as in our patient (1).  Cervical spinal stenosis symptoms include neck pain; pain, weakness or numbness in the shoulders, arms and legs; hand clumsiness; gait and balance disturbances; burning sensations, tingling and pins and needles in the involved extremity; bladder and bowel problems; loss of function or paraplegia (1). In the case of our patient, he suffered from multiple stenosis symptoms found both on history and physical exam including, neck pain with movement, weakness and diminished sensation in upper and lower extremities, and significant gait and balance problems demonstrated by a positive Romberg test and difficulty ambulating without a walker. It has been found that if a patient’s stenosis is severe enough, or if it is positioned centrally in the spine, patients may present with signs and symptoms of myelopathy or spinal cord dysfunction. Typically, these patients present as our patient did with finger numbness, clumsiness, and difficulty walking due to spasticity and loss of proprioception, secondary to compression of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord. Balance during ambulation depends on afferent input from the visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive systems (5). Sensory ataxia results from a disruption anywhere along the afferent pathways. In patients with sensory ataxia, proprioception is lost, and patients become unaware of limb position. Strength is largely preserved. Patients stand and walk with their feet set widely apart, keeping their eyes on the ground. They are able to stand with their eyes open but become unstable when their eyes are closed (Romberg’s test) (5).
	Our patient also underwent a series of active range of motion exercises, which found decreased range of motion, pain/tenderness, asymmetry/misalignment and tissue tone changes of the cervical spine and lumbosacral spine upon flexion and extension. Additionally, the patient’s results on the Oswetry low back pain disability questionnaire, a questionnaire that assigns a functional disability score for pain and gait was 54%, indicating a distinct disability.  The patient also completed a pain disability questionnaire and a neck disability index questionnaire for assessment of ability to complete ADLs and scored 92/150 and 42% respectively, again indicating significant disability (4). 
	Following initial examination, it was decided that the patient was not a good candidate for surgical decompression given his age and additional comorbidities and he was enrolled in a nine-month chiropractic treatment. The chiropractic treatment involved three weekly sessions of chiropractic manipulative therapy, electrical muscle stimulation, flexion/distraction therapy, traction, and soft tissue manipulation to focus on improving mobility, increasing core strength and diminishing the patient’s level of pain. The patient progressed well and had a positive response to treatment. Upon completion of the nine months of treatment, the patient reported minimal head, neck or lower back pain. The patient was then subjected to computerized range of motion testing which found marked improvement in both mobility and pain with cervical and lumbosacral flexion and extension. However, despite impressive improvements with mobility and pain management, the patient’s gait is still a major problem and requires him to use a walker for more then 100 feet of ambulation. The patient’s gait is also having a direct impact on his ability to perform his activities of daily living and is impacting his quality of life.
