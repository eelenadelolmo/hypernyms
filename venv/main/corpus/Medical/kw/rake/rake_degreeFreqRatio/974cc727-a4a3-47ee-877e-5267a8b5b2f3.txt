Increased steroid dosing regiment.
CT examination from four months prior to the fluoroscopic study demonstrating an ill-definied soft tissue density within the left hemiabdomen adjacent to multiple loops of small bowel consistent with a phlegmon.  Additionally the superior aspect of the patient's remnant rectum is visualized.

Single contrast water-soluable (gastrograffin) enema was performed to assess for any fistulous connections between the rectal stump and the aformentioned phlegmon.  Fluoroscopic images demonstrate a thin column of contrast coursing superiorly and anteriorly into the left hemiabdomen into the region of the phlegmon.  There was no cutaneous extension of the contrast material.  No contrast material was present within the dependant regions of the abdomen to suggest free spillage into the abdomen.

67 year-old woman with long standing history of Crohn's disease and multiple prior abdominal surgeries who is status post colectomy with rectal stump and diverting ileostomy and complaints of rectal discharge over the past 2-3 months.
The patient tolerated the fluoroscopic examination without any difficulty.  Water soluable contrast material was utilized  in case there was leakage into the peritoneum and in the event that she would require immediate surgical intervention.
