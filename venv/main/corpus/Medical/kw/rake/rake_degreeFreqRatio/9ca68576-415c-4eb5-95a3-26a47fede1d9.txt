RLQ tender to palpation
WBC 16k
The patient's ruptured appendix was removed laparoscopically.  The patient subsequently developed an abscess in the right lower quadrant, which prompted the repeat CT two weeks later.
Initial CT::  Ruptured appendix with a thickened wall, inflammation of the periappendiceal fat, free air adjacent to the appendix, and an 8mm by 4mm density in the lumen consistent with an appendicolith.  Prominent mesenteric lymph nodes adjacent to the ruptured appendix.

F/U CT:  Well-circumscribed fluid collection with an enhancing wall in the appendiceal fossa consistent with an abscess
Appendiceal Rupture
13 yo boy with several days of increasing right lower quadrant pain, now with fevers
It is unusual for ruptured appendices to be operated on acutely, especially laparoscopically.  It is not unexpected that the patient subsequently developed an abscess in the right lower quadrant two weeks later.
