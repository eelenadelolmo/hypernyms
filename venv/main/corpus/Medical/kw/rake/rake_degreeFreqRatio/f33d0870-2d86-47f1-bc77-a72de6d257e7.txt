Supportive
Multiple punctate signal lesions (infarcts) in all three cerebral vascular territories
Fat Embolism with cerebral infarction
â€¢ Cerebral Fat Embolism
â€¢ Hypotensive border-zone infarcts
â€¢ HT white matter changes (too young, not hypertensive)
â€¢ Demyelinating disease (MS, ADEM)
27 year old man in car crash sustained right femur and pelvic fractures.  Patient was awake and alert at scene of accident and complained of leg and hip pain.  CT scan of brain and spine done in the ER was normal.

36 hours after surgical repair patient was noted to have altered mental status.
Fat embolism should be considered in any case of severe or manipulated fracture and/or surgical manipulation of bones - especially long bones and pelvis.  PMID: 19825491

Some patients will improve without therapy - even after several weeks.  Prednisone therapy may have some effect in preventing or treating fat embolism syndrome.
