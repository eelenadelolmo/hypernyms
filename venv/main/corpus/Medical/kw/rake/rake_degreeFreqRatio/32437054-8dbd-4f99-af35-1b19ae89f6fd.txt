The first line of treatment is conservative measures. Shoe modification and change in activity are attempted.  If this fails, a period of immobilization (3-6 weeks) may be attempted using a short leg walking cast. Reportedly up to a third of patients respond to non-operative intervention.  If conservative treatment fails it is necessary to intervene surgically. Significant relief can be obtained by resection of the coalition. It is, however, necessary to place a layer of material in the space to avoid a recurrence.
Radiographs of the left ankle and foot demonstrate a ball-and-socket ankle joint and associated talonavicular coalition.
Talonavicular Coalition
Differential Diagnosis for ball-and-socket ankle joint:
congenital shortening of the lower limbs
coalition of tarsal bones
absent digital rays
aplasia or hypoplasia of the fibula
Chronic ankle pain.
