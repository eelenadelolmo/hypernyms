surgery followed by radiation therapy
â€¢ Mass appears to arise from the midbrain or tectal plate 
â€¢ Mass involves both thalami - infiltrating?
â€¢ Compresses third ventricle
â€¢ Homogeneous enhancement
Pineal Germinoma (seminoma), intracranial primary
â€¢ germinoma
â€¢ glioma
â€¢ pinealoma or pineoblastoma
â€¢ metastatic disease
â€¢ lymphoma
37 year old man with headaches for 2 months.  CT scan done at outside hospital revealed "brain tumor."
Spine imaging was performed and did not show and CSF spread.  LP as not performed because of concern for increased intracranial pressure.
