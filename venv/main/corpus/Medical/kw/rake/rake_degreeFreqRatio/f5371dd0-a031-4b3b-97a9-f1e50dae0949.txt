September, 2010 reveals left frontal lobe mass with mionimal peripheral enhancementand decrease blood volume on Perfusion MRI. 

January, 2011 shows new lesion in right frontal lobe with regression of left frontal lesion.

28 year old man presented in September, 20xx with acute onset of right sided hemiplegia.
MRI done in September, in Haifa, revealed a large complex mass in the left frontal lobe.  The mass was biopsied, and initially interpreted as a tumor.

Follow up MRI in October, resulted in reassessment of the original biopsy diagnosis.

January of the following year, MRI demonstrates regression of lesion in left frontal lobe with a new mass in the right frontal lobe.  

This case was provided courtesy of Dr. Azaria Simonovich, neuroradiologist at Rambam Hospital, in Haifa, Israel.
