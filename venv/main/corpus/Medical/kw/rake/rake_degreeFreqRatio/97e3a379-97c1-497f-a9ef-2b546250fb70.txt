Texto: 
A 1.0 x 1.0 cm erythematous, firm plaque without ulceration, crust, or scale was noted on the right medial calf.  No sporotrichoid spread.  No popliteal or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  No mucosal lesions.

Bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal cultures negative to date
At three week follow-up, the biopsy site was healing well.  
Treatment options were discussed with the patient, including excision, oral fluconazole, intralesional antimalarials, cryotherapy, and heat therapy versus no treatment given the self-limited nature of localized cutaneous disease.  As the patient was PCS‚Äôing in one week, he elected for no treatment/observation with close follow-up at his next base in Hawaii.
Punch biopsy of the right medial calf revealed a granulomatous dermatitis with organisms morphologically consistent with Leishmaniasis; special stains for fungal elements, acid-fast mycobacteria, and atypical mycobacterial were negative.
Cutaneous Leishmaniasis
A 25yo AD man, recently returned to the U.S. from deployment in Iraq, presented with a 3 month history of a non-healing lesion on his right calf.   He noted a ‚Äúpimple‚Äù like lesion on the right calf 3 months ago while he was embedded with the Iraqi forces.  He denied any insect bites, though did recall living in unsanitary conditions and exposure to contaminated water from the Euphrates River.  He had taken a course of cephalexin without resolution of his lesion.  He was on clarithromycin at the time of presentation.
Case presented by Joy Wu, Maj, USAF, MC, FS at the 2007 Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, San Antonio, TX.
