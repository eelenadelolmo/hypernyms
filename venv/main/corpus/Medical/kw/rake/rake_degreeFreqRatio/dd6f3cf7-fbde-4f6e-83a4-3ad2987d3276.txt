Texto: 
Positional vertigo, right-sided hearing loss, and decreased facial sensation in the ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular distributions of the right trigeminal nerve (CN V).
The patient underwent a trans-mastoid to suboccipital craniotomy for removal of the tumor.
Just anterior to the pons and posterior to the clivus is a lobulated soft tisue mass extending from the optic nerve superiorly to the just below the level of the craniocervical junction inferiorly.  There is posterior displacement of the brainstem and upper cervical spinal cord secondary to mass effect.  This is well seen on the sagittal T1W FLAIR image.

The mass is dark on T1W and bright on T2W images without enhancement.  The Diffusion-Weighted Image shows the mass to be bright.
Epidermoid Brain Tumor
Arachnoid Cyst
Completely Cystic Schwannoma
48-year old African American female with two-year history of minimal right hearing loss progressing to positional vertigo with recent decrease sensation right cranial nerve V1-3.
Epidermoids are nonneoplastic tumorlike lesions which can insinuate throughout the CSF cisterns and engulf adjacent vessels and nerves.  Although malignant degerneration does not take place, these lesions can reoccur following subtotal resection.

These tumors are classically located in the cerebellopontine angle cistern, which this case nicely illustrates.  

These lesions can be difficult to distinguish from arachnoid cysts.  However, epidermoids are bright on diffusion weighted images, whereas arachnoid cysts are dark.  Additionaly, epidermoids typically do not demonstrate enhancement.

These are the third most common CPA tumor after acoustic schwannomas and meningiomas.  Clinical symptoms are usually secondary to mass affect on adjacent posterior fossa structures.
