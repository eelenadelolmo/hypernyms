The patient proceeded to excision biopsy with final pathology again reported as Pleomorphic Adenoma.
CECT Neck:
1. No abnormality adjacent to trachea on right to match fullness visualized on CXR - likely represented Superior Vena Cava (not shown)

2. A well-circumscribed, 1.9 cm rounded lesion within the left parotid gland demonstrates low density centrally.

US with FNA:
1. A well-circumscribed 2.0 x 2.1 cm rounded heterogeneous echogenicity lesion within the left parotid gland demonstrates increased through transmission

2. Needle tip is shown within the lesion
