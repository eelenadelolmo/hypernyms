Grayscale transaxial and long sonographic views of the left testicle demonstrate a well defined hypoechogenic mass within the upper pole of the testicle.
Leydig Cell Tumor
Germ Cell tumor, leydig or sertoli cell tumor, lymphoma, leukemia, melanoma, infarct, hematoma, epidermal cyst, dilated rete testes, abscess, adrenal rest
35 year old male with a history of infertility was referred for ultrasound examination of the testis
An alpha-fetoprotein, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, and blood testosterone level probably were performed prior to resection of the testicle.  The history of infertility placed the diagnosis of Leydig cell tumor higher on the differential diagnosis.
