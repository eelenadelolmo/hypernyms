EOM exam shows a Left Trochlear nerve palsy.
This lesion was resected.  The surgeon was able to dissect the tumor free of the parent nerve - which looked \\"OK\\" prior to closing.

After the operation, the patient still has a Trochlear. However, they are optimistic that function may eventually return.
Enhancing 3 millimeter lesion in the ambient cistern on the left along the expected course of the left trochlear nerve
Schwannoma of trochlear nerve on left
