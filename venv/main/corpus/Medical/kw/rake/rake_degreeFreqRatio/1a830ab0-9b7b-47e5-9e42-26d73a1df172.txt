Remarkable physical exam findings include:
confusion and inability to give great details on medical history
no slurred speech, but speech was slow

left-sided facial droop around mouth
pupils round, equal, and active to light
intact extraocular muscles
normal heart rhythms
normal GI exam
4/5 strength in upper extremity; otherwise normal
slight weakness in left upper extremity compared to right 
Indescribable sensation in left upper extremity
Not applicable
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.

severe pericardial effusion that expands the retrosternal pericardial space. 

Aneurysmal dilatation of the thoracic aorta with the greatest axial dimension identified within the ascending aorta measuring approximately 5.4 cm.

The left atrium appears somewhat compressed. The left ventricular musculature appears somewhat hypertrophied.

There is mediastinal hematoma.
Cardiac Tamponade
Seizure
This 85 year old woman was admitted to the emergency department because of a seizure lasting about 5 minutes after which she had difficulty speaking and had some left-sided weakness.  In the ER, she went pulseless and went into respiratory arrest at which point no further treatment was pursued and the patient expired.

Past medical history includes cerebral vascular accident and hypertension. She had residual left-sided weakness from a previous CVA.
