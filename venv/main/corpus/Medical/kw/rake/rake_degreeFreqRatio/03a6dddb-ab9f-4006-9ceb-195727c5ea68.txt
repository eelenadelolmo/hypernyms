Appendectomy.
Arrowhead sign seen in the cecum at the appendiceal oriface. Enlarged appendix without free air or fluid.
Acute Appendicitis
Patient presented to the emergency department with several hours of abdominal pain.
Arrowhead sign is a secondary sign of appendicitis seen CT imaging. The arrowhead sign results when oral/rectal contrast material collects in the upper part of the cecum near the appendiceal orifice. The sign is formed by the extension of inflammation from the appendix into the cecum.
