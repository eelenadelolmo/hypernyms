None. Incidental, benign finding.
Diffuse tiny bone islands involving the sacrum, iliac, ischial, pubic bones and femoral heads bilaterally.
OSTEOPOIKILOSIS
Sclerosing Bone Dysplasias
Metastatic disease (however it would be highly rare for metastatic disease to be bilateral, symmetric, and in typical locations for osteopoikolosis)
Noncontributory.
