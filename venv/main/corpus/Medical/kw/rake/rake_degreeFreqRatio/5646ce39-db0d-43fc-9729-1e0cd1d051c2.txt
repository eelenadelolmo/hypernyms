Noncontrast Axial images of the brain demonstrate significant vasogenic edema with effacement of the sulci in the right parietal and posterior frontal white matter.  Concern was for underlying neoplasm.

MRI images demonstrate motion artifact on several sequences.  An irregular 2x1.5 cm contrast enhancing lesion in the right parietal lobe adjacent to the posterior falx with a broad base which extends into the medial right parietal lobe with indistinct margins.  Extensive vasogenic edema is present in the surrounding white matter with sulcal effacement and mass effect on the posterior horn of the right lateral ventricle.

MR spectroscopy performed in a single voxel was limited by motion but demonstrates a significant decrease in NAA and slight choline peak elevation.  No lactate peak was present.
Neoplastic disease
• Infection
• Metastatic lesion
• Lymphoma
• Meningioma
• Primary neoplasm (Glioblastoma Multiforme)
75 year old man with new onset of left lower extremity weakness and recent back surgery.  Patient has no known primary neoplastic disease.
Patient is pending definite diagnosis however it is suspected that he has a primary lung neoplasm.  Noncontrast CT is important in initial evaluation of neurological deficits.  However, MRI was necessary to characterize the underlying lesion.  The study was limited secondary to artifact which limited definite evaluation of whether this was intraaxial or extraaxial however it shared characteristics of both lesions.  MR spectroscopy aided in narrowing a broad differential by the decrease in NAA and elevation of CHO to suggest neoplastic disease.
