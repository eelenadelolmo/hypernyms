Texto: 
The sagittal image (Film 1, scan 1) shows a linear area of hypointensity extending from the lateral ventricle to a cortical sulcus.  There is a dimple in the superior aspect of the ventricle at the location of the linear lucency.  The axial T2-weighted images (Film 1, scans 2-6) show a linear area that is isointense to gray matter extending medially from the posterior Sylvian region all the way to the wall of the lateral ventricle.  (See additional coronal (Films 2 and 4) and axial (Films 3 and 5) images.)  There is a small outward dimple of the ventricle where it meets the gray matter.  The cerebral cortex adjacent to and along this gray matter is disorganized in its appearance.  The adjacent cortex is slightly thickened with an irregular margin at the cortical- white matter junction.  The findings of a gray matter lined cleft extending through the entire hemisphere into the lateral ventricle is diagnostic of schizencephaly.
Schizencephaly (unilateral, closed lip)
Seizures
The term schizencephaly describes gray matter lined clefts that extend through the entire hemisphere from the lateral ventricle to the inner table of the skull.  The clefts can be unilateral or bilateral and can be located anywhere within the brain.  The walls of the clefts may be fused or separated.  When the walls are fused (closed lip schizencephaly) the walls appose one another directly, obliterating the CSF space within the cleft at that point.  When the walls are separated (open lip schizencephaly), CSF fills the cleft all the way from the lateral ventricle to the subarachnoid spaces surrounding the hemispheres.

Clinically, the severity of the patient's symptoms depends upon the amount of involved brain.  Those patients with the single cleft with fused lips generally have a seizure disorder and a mild neurological deficit, if any.  Patients with unilateral open lip schizencephaly tend to show a mild to moderate developmental delay depending on the location of the cleft within the hemisphere.  The neurological deficits are usually significant.  Patients with bilateral clefts are severely retarded with seizure disorders from a very early age.

Open lip and bilateral schizencephalies are included in the folder along with the unilateral fused lip schizencephaly that was the unknown case on this topic.  In all of these cases, one can see full thickness clefts running through the hemisphere with irregular margins in the pathognomonic gray matter lining the cleft.  The gyral pattern of the adjacent cortex is abnormal.  Gray matter heterotopias line the ventricle adjacent to the cleft on both the open lip schizencephaly and the bilateral schizencephaly.  Notice that the septum pellucidum is absent in both of the severe cases of schizencephaly.  Approximately 80% of patients with schizencephaly will have absence of the septum pellucidum.
