Texto: 
Both patients presented with decreased breath sounds bilaterally.
The Patient with Cystic Fibrosis recieved a PICC line and was started on long-term antibiotic therapy. At the time of this writing, the patient was 5 days post-PICC placement with improving respiratory symptoms.

Treatment for post-operative atelectasis involves improving "pulmonary toilet", including early ambulation and incentive spirometry.
The Patient with Cystic Fibrosis has multiple findings to include trams-tracking and signet rings. 

The Post-Operative patient with atelectasis shows a complete air bronchogram in the left lower lung field due and a smaller air bronchogram in the right lower lung field. There is overall increased density of both lower lung fields.
Cystic Fibrosis with Tram Tracking and Atelectasis with Air Bronchograms.
Tram Tracks can appear in cases of COPD, Asthma, and from any cause of bronchiectasis, such as:
â€¢Cystic Fibrosis
â€¢Kartagener's Syndrome
â€¢Pulmonary Fibrosis
â€¢Chronic or Necrotizing Bronchitis

The differential for air bronchograms is extensive, relating to the long list of causes of Consolidation, Atelectasis, and Interstitial Thickening:
â€¢Consolidation
 Â»Embolism, Contusion
 Â»Pneumonia, ARDS, Congestion
 Â»Mucous plugging, Alveolar Proteinosis
 Â»Alveolar Cell Carcinoma, Lymphoma
â€¢Atelectasis
 Â»Obstructive, Compressive, Adhesive, Cicatrization
â€¢Interstitial Thickening
 Â»Inflammation, Edema, Fibrosis, Malignant Lymphangitic Spread, Granuloma, Pneumoconiosis.
Patient as known, long-standing cystic fibrosis and was admitted to the inpatient ward with 3 days of productive cough.

This patient's images are compared to a 53 year old female with post-operative bilateral atelectasis.
The recognition and differentiation of air bronchograms and tram tracks is an often confusing and misunderstood topic. As they lead to very different differential diagnoses, it should be a well developed skill. These two sample patients show fairly distinct examples of both. Likewise, the experimental analog presented shows what could  be considered distinct examples of the properties and radiographic findings of these two processes.
