Not available as patient was referred from outside facility.
None required.
â€¢ High signal intensity lesions in basal ganglia and pons (seen on T2 only)
â€¢ No mass effect or enhancement of these lesions.
Neurofibromatosis Type 1
â€¢ Myelin vacuolization
â€¢ Hamartomas
â€¢ Gliomas (Astrocytomas)
â€¢ Ectopia
11 year old boy with a known clinical diagnosis,  for evaluation of daily headaches.
This boy had a known diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis Type 1.

There are no intracranial masses (e.g. optic nerve or hypothalamic gliomas) found in this patient.
