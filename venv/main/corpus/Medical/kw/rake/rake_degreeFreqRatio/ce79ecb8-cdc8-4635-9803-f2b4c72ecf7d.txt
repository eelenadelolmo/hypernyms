Langerhan Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) is a group of disorders characterized by proliferaton of immature Langerhans cells.  In addition, there are eosinophils and often multinucleated giant cells - hence the old term "eosinophilic granuloma" (EG).  Macrophages and lymphocytes may also be present.

Other syndromic names include: Histiocytosis X, Letterer-Siwe disease, and Hand-Schuller-Christian disease. 

For more on the diagnostic evaluation of LCH - visit the NCI website:
