Conservative treatment with physical therapy and passive range of motion exercises is the first performed.  A small percentage of patients will have persistent symptoms in which distention arthrography leading to capsular rupture, manipulation under anesthesia, or arthroscopic capsular release may be attempted.
Coronal T2 weighted images show joint capsule and synovial thickening at the level of the axillary recess that is greater than 4 mm in max diameter.
Adhesive Capsulitis
Rotator cuff disease
Biceps tendinopathy or tear
Cervical disc disease
Arthritis
Labral pathology
Thoracic outlet syndrome
The patient has pain and restricted range of motion in her left shoulder.  She has a past medical history of diabetes.
This patient is a female and diabetic.  Adhesive capsulitis affects women more frequently than men.  Diabetes mellitus is also a very common predisposing factor.  Trauma, cervical disk disease, imobilization, and hemiplegia are other common predisposing factors.
