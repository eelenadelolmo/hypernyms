Axial CT images from HRCT demonstrate bilateral predominantly lower lung zone bronchiectasis. Images demonstrate the classic "signet ring" sign with enlarged bronchi adjacent to relatively smaller caliber of pulmonary arteries. No fissural thickening or nodularity appreciated.  No evidence of ground glass opacity or air trapping. No air-filled cystic abnormalities.
