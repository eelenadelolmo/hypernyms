Abnormal EEG with right parietal spikes.
CSF positive for tau protein and for 14-3-3 protein (thought to be indicative of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease)
supportive
• Elevated signal in left caudate head, putamen, and right parietal cortex on both T2 and FLAIR sequences
• Abnormal DWI and ADC map in same locations
• No pathologic enhancement following contrast injection
Spongioform Encephalopathy,  presumed variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
• Infarction
• Post-ictal state
• Encephalitis
• Migraine
