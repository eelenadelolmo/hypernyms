Mild heterogeneous sclerosis is seen within the metaphysis of the left femur on the AP projection.  The frog-leg lateral projection demonstrates abnormal inferior rotation of the epiphysis relative to the metaphysis.  The final image demonstrates a common treatment for SCFE, a surgically placed pin.
SCFE - Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis
The findings in this case are classic for slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE).
