Texto: 
Single AP radiograph of the left hand.  There is subperiosteal resportion of cortical bone at the radial aspect of the second, third, fourth, and fifth ray middle phalanges.

Per the standards of Greulich and Pyle, the patient's chronological and bone ages were congruent.
Renal Osteodystrophy
Subperiosteal bone resorption due to hyperparathyroidism is commonly found on the radial side of middle and distal phalanges. These are part of the spectrum of radiographic abnormalities associated with chronic renal insufficiency, known as renal osteodystrophy.
17 yo boy on dialysis for end-stage renal disease. The patient is asymptomatic, the clinician referred him for a  hand radiograph to evaluate his bone age.
