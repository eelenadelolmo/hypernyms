Mid-epigastic abdominal tenderness.
The portion of the replaced right hepatic artery involving in the tumor was resected and the artery transplanted to arise from the distal aorta by means of a venous graft.
CT evaluation demonstrates a mass arising in the head of the pancreas. Incidental note was made of a vessel passing along the mass and through the portal-caval space with branches feeding the right hepatic lobe. Angiogram confirmed the presence of a replaced right hepatic artery.
