Febrile to 102. Alert, no apparent distress.
Frontal radiograph shows subtle air-fluid level in largely opacified left hemithorax. Lateral pleural thickening is apparent.
Pneumonia with left lower lobe abcess/necrosis and empyema.
Lung abscess or necrosis
Sequestration or infected bronchogenic cyst 
Bronchiectasis with fluid accumulation
Cavitary neoplasm
4 month female with worsening fever
Drainage of the abscess can be preformed but has as a high risk of causing the complication broncho-pleural fistula, which is very difficult to treat. Furthermore drainage of small pulmonary abscesses in young children who are clinically not in extremis is usually not necessary. These generally resolve with intravenous followed by oral antibiotic therapy. On the otherhand, drainage of the empyema is necessary as antibiotics will have no effect on the empyema
