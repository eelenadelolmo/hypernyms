The prognosis of babies born with VACTERL syndromes is dependent upon the severity of the anomalies. The survival of babies with VACTER association has gradually increased with better management of anomalies.  At birth, babies with urinary tract abnormalities should started on antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infection while awaiting completion of screening.  Surgeons are more likely to repair cardiac and intestinal tract anomalies shortly after birth.
• CT abdomen: Hypertrophic lt kidney with signs of dilution of renal collection systems.  Rt Kidney absent.

• Bone scan: Hypoplasia of ribs bilaterally. Rt. Kidney not observed. 

• Cx Spine: s/p Harrington Rods from C4 to T2. Mild cervical Levo scoliosis observed.  Fusion of vertebral bodies C6-T2. Blalock-Taussig graft is noted in lower region of image
VACTERL Syndrome
Townes Syndrome, trisomy 18, trisomy 13, Caudal regression syndrome, renal agenesis, electrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia syndrome, and Holt-Oram syndrome
This is a 11 y.o. boy with persistent neck and upper back pain for the past year.  Spinal surgery to correct scoliosis of T1-T7 done two years ago.
The interesting findings about this patient is that he is an older VACTER syndrome patient and  he has had very few complications from his anomalies.  The patient in active in many sports and occasionally wears a soft collar when he experiences cervical discomfort.
