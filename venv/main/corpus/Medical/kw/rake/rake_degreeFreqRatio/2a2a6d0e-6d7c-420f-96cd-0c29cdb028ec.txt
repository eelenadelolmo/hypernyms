Texto: 
Closed reduction followed by plaster immobilization.
Transverse fracture extending from the volar to the dorsal surface of the distal portion of the radius, accompanied by impaction, and marked dorsal angulation and dorsal displacement of the distal radius, without intra-articular involvement.   The radius is foreshortened secondary to bayonnet-type displacement.  No ulnar styloid process fracture is identified.
Collesâ€™ Fracture: Frykman Classification I
53 yo female s/p fall on outstretched hand with pain in her wrist and forearm.
