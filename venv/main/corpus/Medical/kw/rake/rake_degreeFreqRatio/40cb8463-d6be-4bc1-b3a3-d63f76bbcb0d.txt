Texto: 
Minimal epigastic tenderness to palpation. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Basic laboratory values, including blood glucose level and WBC count, are within normal limits. The patient reported a history of a recent negative PPD.
Â» The patient's abdominal pain was attributed to a gastroenteritis and resolved within 24 hours of presentation.

Â» Calcification of the vas deferens, in this case related to degenerative change of aging.
An acute abdominal series is negative for evidence of bowel obstruction. Incidentally noted on the supine abdominal radiograph is a serpiginous, calcified structure overlying the pelvis and showing the expected morphology of the vas deferens.
