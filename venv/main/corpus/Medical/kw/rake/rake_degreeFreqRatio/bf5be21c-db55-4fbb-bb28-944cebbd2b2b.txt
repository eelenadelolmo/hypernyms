Patient is unlikely to improve with continued chemotherapy and/or radition therapy.  Hospice care with symptomatic therapy is recommended.
Chest and abdominal CT on 13 April 2006 revealed the following in comparison with an August 2004 chest and abdominal CT:
  â€¢ Progression of right hilar adenopathy and enlargement of the pleural-based soft tissue mass along the posteromedial aspect of the right lower lobe.
  â€¢ Pulmonary parenchyma demonstrates enlargement of multiple
right lower lobe pulmonary nodules.
  â€¢  The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are normal. 
  â€¢  Soft tissue in the bilateral gluteal regions are normal.

Chest and abdomal CT on 16 August 2006 after 4 months of chemotherapy and radiation revealed the following in comparison with the 13 April 2006 study:
  â€¢  Subcarinal lymphadenopathy is demonstrated and increased from previous study.
  â€¢  Associated rib destruction is demonstrated.
  â€¢  Associated endobronchial narrowing is demonstrated extending to the right lower lobe.
  â€¢  No pulmonary nodules are seen in the left lung.
  â€¢  Interval development of bilateral adrenal masses.
  â€¢  Soft tissue masses are demonstrated within the mesentery.
  â€¢  Interval development of right gluteal mass

Chief complaint:

47 y/o male presented in Nov 2005 with pain in right anterior thigh.  X-ray revealed a mass in the femur and adjacent soft tissue.  Partial surgical resection of mass revealed adenocarcinoma.  Subsequent PET scan indicated increased uptake at several locations in the right lung.

Patient had a history of pulmonary nodules dating to 2003/2004.  However a PET conducted in August of 2004 was negative except for minimal uptake in one pulmonary nodule.  Serial X-rays showed no changes in these nodules through mid 2005.

Patient was diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the right lung and referred to oncology for radiation and chemotherapy.
