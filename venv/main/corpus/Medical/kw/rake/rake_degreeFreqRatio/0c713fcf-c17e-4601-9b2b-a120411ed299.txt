The right paratracheal stripe is usually 2mm wide, but may be up to 5mm wide.  An enlarged paratracheal stripe (>5mm) is an important marker for otherwise subtle adenopathy, as well as tracheal tumor, mediastinal inflammation or hemorrhage, pleural thickening or pleural effusion.  The margins of the paratracheal stripe are: 
1. distal endâ€”formed by the azygous vein
2. medial marginâ€”the air-soft tissue interface along the right mucosal surface of the trachea
3. outer marginâ€”begins around the medial end of the clavicle and is formed by the RUL plural surface
The stripe ends where the RUL bronchus goes under the azygous vein as it arches anteriorly to empty into the SVC.
The malignant lymphomas are divided into Hodgkinâ€™s and non-Hodgkinâ€™s groups.  Sir Thomas Hodgkin was the first to describe Hodgkinâ€™s disease in 1932.  Hodgkinâ€™s can present at any age, but it is more prevalent among adolescents and young adults.  It typically presents as painless, rubbery lymphadenopathy involving the superficial lymph node groups.  Cervical nodes are involved nearly 70% of the time.  Approximately half of patients also have splenomegaly.  Mediastinal involvement occurs in approximately 10% of patients, and mediastinal involvement is characteristic of the Nodular Sclerosing type (as in this patient).  Cutaneous involvement can occur and is usually a late complication.  Patients may also present with constitutional symptoms (night sweats, pruritis, fatigue, weight loss, etc) with widespread disease.  
The diagnosis of Hodgkinâ€™s disease is made by lymph node biopsy (as was done in this patient).  There are 4 histological types:
1.	Nodular Sclerosing (>50%, most common; worst prognosis)
2.	Mixed cellularity (25%)
3.	Lymphocyte predominant (5%; best prognosis)
4.	Lymphocyte depleted (5%)
Staging of Hodgkinâ€™s disease is made by the use of CXR, BM biopsy, and CT imaging.  There are 4 stages:
1.	Stage Iâ€”confined to one lymph node group (90% 5-yr survival rate)
2.	Stage IIâ€”confined to 2 or more lymph node groups on one side of the diaphragm
3.	Stage IIIâ€”involving nodes on both sides of the diaphragm
4.	Stage IVâ€”Extra-nodal disease (60% 5-yr survival rate) 
Treatment involves radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy.  Patients with Stage I or Stage II Hodgkinâ€™s disease are usually treated by radiation therapy, while Stage III & IV disease is usually treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
