She had an absent gag reflex. She was hyperreflexic throughout the left side, had a positive Hoffman's sign, and clonus in the left lower extremity.  She had a left hemiparesis. There was bilateral upgaze and downgaze paresis.  She presented in a wheelchair and had an antalgic gait.
The patient underwent endoscopic third ventriculostomy and cyst fenestration to relieve her hydrocephalus. The patient did well postoperatively but contracted meningitis approximately one month following surgery. At that time, the shunt was removed and the patient was discharged home. The patient appeared to improve clinically over a period of three years, but then started to deteriorate. At that time the patient underwent placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt and experienced significant improvement in her symptoms.
There are multiple septated cystic lesions in the midbrain and pons.  These lesions do not enhance and are isointense to CSF on all pulse sequences.  There is mass effect with compression of the third ventricle.  There is enlargement of the lateral ventricles consistent with obstructive hydrocephalus.
Giant Tumefactive Perivascular Spaces
â€¢ Giant Tumefactive Perivascular Spaces
â€¢ Benign cystic neoplasm
â€¢ Neuroepithelial (ependymal) cysts
â€¢ Neuroglial cysts
â€¢ Old lacunar infarcts
â€¢ Neurocysticercosis
â€¢ Cryptococcosis
â€¢ Mucopolysaccharidoses
A 47 year-old woman presented with headache, left hemiparesis, paresthesia, diplopia, and dizziness.  She also reported difficulty with bladder control in the past year and difficulty swallowing.
Giant and/or tumefactive perivascular spaces are usually asymptomatic - thus helping to distinguish this lesion from others in the differential diagnosis.  This case illustrates one way that they may become symptomatic - by obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius.  Similar cases have been reported in the literature.
