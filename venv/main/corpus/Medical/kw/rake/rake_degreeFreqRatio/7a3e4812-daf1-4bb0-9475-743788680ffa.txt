50 year old man with chronic back pain that has become much worse over past week.
Due to the severe congenital spinal stenosis it was difficult to determine if the mass was intra-dural or extra-dural.  The only lumbar disk of relatively normal height was at L4-5 - making a herniation at that level somewhat unlikely.
The patient was returned to MRI for a contrast enhanced scan which failed to demonstrate enhancement, thus helping to make the pre-operative diagnosis of HNP (herniated nucleus pulposis).
