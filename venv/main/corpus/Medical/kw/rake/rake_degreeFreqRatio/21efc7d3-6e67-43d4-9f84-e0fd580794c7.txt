Firm distension of upper abdomen.
Surgical removal
Frontal abdominal radiographs demonstrated a well formed calcification in the left upper quadrant.  A follow up CT scan revealed a 23x16x27cm cystic mass in the abdomen containing a focus of calcification and adjacent fat.  The mass appeared to arise from the right ovary, ascending from the pelvis and pulling the right broad ligament, in turn causing rightward deviation of the uterus.  A smaller left ovarian teratoma, measuring 4.0x3.7cm was seen to contain a larger fat content.  All other abdominopelvic organs were displaced, but normal.
Mature Cystic Teratoma
Dermoid, cystadenocarcinoma, abscess, endometriosis, any germ cell or other ovarian solid or cystic tumor.
18 y.o. girl with distension of abdomen for 3 years, abdominal discomfort and reflux symptoms for 1-2 years.
Frontal abdominal radiographs were initially obtained which revealed a well-formed calcification overlying the left psoas stripe adjacent to L3.  A subsequent CT scan was obtained which revealed bilateral mature cystic teratomas arising from both of the ovaries.
