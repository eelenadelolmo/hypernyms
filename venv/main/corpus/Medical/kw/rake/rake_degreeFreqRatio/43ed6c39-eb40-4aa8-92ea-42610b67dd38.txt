Texto: 
Positive lateral joint line tenderness. Positive swelling of left knee.
Arthroscopy was performed on the patient for surgical repair of his meniscal tear. Follow up includes a rehabilitation program with the use of a brace and limited motion initially. Full range of motion can be expected within 3-4 months after the surgery was performed.
Axial T2 weighted fat saturated cut through the knee joint:
   â€¢Cleft sign of free edge of lateral meniscus.
Sagittal oblique T1 cut of lateral knee:
   â€¢Ghosting of anterior horn of lateral meniscus. Also        
    with noted loss of bow tie appearance of the   
    menisci.
Sagittal PD cut of lateral knee:
   â€¢Ghosting of free edge of lateral meniscus with 
    increased signal. 
Sagittal PD cut through lateral knee:
   â€¢Ghosting of free edge of lateral meniscus with 
    increased signal.
Radial tear of the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus
â€¢ Radial meniscal tear
â€¢ Longitudinal/circumferential/bucket handle meniscal tear
20 year old male, varsity basketball player, with 1 day history of left knee pain after sustaining varus stress to his left knee.
Operative treatment for the patient's anterior horn tear was challenging secondary to the location of the tear and the technical aspects of arthroscopy. Operative treatment in this case was performed because the patient is a high level athlete without medical problems and with good prognosis for complete recovery.
