HCC occurs in 19-24% of pts with hemochromatosis, which is a 20 to 200 fold increased risk compared with the general population (similar to that of pts with cirrhosis secondary to viral hepatitis).  Risk factors include advancing age (>50), male sex, and the presence of cirrhosis.  LFTâ€™s are often normal as the pathophysiology is not an inflammatory process.  HCC is the leading cause of death in pts with hemochromatosis (approximately 30%).  Other causes include cardiac failure resulting from iron deposition in the heart tissue and hepatic failure. 
FNH is almost always seen in women of childbearing age (90%) and is frequently associated with oral contraceptive use.
The remainder of the abdominal pelvic CT was neg for malignancy and pts unremarkable physical exam (non-cachectic) makes mets unlikely.
