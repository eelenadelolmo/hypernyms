Texto: 
Genitourinary:  Slightly enlarged right testes with a firm protruding mass.  The epididymis and cord structures are normal.  There is evidence of a varicocele on the left.  There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Labs:  The urinalysis was unremarkable.  AFP=2.2, B-HCG=<2, LDH=125, CBC and BMP are also within normal range.
Excision of epidermoid cyst with salvage of the testes.
Chest X-ray with normal lung fields.
Scrotal US shows a very small hydrocele on the right with a solid mass and two areas of shadowing.  The mass is 1.4 cm in greatest diameter.  The left testes is normal.
Epidermoid Cyst
Epidermoid cyst
Hematoma
Dermoid cyst
Teratoma
Juvenile granulosa cell tumor
Simple testicular cyst
The patient is a 14 y/o male who presents with a right testicular mass along with dysuria and frequency for one month.  His past medical history includes bilateral inguinal hernia repair.  He is otherwise healthy.
Radiologic findings are important in the diagnosis of an epidermoid cyst.  Most intratesticular masses are malignant and require an orchiectomy.  In the treatment of an epidermoid tumor, excisional removal of the tumor allows for salvage of the testes.  This patient demostrated the classic radiologic findings:  a well defined mass with a suggestion of layers (onion skin) and focal areas of shadow which may indicate calcifications, and little or no flow on doppler.
