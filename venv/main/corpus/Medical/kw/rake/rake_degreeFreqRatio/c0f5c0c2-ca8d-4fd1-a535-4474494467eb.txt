Surgical enucleation with wide bone margins or marsupialization.  Most recurrent lesion are found in the first 5 years after enucleation but recurrence may be delayed for up to 10 years.
The left maxillary sinus demonstrates bony remodeling with complete opacification.  A tooth is within the left maxillary sinus with a surrounding cyst.  The cyst has a thinly calcified rim.

21 y.o. man for routine dental check up.  With probing questions, he complained of a history of chronic nasal congestion and drainage.
Most odontogenic keratocysts occur during the 2nd through 4th decades of life as was the case with this patient.  The thin sclerotic rim around the cyst and the bony remodeling of the maxillary sinus seen in this case are also highly characteristic of an odontogenic keratocyst.  This patient should be screened for the basal cell nevus syndrome and Marfan's syndrome since these disorders have an association with odontogenic keratocysts.  An ameloblastoma can arise in the wall of an odontogenic keratocyst.  There aren’t any radiographic findings to aid in the diagnosis of an ameloblastoma.  For this reason, a biopsy and surgical resection are necessary to obtain the final diagnosis.  Odontogenic keratocysts are more likely to show aggressive growth than other odontogenic cysts.  This cyst had a unilocular appearance; however, a multilocular appearance with undulating borders can be seen as well.  Odontogenic keratocysts are often associated with an impaction or ectopic eruption of a tooth as in this case.  The location of this cyst in the maxillary sinus is consistent with an odontogenic keratocyst; however, the body and ramus of the mandible are the more common locations for this lesion.
