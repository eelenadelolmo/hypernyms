Other than the reported rupture of the right tympanic membrane, there are no pertinent physical findings.
Because there was no definitive evidence of bone erosion, antibiotics were continued with the plan of follow-on imaging of the right mastoid if complications are suspected.  Therapy for lymphoma continues, and future PET scans of this patient are likely, allowing for evaluation of resolution of the mastoiditis.
Images taken from a PET/CT exam demonstrate opacification of the right mastoid air cell without evidence of osseous erosion.  There is abnormal metabolic activity (SUV = 7.3) at this site.  Also noted are areas of abnormally increased metabolic activity in the left anterior cervical nodal chain, both supraclavicular regions, in the prevascular space and the right internal mammary chain consistent with the patient's known diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease.
Acute Otomastoiditis (non-coalescent)
Acute otomastoiditis
Coalescent mastoiditis
Lymphoma infiltrating Mastoid
19 year old male with history of stage II Hodgkin's lymphoma.  The patient had this PET scan ordered to assess response to chemotherapy.  Once the scan was complete, the additional pertinent history of a recent perforated tympanic membrane on the right was obtained.  According to the oncologist taking care of this patient, the patient was taking antibiotics due to the TM rupture.
It is not unexpected to have fluid in the mastoid after perforation of the tympanic membrane.  The significant metabolic activity of the right mastoid "raises the bar" of suspicion that this process is active and could become coalescent in the future, necessitating continued surveillance.
