Vital signs are normal.  There is swelling of the left eye.  The bilateral eyes track normally and there is normal pupil response to light and accomodation.
Surgical repair is performed if diplopia does not resolve spontaneously, there is severe enophthalmus or the fracture is large, and is usually postponed for up to two weeks to allow swelling to resolve.
Fracture of the left lamina papyracea with herniation of orbital fat into the ethmoid air cells.  There is a moderate amount of orbital air.  There is no evidence of orbital floor fracture.
Blowout fracture of orbit.
Blow-out fracture.
24 year old Caucasian male who was struck in the left eye approximately 1 week prior.  The patient reports diplopia with upward gaze and has noticed air exiting his left eye when blowing his nose.
This patient was followed by Ophthamology and did not require surgical intervention.  He was placed on prophylactic oral antibiotics to prevent orbital infection.
