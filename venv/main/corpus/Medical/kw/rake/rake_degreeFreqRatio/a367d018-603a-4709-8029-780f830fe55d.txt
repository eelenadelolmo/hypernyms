Texto: 
There is focal tenderness to palpation over the medial aspect of the thigh and over the midshaft of the left femur.  CBC is within normal limits.

Left femur radiographs interpreted as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù at the referring institution are not available for review.
Not available in this case.  Please refer to the accompanying factoid.
Axial and coronal T1 and fat saturated axial and coronal T2-weighted MR images through the left femur:

1).  There is a thin rim of high signal intensity along the medial periosteum of the mid femoral diaphysis, visualized to best advantage on the coronal T2 FS sequence.

2).  Also noted is extensive abnormal T2 hyperintense, T1 hypointense signal within the femoral diaphyseal marrow, compatible with edema.  On the axial imaging sequences, this edema pattern is seen to be somewhat eccentrically located in the medial half of the marrow cavity. 

3).  Visualized to best advantage on the axial T1 and axial FS T2-weighted images is a faint, focal area of abnormal signal within the posteromedial femoral midshaft cortex, consistent with a developing stress fracture.  Note the focal collection of crescentic T2 hypointense material overlying the fracture site on the axial T2 FS image, compatible with some focal periosteal reaction at the site of stress fracture.
Femur Stress Fracture
Osteoid osteoma could have a similar MR appearance and should be excluded radiographically.
A 26-year-old Caucasian female presents to her primary care physician with the complaint of a 3-4 week history of left knee pain (she denies a specific traumatic episode) after which she noted a one-week history (ongoing) of sharp pain and tenderness over the medial aspect of the mid femur.
Please refer to the accompanying factoid.
