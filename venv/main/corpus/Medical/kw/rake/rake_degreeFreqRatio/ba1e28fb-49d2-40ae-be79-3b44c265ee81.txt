Texto: 
The patient exibited increased breath sounds bilaterally.
He had a d-dimer of .4 ug/FEU/ml.
Medical treatment included smoking cessation and inhalers.
Perfusion and ventilation images demonstrate matched segmental defects throughout both lungs.  "Pooling" of the radiotracer is present in the bases bilaterally suggestive of emphasematous changes.
Severe emphysema with low probability for pulmonary embolism
Low probability for pulmonary embolism
Severe Emphysema
65 year old white male with a 45 pack-year history of smoking presents with mild shortness of breath.
This patient demonstrates the grossly abnormal findings when performing a V/Q scan on a patient with severe emphasema disease.  It is unlikely this patient has an embolism, however there is a small possibility an embolism is disguised behind the diffuse abnormalities demonstrated.
