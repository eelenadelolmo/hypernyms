VS P 93 BP 128/88 RR 18 T 99.0

Abdomen:  Decreased bowel sounds, mild distension with diffuse TTP.  No masses appreciated.  No fluid wave.  No bruits.  No skin changes.  No groin mass.

Remaining exam non-contributory.
CT:  Fluid distended loops of small bowel;  poor transit of enteric contrast, even with subsequently performed delayed imaging; slight inflammatory changes at the right groin medial to the femoral vessels.

US:  Cystic structure overlying the right groin without vascular flow.  Better appreciated on real-time imaging, this structure connects to peristalsing bowel.
R femoral Hernia with small bowel obstruction
Small bowel obstruction secondary to femoral hernia
or inguinal hernia
72 yo female presents to the emergency room with abdominal pain and nausea for several days.  Medical history significant for well-controlled hypertension.
