No contributory findings
The patient's dizziness subsided and the patient was discharged home with outpatient follow up.

Due to the fact that pathology was not obtained the diagnosis of meningioma is presumed and not confirmed.  Bone invasion is an unusual but not unheard of complication of aggressive meningeal tumors.
Extraaxial hyperdense lesion on unenhanced CT which has a peripheral rim of calcification and involves the inner table of the skull.  On MR images, the anterior fossa extraaxial mass is hypintense on T1 and T2 images and enhances with contrast administration.
