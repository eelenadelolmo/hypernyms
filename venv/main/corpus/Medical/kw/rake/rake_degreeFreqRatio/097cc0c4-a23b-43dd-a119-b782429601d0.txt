Bruit over the right neck.
The patient was referred to vascular surgery for further evaluation.
Critical stenosis of the proximal right internal carotid artery due to an calcified plaque.  The peak systolic velocity measures greater than 540 cm/sec at the stenosis.  Velocity is greatly reduced distally.
Carotid stenosis due to atherosclerosis.
Atherosclerosis
Temporal arteritis
Fibromuscular dysplasia
78 year-old male presents to the clinic complaining of dizziness.  He has a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and coronary artery disease.  He had a myocardial infarction in the past.
Calcified plaques are much less likely to ulcerate than soft plaques.  

In this case, the presenting symptom, dizziness, may have been unrelated to the carotid disease. The plaque may be stable. 

Let us suppose, for a moment, that this patient's symptoms were not related to his carotid disease.  According to the medical literature, he would still gain a relative risk reduction of approximately 50% from a carotid endarterectomy (ACAS, ACST).  

However, the annual risk of stroke in an asymptomatic patient with a greater than 60% stenosis is 1 in 50.  This means that endarterectomy only reduces the rate of stroke per year in this population by one percent.

Now that 64 Detector Helical CT is universally available, it might be prudent to perform a CTA to assess plaque morphology isometrically before rushing to stenting or surgery.
