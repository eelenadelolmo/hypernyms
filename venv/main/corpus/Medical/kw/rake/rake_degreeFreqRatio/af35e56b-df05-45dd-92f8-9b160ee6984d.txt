Texto: 
12-lead EKG demonstrated marked ST elevations c/w an acute infarct.
During initial ER presentation patient became pulseless and was resuscitated for one hour, when a stable rhythm was established.
Noncontrast CT images demonstrate effacement of the the sulci. There is diffuse graying of the cerebral hemispheres with blurring and loss of normal gray-white differentiation and interface.  The ventricles are small. Note that the cerebellum and brainstem are well preserved and have a normal appearance.
Also note pansinusitis with air-fluid level in sphenoids.
Diffuse Cerebral Edema from cardiac arrest
Any anoxic or hypoxic events - to include drowning, strangulation
Closed Head Injury
(These findings can be normal in premature infants)
35 year old man presented to the emergency department with complaints of epigastric pain. He is diaphoretic, but otherwise appears in good health.  During initial ER presentation patient became pulseless and was resuscitated for one hour, until a stable rhythm was established.
Patient is currently in poor condition in the ICU with deteriorating neurologic exam.
