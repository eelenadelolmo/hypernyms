There is a continuous thin grey line seen between the lung and the lateral aspect of the rib cage.  The are no vascular marking seen lateral to the line.  This line is the pleura seen "end-on" or in tangent.

Pneumothorax
Pneumothorax
A 25 year old male presents with pleuritic chest pain and tachypnea.
Editor's Note: Any pneumothorax one observes as a radiologist should be considered a potential tension pneumothorax until history or stability over time proves it to be otherwise.  

The ordering physician should be contacted directly regarding this diagnosis.  For medical-legal reasons, the ACR suggests that the name of the doctor, the substance of the conversation, the date, and the time should be included in the radiologist's report.
