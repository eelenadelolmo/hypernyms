Â» Initial presentation
â€¢Cervical ROM was diminished with localized facet and muscular pain bilaterally. Also cervical distraction and compression testing revealed localized cervical pain with pain also radiating to the right shoulder.

â€¢Active ROM of the shoulders revealed pain in the right shoulder region with associated impingement syndrome over the right shoulder.  The Jobe's strength test (Empty Can Test),  Neers test, and Hawkins Kennedy test were all positive.  

â€¢Patient also experienced tingling in the right hand 

â€¢Severe tenderness at the rotator cuff insertion.

â€¢Muscle strengths of the neck and upper extremities were of essentially normal strength bilaterally with the exception to the right deltoid rated 4/5, wrist flexion on the right 4/5, finger opposition on the right 4/5.  The patient's grip strength was tested using a Jamar dynamometer.  The right hand tested to 105 lbs. and the left hand tested to 120 lbs. The patient reports that he is right hand dominant. Hypomobility and deep palpation produced reported tenderness over the cervico-thoracic spinal region with associated myospasm on the right involving C3-C5. 

â€¢The reflexes of the triceps, biceps, and brachioradialis were 2/4 bilaterally.
The patient has since received physical therapy to increase ROM and ultrasound guided anterior subacromial corticosteroid injection which offered mild relief. Additionally the patient is scheduled to under go surgical repair of the partially torn supraspinatus tendon.
MRI of right Shoulder 4/8/2011
Â»:   The supraspinatus tendon demonstrates Short segmental partial thickness distal undersurface tear .  No fluid is seen in the adjacent subacromial or subdeltoid bursa. 
Â»The infraspinatus, subscapularis and long head of the biceps tendons are intact.  
Â»There is moderate osteoarthrosis of the AC joint. 
Â»The labrum is intact.  
Â»There is no fracture.

The patientâ€™s initial presentation consisted of neck and shoulder pain as well as tingling and weakness of the right hand.  The symptoms could have been caused by the shoulder itself or by the compression of cervical nerve roots.  To potentially localize the shoulder as the cause of the symptoms an injection of 80 mg Kenalog and 10cc Lidocaine was administered to the subacromial space and the ROM and pain in the right shoulder improved by 50 percent. Additionally, in order to rule out cervical radiculopathy, an EMG was performed and showed no abnormalities with the nerve conduction at the cervical level. This indicated that the symptoms in the right shoulder were a direct result of the partial tear of the supraspinatus. This case illustrates the importance of combining the orthopedic tests of the physical exam, subacromial injection, and EMG nerve studies to the imaging technology of MRI in-order to come to a definitive diagnosis.
