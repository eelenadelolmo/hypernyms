Texto: 
Decreased breath sounds left lower lung.  Normal WBC.
Patient went to surgery where she underwent partial resection of the lingula, which revealed an intrabronchial fungus ball with no tissue invasion.  Special stains were consistent with Aspergillus, which correlated with the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus on the patient's cultures from a previous bronchoscopy.
â€¢ Portable CXR (AP) shows a mass within the left lower lung with an eccentric lucency within it.
â€¢ Axial CT images through the chest demonstrate a soft tissue density mass within the lingula with surrounding dilated bronchioles and airspace opacities.
Aspergilloma Fungus Ball
â€¢ Neoplasm
â€¢ Infection
â€¢ Bronchial Obstruction
82 year old woman presenting to the emergency room with hemoptysis.
