Cholecystectomy
CT demonstrates mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, with enhancement observed in the hepatic parenchyma adjacent to the gallbladder on the early arterial phase of imaging. The gallbladder is distended and demonstrates a diffusely thickened wall measuring 4-5 mm, with no evidence of gallstones.  Inflammatory fat stranding is observed adjacent to the gallbladder.
