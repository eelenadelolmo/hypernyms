Cholecystectomy
CT demonstrates mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, with enhancement observed in the hepatic parenchyma adjacent to the gallbladder on the early arterial phase of imaging. The gallbladder is distended and demonstrates a diffusely thickened wall measuring 4-5 mm, with no evidence of gallstones.  Inflammatory fat stranding is observed adjacent to the gallbladder.
Subacute Cholecystitis
Acute cholecystitis
Choledocholithiasis
47 yo Caucasian male with two weeks of ill-defined right abdominal pain, with acute worsening over the past 12 hours, sent to CT to evaluate for appendicitis.
The stones in this case were among the ~35% not detectable on CT.
