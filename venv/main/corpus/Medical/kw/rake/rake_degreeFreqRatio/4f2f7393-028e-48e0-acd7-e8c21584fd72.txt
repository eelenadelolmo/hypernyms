Texto: 
Normal range of motion for joint, although somewhat painful with motion, especially with extremes in extension of the arm and abduction of the shoulder joint.
The treatment of choice is surgical resection. Incompletely resected lesions often recur.
Frontal radiograph of the right shoulder in internal rotation showing several flocculent calcific densities lateral and posterior to the right humeral head.

45 year old hispanic male with a 3 month history of progressively worsening pain in the right shoulder.
Tumoral calcinosis is a rare disorder most commonly seen in people of African ancestry. The cause is not clear, but manifestations often occur early in life, affecting the hips most frequently, then buttocks, elbows and smaller joints. Histology of the disorder is characterized by densely loculated masses of calcified debris and fluid enclosed in a fibrous architecture. Lesions grow slowly and do not generally cause pain unless nerves are involved.
