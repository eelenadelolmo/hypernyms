Texto: 
Palpable large left-sided varicocele.
None required, however, surgical ligation should be considered given the patient's history of undesired infertility.
Ultrasound images demonstrate multiple left peritesticular small, round, cystic structures that communicate with each other (appreciated on real-time cine images) consistent with dilated peristesticular veins.  Most of these structures are 2-3 mm or greater in diameter.  Augmented venous flow is demonstrated during Valsalva maneuver.
Varicocele
Varicocele
Thirty one-year-old male with infertility and history of left-sided varicocele ligation approximately five years ago.
This was a reported recurrent left-sided varicocele after unsuccessful surgical ligation.
