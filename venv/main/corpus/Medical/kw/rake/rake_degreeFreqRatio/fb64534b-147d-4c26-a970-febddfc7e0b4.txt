Normal exam and normal laboratory values.
The patient underwent a partial nephrectomy to remove the tumor which was complicated by a post operative urinoma. This required a percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement for urinary diversion. In addition, during the interventional procedure a collection of complicated fluid was identified at the lower aspect of the urinoma which also required percutaneous drainage.
Horseshoe kidney with large mass in the left kidney.  Patient also had a stone in the left sided collecting system.  

Coronal images demonstrate extravasation of contrast representing urinoma after partial nephrectomy to remove renal mass.  

Fluroscopic images demonstrate placement of nephrostomy tube and abscess drainage tube.
Renal Cell Carcinoma.
Mass in the Left kidney could represent:
-  Renal Cell Carcinoma
-  Oncocytoma
-  Adenoma
-  Metastasis
-  Wilms' tumor.
Patient is a 21 year old male who presented with a 5 month history of painless hematuria. The hematuria was more pronounced after vigourous exercise.  Otherwise patient has been in good health.
Horseshoe kidney is a relatively common renal anomaly, occuring in 1 in 400 births. It is more common in males, 2 to 1.  The abnormality is thought to occur because of an abnormal position of the umbilical artery which inhibits normal cephalad migration of the fetal kidneys. The metanephric blastema is pushed together and fuses, usually at the lower pole.  

The central isthmus can either contain parenchymal tissue or it can be a simply fibrous band.  The parenchymal isthmus is more common.  The isthmus is normally anterior to the aorta and IVC, but posterior to the inferior mesenteric artery.  

Patients with horseshoe kidney can remain assymptomatic throughout their lives.  However patients with horseshoe kidney are at increased risk for developing a variety of abnormalities including:
- ureteropelvic junction obstruction (30%).
- infection.
- renal calculus.
- carcinoma.
- increased risk from traumatic injury especially when the isthmus has normal paranchyma.
