The lesion was removed as it was pedunculated and large.
Axial CT image demonstrates a large fat-attenuation mass within the lumen of the sigmoid colon.
Sigmoid Lipoma

Liposarcoma
Ingested fat
Intermittent lower abdominal pain
As screening CT Colonography (CTC) continues to increase in use, review of common polypoid colonic lesions (such as lipoma and adenoma) becomes important.  Colonic lipomas are common benign tumors with a characteristic fatty appearance.  Smaller lipomas are being found more frequently due to increased efforts to use CTC and optical colonoscopy.
