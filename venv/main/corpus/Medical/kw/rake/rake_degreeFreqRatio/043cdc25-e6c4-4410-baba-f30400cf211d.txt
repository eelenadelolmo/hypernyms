Rash on left breast invovling the nipple
MRI:  There is a 2.3 x 3 x 4 cm area of abnormal avid enhancement in
the upper, outer quadrant of the right breast that has a time intensity curve
suspicious for malignancy.  There are portions of this mass that extend
toward the nipple, but no clearly defined retroareolar mass lesion is
appreciated. There is asymmetric enhancement of a right axillary lymph node,
at the level of the nipple, that measures 8 mm AP x 5 mm transverse.  It
enhances similarly to the mass on the early phases.  There are no suspicious
areas of enhancement or morphologic abnormality in the left breast.

Mammogram: normal
Paget's Disease of the Breast
47 year old with erythema and pruritis surrounding nipples and areola of the right breast.
Pagetâ€™s disease of the breast is a form of ductal carcinoma that involves the epidermis.  The area of skin typically affected is the nipple, areola and surrounding region. Pagetâ€™s disease comprises only 1 to 5 percent of breast cancers.  Clinically it appears as redness, scaling, ulceration and erosion of the breast epidermis.  Patients often complain of pruritis .  Typically, women present early and thus will have favorable survival rates.  Often the mammogram will be normal.  However, nipple retraction, calcifications, skin thickening and masses may be observed on the study.  Ultrasound findings may or may not reveal any abnormalities.  Diagnosis of Pagetâ€™s disease is made through a skin biopsy.  MRI has become useful in determining the extent of the disease.
