Left neck mass. Euthyroid.
Total thyroidectomy
Radioiodine ablation
Synthroid replacement with TSH suppression

Followed semi-annually to annually with ultrasound, thyroglobulin, scintigraphy
Thyroid US
Cystic and solid mass with internal flow in the solid components and calcifications.  Adjacent separate solid vascular mass lateral to the internal jugular vein.

MR Neck
Axial T2, T1 post contrast, and Coronal T1 post contrast images demonstrate a partially solid, partially cystic left neck mass arising from the thyroid gland with avidly enhancing frond like solid components.  There is a separate round T2 bright, avidly enhancing mass lateral to the internal jugular vein.
Papillary Thyroid Cancer
Thyroid carcinoma (papillary, follicular, anaplastic)
Thyroid lymphoma
