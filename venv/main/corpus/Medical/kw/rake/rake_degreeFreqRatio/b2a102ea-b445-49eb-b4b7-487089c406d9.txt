Texto: 
Negative work-up for clotting disorders, including proein c and s, lupus anticoagulant, and cardiolipin antibodies.
Treated with anticoagulation and monitored with imaging studies.
Complete occlusion of the right lateral sinus and jugular vein.  Partial occlusion by thrombus of the superior sagital sinus, straight sinus, and vein of Galen.  Mild edema in the right cerebral hemisphere, including the right frontal lobe. Thrombosis of multiple cortical and deep veins.  Subtotal opacification of the right mastoid air cells.

Small right parietal venous hemorrhagic infarcts x 2
Intracranial Venous Thrombosis
27 yo female smoker on OCPâ€™s with no significant past medical history presents with a worsening headache and left arm weakness.
The combination of mastoiditis, smoking, and oral contraceptive use likely resulted in this patient's pathology occuring at an unusually young age.
