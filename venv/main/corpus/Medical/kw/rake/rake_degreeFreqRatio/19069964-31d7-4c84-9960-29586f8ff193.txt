Vital Signs WNL
Patient had left flank pain to tenderness
UA: Large blood in urine, otherise normal
No other focal findings or labs
Pain management with NSAID and allow the ureteroliths to pass on their own.  Specialist referral to urology for further work up or intervention if stones continue or recur.
Non contrast CT of the abdomen demonstrates perinephric stranding of the left kidney and mild hydronephrosis.  Two distal left ureteroliths are present, associated with obstruction and both measuring about 6 mm.  Also fatty replacement of the left psoas muscle from a previous myositis.
Ureterolithiasis
Ureterolithasis with obstruction
Neoplasm (TCC)
Peripelvic cysts
Preexisting perinephric fat stranding
Atherosclerotic calcifications
Phleboliths
51 y/o male presented to the ER with acute sharp left flank pain and blood in urine.
This patient had a long history of nephrolithasis and recent hematuria and left flank pain.  CT demonstrated two left distal ureteral stones both measuring 6 mm in size.  The patient passed the stones without instrumentation.  Specialist referral was made and the stones were determined to be calcium oxalate.
