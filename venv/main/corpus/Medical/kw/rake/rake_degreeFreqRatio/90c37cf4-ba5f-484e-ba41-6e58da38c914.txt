Gen: Drowsy, elderly appearing white female. 
Resp: lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally
CV: regular rate and rhythm 
GI: nondistended, nontender, bowel sounds present
Skin: R. elbow,  erythematous skin posteriorly with 2 draining wounds.
Pt was taken to OR. Incision made over TEA scar. A large amount of prurulent material bubbled out of the incision. A total of ~1 cup of necrotic/prurulent material was removed from the R. elbow. The proximal ulna had a "moth-eaten" appearance with a large sequestrum. An attempt was made to remove as much cement as possible but it was felt that the infection was not at the bone-cement interface but at the outside of the bone. The TEA was removed and good portion of the proximal ulna was resected.

The cultures form the sequestrum grew out Staph aureus. The patient will be treated with Nafcillin 2gm q4hrs x6weeks, and Rifampin 600mg PO qD x6weeks.
12Jul2000- TEA, medial distal humerus fracture. Minimal displacement, apex lateral angulation.

06Mar2001-TEA, bony lysis distal humerus, lytic lesions of distal humerus and proximal ulna.

09Mar2001-TEA removed, cement ball in elbow joint, resection of proximal humerus, periprosthetic fracture of distal humerus. Packing material in wound.

5-6 wks of discharge from wound on R. elbow. Discharge serosanguinous x2 weeks turning to a thick, grey discharge. Pt had total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) 6 yrs ago and reports 2 year history chronic elbow pain. Humerus fracture July 2000 as son pulled on arm helping patient up stairs. Seen by local orthopedist 1 day prior to presentation, started on Keflex.
