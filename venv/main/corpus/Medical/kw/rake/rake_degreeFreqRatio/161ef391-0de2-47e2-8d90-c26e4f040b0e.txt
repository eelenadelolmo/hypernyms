No abnormalities.
.
Solid column esophogram was performed with thin barium, the patient in prone RPO and LPO positions.  This showed smooth, round postrior impression on the esophagus.

Contrast enhanced axial CT images show a left sided arch and descending aorta with an abarent right subclavian artery passing posterior to the esophagus.
Left Aortic Arch with Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery
Based solely on the esophogram:
Aberrant right subclavian artery.
Mural esophogeal mass, such as a leiomyoma.
Extrinsic mass, such as a paraganglioma.
48 year old female with dysphagia.
