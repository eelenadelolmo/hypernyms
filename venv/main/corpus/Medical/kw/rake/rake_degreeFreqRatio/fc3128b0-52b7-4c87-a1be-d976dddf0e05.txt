CT chest with intravenous contrast demonstrates a contrast opacified vessel originating at the junction of the left internal jugular vein and left subclavian vein and coursing along the left mediastinum emptying into a dilated coronary sinus.
Left superior vena cava
88 y/o male with CHF, atrial fibrillation, and cardiac pacemaker with worsening shortness of breath and lower extremity edema.
Left SVC more apparent on the current exam with left upper extremity contrast injection due to increased contrast opacification compared to the right SVC which contains two pacer leads.  Prior exam had contrast injection right upper extremity for comparison with greater contrast opacification of the right SVC.
