Digital rectal examination: a firm, palpable mass in the left lobe of the prostate.

LABORATORY VALUES:
*Elevated PSA (19.3)
*Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level
*Thrombocytopenia (Platelet count 66,000)

Recent outside radiographs of the spine and pelvis:
heterogeneous appearance of bones...query diffuse osteoblastic metastatic disease.
The patient underwent XRT (3000 cGy in 300 cGy per fraction in a total of 10 fractions with a PA beam
only using 15 MV photons) and reported a marked improvement in his bone pain following treatment.
Anterior and posterior whole-body scintigrams show diffuse abnormal increased radiotracer activity throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton, involving the humeri, proximal femora, proximal radii, sternum, ribs (anteriorly and posteriorly), and pelvis.  Note that despite the presence of significant bladder activity, the kidneys are only faintly visualized.
Superscan indicative of diffuse osteoblastic disease from metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma.
"SUPERSCAN" DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS"

WIDESPREAD OSSEOUS LESIONS:
*Diffuse skeletal metastases (esp. from prostate and breast CA)
*Myelofibrosis/myelosclerosis
*Aplastic anemia, leukemia
*Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia
*Systemic mastocytosis
*Widespread Paget disease

METABOLIC DISORDERS:
*Renal osteodystrophy
*Osteomalacia
*Hyperparathyroidism
A 63 year old African American male with a one month history of back pain.
