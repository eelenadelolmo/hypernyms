Vitals within normal range, normal labs
Majority of patients are asymptomatic and hence no further action is necessary.  Larger lesion may require closer follow up as mass effect may cause various symptoms.  In those cases, surgical resection may be considered.
-solitary left adrenal mass measuring 2.8cm in diameter
- focal areas of hypodensity within a circumscrimed higher attenuation mass. 
-no areas of calcification
Adrenal Myelolipoma
Adrenal Adenoma
Adrenal Carcinoma
Angiomyolipoma
Liposarcoma
Adrenal Myelolipoma
68 yo male with history of gross hematuria with no other complaints
The etiology of this patient's episode of gross hematuria is unclear, and there is no indication that there may have been hemorrhage within the adrenal myelolipoma as there are no areas of acute bleeding or calcification present.  Hence it is reasonable that the cause of hematuria be extra-adrenal.  The size of this patient's adrenal mass does not appear to interrupt the architecture of other surrounding organs.  Prognosis of this patient is good in terms of the adrenal mass as he has been asymptomatic with normal hormonal labs.  Follow up imaging may be indicated to monitor the growth of the mass.
