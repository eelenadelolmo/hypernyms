PHYSICAL EXAM:	Loose skin with yellowish papules circling the neck, axillae and antecubital fossae.
HISTOPATHOLOGY: Sections demonstrated basophilic degeneration of the elastic fibers in the mid dermis. Von Kossa stain for calcium salts highlighted the degenerated elastic fibers.
Evaluations by GI, Ophthalmology, Cardiology and Vascular Surgery have all been accomplished within the last year. She had characteristic angioid streaks and claudication.
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM (1997 Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, Case#24) submitted by: John LeVasseur, Maj, MC, USAF
patient referred from Plastic Surgery to discuss interventions to improve neck skin irregularities. Past history was notable for pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), confirmed by skin biopsy in 1973. She reported gradually increased wrinkling, pigment and texture changes over the years. There was a family history of two sisters and one nephew with similar involvement and a nephew with a positive history of GI bleeding.
