Dry cough during exam - Rhonchi left posterior chest - Afebrile.
No elevation of WBC.  IgM titer positive (1:32 dilution).
The patient received initial doses of Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin in the ER and then was treated with oral Levoquin for 5 days at home.
Left hemithorax patchy airspace opacity which localizes to the superior segment of the left lower lobe on the lateral projection. Airspace opacity cleared on repeat imaging 4 weeks after treatment.
Pneumonia - Mycoplasma pneumoniae
• CAP (Community Acquired Pneumonia)
• Mycoplasma pneumonia
• Other atypical pneumonias
28 year-old with persistent cough and fever.
Radiologists often do not know the causative organism in cases of community acquired pneumonia (CAP).  When the agent is known, however, it is helpful to review the images to assist clinicians with future cases.  The frequency quoted in the medical literature supports the notion that many of the CAP cases thought to be early lobar pneumonia may actual be bronchopneumonia limited to a single lower lobe from Mycoplasmpa pneumoniae infection.
