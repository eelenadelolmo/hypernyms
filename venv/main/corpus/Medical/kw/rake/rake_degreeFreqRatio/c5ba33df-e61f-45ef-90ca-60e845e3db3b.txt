Asymptomatic lesions can be monitored with radiographs and clinical follow up.  Enlarging or symptomatic periosteal chondromas are usually removed with a rim of normal bone to decrease the chance of recurrence.  Malignant degeneration into a peripheral chondrosarcoma is extremely rare with these lesions.
AP and lateral radiographs of the right tibia and fibula:  A cortically based radiolucent lesion is present along the proximal lateral metaphysis of the fibula.  There is associated saucerization of the underlying bone cortex with an outer rim of periosteum and a very minimal periosteal reaction.  The lesion is confined to the cortex and does not appear to extend into the medullary canal.  No soft tissue mass is visualized.
Periosteal Chondroma
â€¢ Periosteal Chondrosarcoma
Complained of a palpable bump and mild pain along the right lateral lower extremity.
This patient is 38 years old which is a typical age when these lesions occur.  Most periosteal chondromas occur during the second through fourth decades of life.  This patientâ€™s lesion involves the proximal metaphysis of the fibula (a long bone) which is typical for periosteal chondromas.  The fact that this patientâ€™s lesion is cortically based and causes saucerization or scalloping of the underlining bone cortex is highly characteristic of a periosteal chondroma.  The lesion also has a thin rim of overlying periosteum with a very mild periosteal reaction which are also characteristic features of periosteal chondromas.  This patientâ€™s lesion is also smaller than 3 cm which is more consistent with periosteal chondromas.  Periosteal chondrosarcomas tend to be larger and demonstrate invasion into the underlying cortex unlike the lesion in this case.
