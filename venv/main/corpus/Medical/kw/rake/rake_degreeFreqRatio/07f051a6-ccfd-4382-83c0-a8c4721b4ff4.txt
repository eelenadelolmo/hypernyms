Texto: 
Port-A-Cath hub palpated in left upper chest; rest of exam and labs unremarkable.
Patient was referred to interventional radiology and underwent a successful catheter retrieval procedure via the femoral vein.  The Port-A-Cath hub was also removed successfully from the upper chest.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged home after spending the night in the hospital for observation.

A common mechanism for catheter embolization is ‚Äúpinch-off‚Äù syndrome, which may or may not be evident on chest x-ray.  This condition occurs in catheters placed via the subclavian vein.  The catheter lumen passes between the clavicle and first rib before entering the subclavian vein lumen, usually observed when the skin incision for the port is made medial to the mid-clavicular line.  Repeated trauma to the catheter during shoulder adduction weakens the catheter‚Äôs structural integrity, eventually leading to fracture and subsequent embolization. 

Optimal placement of a Port-A-Cath is via the right internal jugular vein.
