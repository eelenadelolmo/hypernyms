Texto: 
The patient's physical exam was unremarkable.  Notable negative findings included the absence of hepatosplenomegally, ascites, or other stigmata of chronic liver disease.

The patient's liver function tests were only mildly elevated.  She was anemic.

Grade four gastric varices were identified in the fundus of the stomach during endoscopy.
This patient was followed on a medical basis because surgical and interventional treatment was contraindicated due to her overall medical condition.
Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated normal hepatopedal flow in the portal vein and patent hepatic veins.   (No images)

A three vessel mesenteric angiographic study revealed abnormal small arteries arising from the short gastric arteries.  These abnormal arteries had multiple direct connections to the gastric venous plexus.  Innumberable abnormal ectatic and aneurysmal submucosal veins were identified in the region of the fundus of the stomach, confirming the endoscopic findings.
Dieulafoy's lesion:  An angiographic finding of a gastric AVM
Budd-Chiari syndrome
Cirrhosis
Gastritis
AVM
A 53 y.o. female with upper GI bleeding refractory to endoscopic band ligation and electrocoagulation was refered to the interventional radiologist for a TIPS procedure.  

The interventional radiologist, after review of the patient's RUQ ultrasound and laboratory values, elected to perform a mesenteric angiogram rather than a TIPS procedure.

Subsequently, she was found to be an extremely poor candidate for surgical or interventional therapy and was followed on a medical basis.
This presentation of a Dieulafoy lesion is rare.  In this case, it mimicked liver disease and was not found until angiographic data was obtained.  Arterial embolization of this lesion is possible, but the overall morbidity of the patient was severly compromised.
