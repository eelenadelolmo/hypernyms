Pending workup.
PA and lateral radiograph of the chest demonstrates a round well defined mass in the left cardiophrenic angle.

Contrast enhanced CT of the chest demonstrates a low  attenuating lesion with a thin wall and a density of 16 Houndsfield units in the left cardiophrenic angle.  No associated adenopathy, effusion or parenchymal lesions are identified.
Pericardial Cyst
Pericardial cyst
Enteric duplication cyst
Thymic cyst
40 year old with left sided chest pain along costochondral junction with no history of trauma.
Based on the nonaggressive nature of this lesion (i.e. nonenhancing lesion with thin wall) and its location, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is a pericardial cyst.
