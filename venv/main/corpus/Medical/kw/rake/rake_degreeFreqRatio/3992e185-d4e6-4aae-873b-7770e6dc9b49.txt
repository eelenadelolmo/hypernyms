Texto: 
Laparoscopic Heller myotomy with partial fundoplication is a safe, effective treatment for achalasia.  The partial fundoplication decreases the incidence of postoperative reflux.  The treatment is considered first line for many patients, but can also be used when nonsurgical treatments fail.  Nonsurgical treatment includes botox injections, pneumatic dilation and calcium channel blockers.  This patient underwent Heller myotomy with fundoplication.

Fisichella PM.  Achalasia.  eMedicine, Oct 2006.
Barium esophogram demonstrates dilation of the esophagus with tapering at the gastroesophageal sphincter with a "bird beak" appearance.  I thin stream of contrast eventually passes into stomach.

Post Heller myotomy esophogram demontrated continued dilation of the esophagus with tapering, but contrast readily passed into the stomach.
Achalasia
Idiopathic achalasia
Secondary achalasia
Esophageal spasm
Esophageal carcinoma
Scleroderma
20 y/o male with two year history of  difficulty swallowing solids and liquids.
Patient stated that he was unable to swallow solid or liquids for two years.  He had compinsted by swallowing small amounts of food or liquid followed by bearing down to "force food through".  He was referred for UGI prior to surgical treatment.  Post-operative UGI demonstrated no leaks with contrast passing easily through the gastroesophageal junction.
