Patient is being followed by pediatric neurology.
The MR image (fig 1) and CT images (fig 2) demonstrate cerebellar tonsillar herniation, towering cerebellum, and tectal beaking due to a Chiari 2 malformation.
Chiari malformation
Chiari II malformation
Developmental Delay
Chiari described malformations of the hindbrain, spine, and mesoderm of the skull base/spinal column which were associated with hydrocephalus.  These malformations result from neural tube closure defects in utero.  Due to the closure defects, the cerebral ventricles fail to expand sufficiently for development of a normal sized posterior fossa and for normal separation of the thalami.  Note that the hindbrain malformations can be conceptualized as resulting from a normal-sized cerebellum developing in an abnormally small posterior fossa.

Types:
Chiari 1 - Cerebellar tonsils located more than 5-6mm inferior to the foramen magnum
Chiari 2 - Complex set of abnormalities: small posterior fossa, cerebellar herniations,
myelomeningocele, hydrocephalus, agenesis of the corpus callosum, thalamic 
Chiari 3 - Chiari 2 with cranio-cervical meningoencephalocele rather than a lumbar myelomeningocele.
