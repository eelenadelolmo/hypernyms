Physical exam demonstrated a large (1.5 x 1.5 cm) immobile mass at the left medial canthus just below the lower eyelid with overlying mild erythema but no discharge and no significant tenderness on palpation.
Urgent surgery was determined to be necessary and patient underwent medial maxillectomy and orbital exenteration. Post-surgical pathology reports indicated the deep margins were positive. Though ENT was skeptical these were true margins adjuvant radiation therapy was opted for to provide assurance of thorough eradication. Patient completed his course of radiation therapy and was disease free at month 5.
CT and MRI demonstrated a fungating mass occupying the entire left nasolacrimal duct displacing the left orbit to a significant degree.

A 31 yo man presented to his primary care doctor complaining of a growing bump under his Left eye. He was prescribed a course of antibiotics and referred to dermatology. After being examined by dermatology 2 weeks later, patient was sent to ophthalmology with concerns for dacryocystitis. Ophthalmology ordered a CT scan for further evaluation. The extent of involvement and the characteristics of the mass on CT made ophthalmology concerned for a malignancy so patient was referred to otolaryngology.
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most frequently diagnosed malignant tumor of the head and neck, and has the sixth highest incidence for cancers worldwide. It is most often diagnosed during the sixth and seventh decade in patients with specific risk factors, including tobacco use and alcohol consumption. SCC is also commonly associated with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. The majority of cases of SCC arise from preneoplastic lesions with dysplastic cytologic architecture most commonly affecting the pharynx, oropharynx and trachea. Uncommonly though, SCC can arise from normal mucosa, in young patients, with few risk factors and in difficult to visualize places, as the following case demonstrates. 
A 31 year old active duty male presented with a chief complaint of a bump beneath his left eye for the past two months. He reported intermittent yellow discharge at the corner near his nose, increased tearing, and increased pain, especially to palpation, over the previous two weeks. Review of all other systems was negative. He had no significant past medical history, denied any previous surgeries and his social history was negative for tobacco or alcohol abuse. His family history was unobtainable because the patient was adopted. Initial physical exam was significant for a firm, palpable lump just below the left lower eyelid. The lesion was 1 cm x 1 cm in size, skin-toned, non-erythematous, non-purulent, and mildly tender to palpation. The patient was prescribed a course of antibiotics and referred to dermatology. At his appointment with dermatology three weeks later, his symptoms were worse and the lesion had grown in size. He was sent to ophthalmology. A CT scan was ordered, which showed a fungating mass within the left lacrimal sac suspicious for malignancy.  He was referred to otolaryngology.  The patient had an unremarkable nasal endoscopy, as well as multiple biopsies by fine needle aspiration and direct excision. Results from tissue examination by pathology revealed non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma in situ: a malignant neoplasm.  The patient was managed with surgery combined with radiation therapy. In order to debulk the entire tumor and attain clear margins, enucleation of the left eye was required. Currently, the patient has numerous reconstructive surgeries planned, but is doing well overall with no sign of metastasis or recurrence. 
This case exemplifies the importance of early recognition of SCC and proper use of multidisciplinary consultation e.g. dermatology, ENT, ophthalmology and pathology for management of this disease.  Clinicians should be aware that painful, non-healing lesions, especially those with obstructive characteristics (which might indicate a space occupying neoplasm, as in this patient?s case), may represent an insidious process that requires thorough evaluation. SCC can present in patients from any demographic, without any risk factors, and who are otherwise healthy individuals.  Although this patient did require enucleation of his left eye, multiple surgical revisions, radiation therapy and close follow-up, his prognosis is good.  Attentive evaluation spared him from CNS extension and metastasis and reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with this subtle presentation of SCC.
