Texto: 
Left eye shows a large piece of a tree branch extending into the medial aspect of the left orbit, what appears to be pointed in the medial direction through the eyelid.
From the operative report: 
"The foreign body was gently removed. Of note, there was no bleeding evident after removal of foreign bodies. They were sent to microbiology for further analysis. The wound was explored. Small wooden splinters were removed."
Low density linear object (wood - tree branch) penetrates medical aspect of left orbit and into the ethmoid sinuses.
No penetration of the intracranial space nor right orbit.
Penetrating orbit injury
â€¢ Chopstick
â€¢ Pencil
â€¢ Coffee stirrer
â€¢ Twig
