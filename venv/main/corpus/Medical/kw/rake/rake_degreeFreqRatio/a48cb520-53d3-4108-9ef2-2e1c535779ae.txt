• Unremarkable physical exam
• Laboratory studies within normal limits
• Long-term observation with interval imaging to assess for progression of the lesion
• Medical management of symptoms (i.e. pain control)
• Bisphosphonates have been shown to reduce bone pain
• Surgery may be considered for complicated lesions with mass effect and/or resulting fractures
CT Head without contrast: Expansile ground glass lesion involving the ethmoid bone and crista galli with extension into the sphenoid sinuses with mass effect on the medial right orbit favored to represent fibrous dysplasia.

Follow-up CT of the orbits and sinuses: The known fibrous dysplasia is again seen involving the crista galli and ethmoid bone with extension into the sphenoid sinuses. Minimal interval expansion of the fibrous dysplastic lesion of the ethmoid bone and crista galli into the medial right orbit. 

Bone Scan: Moderately intense tracer activity in the region of the previously described ground-glass, expansile lesion centered on the ethmoid air cells, involving the crista galli and extending into the sphenoid sinuses

Fibrous dysplasia is a skeletal developmental anomaly of the bone-forming mesenchyme resulting from abnormal osteoblast function. Fibrous dysplasia is a nonheritable disease related to a sporadic mutation in the gene that encodes the subunit of a stimulatory G protein on chromosome 20. As a result, osteoblasts abnormally produce fibrous tissue within the bone marrow. Fracture is the most common complication of fibrous dysplasia. Malignant transformation occurs less than 0.5% of cases. 

Fibrous dysplasia represents approximately 5% of all benign bone tumors. Any bone can be affected. 70% of cases are the monostotic form whereas 30% are of the polystotic form. The incidence rates are equal in males and females. However the true incidence is unknown since many patients are asymptomatic.  Fibrous dysplasia usually presents in persons aged 3-15. Most cases manifest themselves before the age of 30. Clinically patients present with pain and deformity or with a pathologic fracture. Long bones are commonly affected. The femur is the most common long bone affected. Other common areas include the tibia, facial bones and skull. 

The diagnosis is typically made with plain radiography. Characteristic radiographic findings include a relatively homogenous lucent lesion with or without bone expansion commonly described as a ground-glass appearance. Additionally the lucent lesion has a thick sclerotic border that is called the rind sign. There should be an absence of periosteal reaction. CT is commonly used to assess complex areas such as the spine, pelvis, chest and craniofacial bones. CT is very useful in evaluating the extent of disease in these complex areas. Nuclear imaging may also be used in conjunction with other imaging modalities to assist with the diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia. However nuclear imaging is not specific for fibrous dysplasia. Needle biopsy can be used to confirm the diagnosis if there is uncertainty.

Asymptomatic patients do not require treatment. Bisphosphonates have been shown to be helpful treating chronic bone pain associated with fibrous dysplasia. Surgical treatment is indicated for the treatment and prevention of pathologic fractures. Surgery may also be utilized for the treatment of severe deformity.
