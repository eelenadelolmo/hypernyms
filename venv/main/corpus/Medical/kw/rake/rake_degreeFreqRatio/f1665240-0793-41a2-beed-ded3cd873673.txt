Pre-operative embolization to help control blood loss during the subsequent surgery.  The patient went to the OR for surgical excision the day after embolization in the IR suite. 

The evening of embolization, there was no elevation of lipase or amylase to suggest non-target embolization of the pancreas.   

Surgical pathology demonstrated papillary renal cell carcinoma with extension into branches of the renal vein.  There was no evident extension into the pancreas.
1. CT demonstrates a 9 x 10 x 9 cm mass arising from the left kidney which abuts the posterior wall of the stomach and the tail of the pancreas.

2. MR shows large heterogeneous left renal mass.  There is no clear invasion of adjacent structures.

3. Angiography demonstrates 2 left renal arteries.  Additionally, a branch of the pancreaticoduodenal artery supplies the inferior aspect of the left renal mass.  All three arteries were successfully embolized.

Angiomyolipoma
54 year-old woman with intermittent abdominal pain and a feeling of 'fullness.'
While the presence of 2 renal arteries supplying one kidney is not unusual, the renal cell carcinoma in this patient was also supplied by a branch of the pancreaticoduodenal artery.  

This may be due to parasitization of blood supply from organs adjacent to the tumor, a not uncommon phenomena.

All three arteries were successfully embolized without pre-operative damage to the pancreas.
