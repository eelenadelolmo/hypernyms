Non-localizing neurologic exam
• Large central, heterogeneous mass involving the bifrontal lobes withsurrounding edema.  
• The lesion itself demonstrates multiple apparent cysticregions some with fluid levels with diffuse heterogeneous enhancement.  
• Portions of the anterior cerebral artery course through portions of thislesion. 
• Glioblastoma is the diagnosis of exclusion, although an aggressive oligodendroglioma or hemorrhagic metastasis are not entirely excluded
Glioblastoma Multiforme (Diffuse astrocytoma grade 4)
• Diffuse Astrocytoma High grade (Gr 4 - glioblastoma)
• Oligodendroglioma
• Oligoastrocytoma
• Primary CNS Lymphoma
51 y.o. man with severe headache for four days
• Clinical manifestations (in WHO Grade III-IV lesions)(1)
» Headache 53-57%
» Seizure 56% vs  23%
» Misc neuro deficits (amnesia, motor weakness) >20%

• Primary management is resection
» Survival is poor -  mean 12-15 mos (2)
» 5yr survival around 15% (2)
