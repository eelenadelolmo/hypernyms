Craniotomy with resection of tumor
• Ultrasound - large echogenic intraventricular mass
• MRI - Large  intraventricular lesion with some blood components, in the frontal horn of the left lateral ventricle.

Incidentally noted left middle fossa arachnoid cyst and partial agenesis of left temporal lobe
Intraventricular juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma
• Gliosarcoma
• Choroid plexus papilloma
• Ependymoma
• Teratoma
• Cerebral Neuroblastoma
Newborn male with abnormal prenatal ultrasound.
This lesion was diagnosed on pre-natal sonograms.  Intra ventricular juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas are unusual but not rare.  Prenatal  brain tumors are rare, and are usually choroid plexus neoplasms, teratomas, or PNET's.
