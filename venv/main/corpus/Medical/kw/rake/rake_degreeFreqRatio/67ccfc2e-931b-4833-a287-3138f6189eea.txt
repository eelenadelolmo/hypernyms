Afebrile.  Enlarged and tender uterus on bimanual examination.
Hormonal control.  Surgical resection may be neccessary if excessive enlargement of the endometria occurrs (greater than 6 cm).
Ultrasound images demonstrate a 2.9 cm x 2.7 cm x 2.6 cm rounded hypoechoic structure within the left ovary.  This structure demonstrates homogeneous low-level internal echoes with increased through transmission.

This structure appears hyperintense in T1-weighted images and displays heterogenous "shading," or loss of signal intensity of T2-weighted images.  This structure does not "saturate out" on fat suppressed sequences and does not enhance with Gadolinium.  A surrounding hemosiderin ring is present.
Endometrioma
The Differential diagnosis from the ultrasound would include the majority of the differential for a complex cystic mass in the female pelvis:

Endometrioma
Cystadenoma /Cystadenocarcinoma
Hydrosalpinx
Pyosalpinx
Ectopic pregnancy
Cystic Dermoid
Tubovarian abscess / Torsion of the Ovary
Hemorrhagic cyst
Abscess from adjacent structures (Appendix, diverticula...)
Thirty nine-year-old female with history of endometriosis and left adnexal pain.
