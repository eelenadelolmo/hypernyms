mild crackles bilateral lung bases
Steroids and azathioprine therapy just initiated. No follow-up as of yet.
Initial chest radiographs interpreted as normal. Subsequent chest radiographs 3 months later showed bibasilar interstitial opacities. 
High resolution chest CT revealed predominantly mid and lower lung zone ground-glass opacities and prominent but not enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonitis
Interstitial pneumonitis to include nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis.
pneumocytis carinii pneumonia
non tuberculous mycobacterial infection
pulmonary alveolar proteinosis
Worsening chronic cough and mild dyspnea.
No underlying etiology for this patient's interstitial lung disease was identified. A subclinical collagen vascular disease is speculated.
