Conservative management with orthopaedic follow up.
PA and lateral radiographs of the left knee demonstrate an abnormal linear thin sclerotic line at the medial aspect of the intertorchanteric portion of the left femur as well as a joint effusion.  Sagital and coronal T2 fat suppressed images demonstrate diffuse high T2 signal in the bone marrow consistent with edema in the distal femoral metaphysis and proximal tibial plateau.  Additionally on the coronal T1 sequences there is an abnormal linear region of low signal extending from the joint space to the epiphysis at the intertrochanteric region of the femur.  Additionally there is slight assymetric widening of the physis medially.  These findings are consistent with a Salter Harris type III fracture of the distal femur.
