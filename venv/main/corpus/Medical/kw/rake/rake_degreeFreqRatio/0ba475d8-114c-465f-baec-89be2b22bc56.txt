Right facial swelling.  Otherwise, unremarkable.
Unknown
- Ultrasound images of the face demonstrate a heterogeneous 3cm solid mass with internal flow just anterior to the ear.
- MRI demonstrates a T2 bright, enhancing mass in the location of the right parotid gland.
- Tc-99m MDP bone scan shows focal radiotracer accumulation within the left upper quadrant of the abdomen and the right parotid gland.
- Contrast enhanced CT images through the abdomen reveal a large, heterogeneously-enhancing mass within the left suprarenal region causing mass effect on, but not arising from, the left kidney.
- I-123 MIBG scan shows radiotracer accumulation within the left upper quadrant of the abdomen and the right parotid gland.

18 month old female presenting with right facial swelling.
This case demonstrates an uncommon presentation of neuroblastoma as a parotid mass.  The patient initially presented because her mother noted the facial swelling.  Initial ultrasound was followed by MRI.  An FNA of the mass was performed revealing neuroblastoma.  Subsequent work-up included a bone scan, which revealed radiotracer accumulation within the left upper quadrant consistent with the left retroperitoneal mass later seen on CT.  There was no evidence of bony metastases.  Finally, an MIBG scan was performed confirming the known left adrenal and right parotid masses, with no other areas of abnormal uptake identified.
