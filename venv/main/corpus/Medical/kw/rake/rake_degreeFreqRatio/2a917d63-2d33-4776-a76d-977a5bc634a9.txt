Texto: 
Temp 37.9, HR 120, RR 60-70, BP not obtained, O2 sat 92%. Patient is alert, interactive, nontoxic but is in some mild distress.
HEENT: TM clear bilaterally, audible nasal congestion and clear/white mucus bilateral nares, throat clear, mucus membranes moist
CV: regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops
Pulm: mild expiratory wheeze bilateral, transmitted coarse upper airway sounds with scattered rhonchi, mild subcostal retrations bilaterally
GI: soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds
GU: normal male
Ext: warm, dry, well perfused, 2+ distal pulses, 2 sec capillary refill
The patient was admitted to the inpatient service. He received supportive treatment with frequent suctioning, especially before meals. He also received continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring and oxygen via nasal canula as needed to keep his oxygen saturation greater than 92%. He also received maintenance intravenous fluids until his tolerance of oral feedings improved.
PA and lateral views of the chest reveal the following: heart size is normal, lungs hyperinflated bilaterally with increased, prominent peribronchial markings bilaterally. Small atelectasis evident bilateral lower lobes. No pleural effusion or focal consolidation is evident.
RSV+ Bronchiolitis
-RSV+ Bronchiolitis
-RSV- Bronchiolitis
-Pneumonia
The patient is a 6 week old male who presents with a three day history of cough, congestion, and wheezing. The patient intially did have some improvement in his symptoms, but subsequently developed worsening congestion. He also developed increased work of breathing at home and his parents thought they saw retractions. He had no fevers, vomiting, or diarrhea. His oral intake has been decreased and he has also had decreased urine output.
