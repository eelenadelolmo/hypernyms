Conservative management.
Radiographs of the shoulder demonstrate soft tissue calcification in the expected course of the supraspinatus tendon.  Additionally there is a focal rounded area of increased density at the greater tuberosity.  T1 and T2 fat saturated MR images demonstrate a focal rounded area of decreased signal at the greater tuberosity.
Hydroxyapatite deposition disease (calcific tendonitis) with osseous involvement
Calcific tendonitis with osseous extension.
Bone island of the humerus.
Sclerotic Metastatic disease
70 year old gentleman with  worsening shoulder pain and decreased range of motion.
This case demonstrates the importance of plain films when evaluating shoulder pain.  The MR images demonstrate a low signal lesion on T1 and T2 images within the humeral head, but the calcification within the distal supraspinatus is not as apparent as on the plain films.  This can lead to confusion with a possible neoplasm of the humeral head if plain film correlation is not made, and only advanced imaging is performed.
