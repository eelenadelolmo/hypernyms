Surgical resection.
There is a very large, well circumscribed 26 X 23 X 23 cm mass occupying a majority of the intraperitoneal cavity and which causes mass effect on adjacent structures such as bowel and abdominal aorta. There are a few scattered central areas of low attenuation within this mass which have average Hounsfield values of approx -40HU.
