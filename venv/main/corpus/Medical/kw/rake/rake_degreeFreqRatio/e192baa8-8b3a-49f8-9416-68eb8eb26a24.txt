Unremarkable
Treatment (pleural plaques): None.  

Follow-up: Continued follow-up and surveillance to screen for malignant mesothelioma.

CT is certainly indicated when:  Thick (>1 cm), lobulated contour, diffuse pleural thickening, associated pleural effusion, or evidence of adjacent chest wall/mediastinal extension are all suspicious for malignant mesothelioma.  Malignant mesotheliomas have calcifications in 20% and, unlike benign pleural disease, are not asbestos dose related.
CXR (PA/LAT): serpiginous, geographic calcified densities are scattered over both hemithoraces consistent with pleural plaques.
Asbestos-related pleural disease---pleural plaques
Given the appearance: multiple and bilateral (and given history of asbestos exposure), a differential is limited to Asbestos-related pleural disease.

Other differential causes for pleural calcification/thickening could be related to TB (prior exudative effusion), hemothorax (any cause).
73 y/o male with history of asbestos exposure.  Otherwise asymptomatic.
Pleural plaques can be followed radiographically, however, CT is much more sensitive in defining and characterizing these plaques.
