non contributory
None at this time
â€¢ MRA  No signal in the left vertebral artery
â€¢ CTA  Flow in left vertebral artery, but associated with occlusion of left subclavian artery at its origin from the aortic arch
â€¢ Distal reconstitution of flow from the cranial circulation
Subclavian Steal Syndrome
None
70 year old woman presents with dizziness (vertigo)
MRA of revealed absent signal in left vertebral artery due to reversal of flow and not occlusion.  This is a potential pitfall in MR angiography.

Patency of the left vertebral artery was confirmed by CTA; and the proximal occlusion at the origin of the left subclavian artery was demonstrated.
