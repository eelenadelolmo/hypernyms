He is 5‚Äô10‚Äù tall and he weighs 188 lbs.  Blood pressure of the right arm in the seated position was 130/90 mmHg.  
Active range of motion of the cervical spine revealed flexion to be performed to 50¬∞/50¬∞, right rotation to 50¬∞/80¬∞, left rotation to 57¬∞/80¬∞, left lateral bending to 28¬∞/45¬∞, right lateral bending each to 29¬∞/45¬∞ and extension to 17¬∞/60¬∞. John reports having neck and left upper extremity pain during left neck rotation.  He reported neck and left shoulder pain during left lateral bending and posterior neck pain during extension.  The bicep and tricep reflexes were graded 2/4 bilaterally.  Active range of motion of the shoulders were within normal limits.  Muscle strength in the right upper extremities was 5/5 and 4/5 in the left.  Grip strength was tested using a Jamar dynamometer. The right hand tested to 80 lbs and the left hand to 45 lbs.
Active range of motion of the lumbar spine revealed flexion to be performed to 21o/60o with report of lower back and left lower extremity pain extending to toes. Left lateral bending was 10o/25o and right lateral bending 11o/25o with subjective report of lower back pain. Extension was accomplished to 7o/25o with report of lower back pain.  The subpatellar and Achilles reflexes were graded 2/4 bilaterally.  He was able to toe walk, heel walk and squat.  Muscle strengths of the flexor and extensor halluces revealed the left extensor to be weak graded 4/5.  The straight leg raise on the left side could be performed to 52 degrees with report of lower back and left lower extremity pain to his toes. The right straight leg raise on the right side could be performed to 50 degrees with report of lower back and left lower extremity pain to his toes.
Plan: Continue Chiropractic care as approved by insurance company, including cervical traction, manipulation diathermy and core strengthening exercises.
CT findings:
Bilateral pars interarticularis defect noted at the L5 vertebral body consistent with spondylolisthesis

MRI findings:
-straightening of the normal lordosis of the lumbar spine
-L2-3: left lateral herniation of the nucleus polposus with effacement of the anterior margin of the left L2 nerve root
-L3-4: right lateral herniation of the nucleus polposus of the protrusin type with mild effacement of the anterior margin of the right L3 nerve root
L4-5: central herniation of the nulcleus polposus of the protrusino typr effacing the thecal sac without stenosis
L5-S1: Grade 1 spondylolisthesis with findings suggesting bilateral spondylolysis of the L5 pars interarticularis. broad bulge of the annulus with effacement of the exiting L5 nerve roots within the foramina, greater on the left than the right. no canal stenosis.
Lumbar Radiculopathy in the Presence of Disc Herniation and Spondylolisthesis
-Cauda Equina syndrome
-Pyriformis syndrome
-Osteophytes due to spinal Osteoarthritis
-Degenerative disc disease
-Foraminal stenosis
-Bony metastases to the spine
Patient is a 48 year old (DOB 08/27/1963) male who first presented to the office on 06/17/2000 complaining of pain in his cervical spine, lumbar spine and both knees, with left greater than right. He presented after being involved in a physical altercation 3 days earlier where he was pushed and shoved after which he began feeling the pains mentioned above. Pain after chiropractic treatment for 7 years was rated 3-4/10

Patient then presented on 07/19/2007 with pain in his neck, right elbow, and low back after sustaining a fall in the lavatory. This pain was rated 9-10/10. Patient also reported numbness in his right foot as well as in his left arm extending down to his wrist. Numbness was especially severe on the dorsal aspect of the left forearm. Additionally he reported numbness in his left lower extremity extending down to his toes. He also complains of chronic headaches. 

Prior to patient‚Äôs presentation on 06/14/2000 he had no significant past medical history and suffered only from seasonal allergies for which he takes Claritin.

Patient complains of passive and active pain in his cervical and lumbar spine. He has left sided radiculopathy of both the upper and lower extremities. Additionally he complains of numbness in his left upper extremity.
CASE CONTRIBUTORS:Rachel Bernstein, Geoffrey Gerow, D.C., Joanna Garvey, D.C., Krishnan Kartha, M.D., Joseph Serghany, M.D., Gregg Feld, M.D 

This patient was unique in that he likely had both a genetic predisposition for spinal problems as well as multiple episodes of physical trauma in his life both of which contributed to his lumbar radiculopathy due to disc herniation and spondylolisthesis.
