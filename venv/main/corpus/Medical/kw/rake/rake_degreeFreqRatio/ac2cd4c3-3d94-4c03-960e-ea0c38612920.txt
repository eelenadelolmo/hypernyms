Pain over medial wrist
Patient referred to orthopedic surgery
Four view wrist radiographs (PA, oblique, lateral, and dedicated navicular view) demonstrate widening of the scapholunate (SL) interval from SL ligament tear and near 90-degree SL angle.  The lunate bone is also subluxed ventrally with the long axis vector of the lunate pointing dorsally.
