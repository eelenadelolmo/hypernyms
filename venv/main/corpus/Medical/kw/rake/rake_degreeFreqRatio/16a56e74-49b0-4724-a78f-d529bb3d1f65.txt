Non specific (ECG) abnormalities
Sinus rhythm 
Normal Cardiac Enzymes
Follow up with pediatric cardiologist and treated with Lamotrigine 100, Celexa 20, and Strattera 18.
• Origin of coronary arteries in 180 degree opposition
• Right aortic arch with mirror image branching and right-sided ligamentum
• Pulmonary outflow  is moderately dilated
The right ventricle is moderately dilated.
Repaired Tetralogy of Fallot
panic attack
arrythmia
ischemia
This 27 year old woman was admitted to the hospital after two episodes of chest pain and questionable syncope en route to the hospital. Past medical history includes panic attacks, anxiety, and tetralogy of Fallot. Past surgical history includes Blalock-Taussig shunt placement prior to complete TOF repair at 4 1/2 years of age, pulmonary valve replacement, and right ventricular aneurysm outflow tract patch.
The patient is status post repair of membranous VSD, patch repair of the pulmonary outflow tract, and a prosthetic tissue valve in the pulmonic position.

Her symptoms were determined to be psychological in nature
