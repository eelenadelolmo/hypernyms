Crackles at the bases.
Supportive therapy. Patients may require transfusion for acute chest syndrome.
The PA chest radiograph demonstrates airspace disease in the lower lung field posteriorly as well as stigmata of sickle cell disease to include an enlarged heart, surgical clips in the gallbladder fossa, sclerosis and flattening of the left humeral head. The lateral view demonstrates "H-shaped" vertebral bodies with endplate depressions.
Peumonia vs acute chest syndrome. Stigmata of sickle cell disease on the chest radiograph.
Pneumonia vs acute chest syndrome. Stigmata of sickle cell disease.
9-year-old male with sickle cell disease and cold symptoms.
In pediatric patients with symptoms of pneumonia it is wise to look for stigmata of sickle cell disease as acute chest syndrome may need to be included in the differential diagnosis of acute infiltrates.
