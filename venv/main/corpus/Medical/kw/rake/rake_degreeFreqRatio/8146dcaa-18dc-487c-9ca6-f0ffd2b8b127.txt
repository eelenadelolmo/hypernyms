The primary medications used post-stroke are aspirin, coumadin, and clopidogrel for stroke prophylaxis.   Depending on the severity and origin of the stroke, carotid endartarectomy, angioplasty and intralumenal stents, or extracranial-intracranial bypass may be considered.
MRI–brain: Diffusion-weighted images – Increased signal intensity involving L insular cortex and adjacent operculum.  FLAIR and T2-weighted images – Increased signal intensity throughout L corona radiate w/ volume loss of the L frontal and parietal lobes.  Large wedge-shaped region of encephalomalacia in the lateral R frontal lobe possibly secondary to prior infarct. 
MRA-brain: Severe near occlusion of ICAs bilaterally, normal appearance of vertebral and basilar arteries.  
Dopper U/S-Carotids: R ICA completely occluded within a centimeter past bifurcation, L ICA – Very high resistance, abnormal flow at origin, possibly due to clot or very, very slow flow just above bifurcation

Cerebral infarcts (strokes) are either ischemic or hemorrhagic in origin.  Ischemia is responsible for two-thirds of strokes, while hemorrhage causes about one-third.  CT or MRI provide a more definitive diagnosis than simply the history or clinical symptoms.  
   Ischemic strokes can be caused by thrombosis or embolism.  Thrombosis more commonly occludes larger cerebral arteries, such as the ICAs, MCA or basilar artery, or the venous system.  These are generally preceded by TIAs, which give warning of an impending stroke and its affected territory.  The symptoms generally progress over minutes to hours.  Embolism usually occurs when thrombi pass to distal cerebral arteries from larger vessels such as the heart, aorta, or large cerebral arteries.  The symptoms at presentation usually do not progress further.   Hemorrhagic strokes can result in destruction or compression of brain tissue or vessels that then cause neurologic symptoms.  Some common causes are intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or subdural or epidural hemorrhage. 
   A patient who suffers from a cerebral infarct often has co-morbid conditions, broadly broken down into vascular, cardiac and hematologic disorders.  Common vascular disorders are atherosclerosis, inflammatory disorders (e.g., SLE, temporal arteritis) and migraines.  Arrhythmias, endocarditis, and rheumatic heart disease can lead to strokes.  Like this patient, sickle cell disease and hypercoagulable states can also result in strokes.
   The middle cerebral artery is the most commonly occluded vessel in an ischemic stroke.  A stroke of the superior division will result in contralateral hemiparesis affecting the upper body (but not the legs), contralateral hemisensory deficit and if the dominant hemisphere is involved, Broca’s aphasia.  An inferior division stroke may result in cortical sensory function impairment such as contralateral graphesthesia and stereognosis and disorders of spatial thought.  In the dominant hemisphere, Wernicke’s aphasia may occur.  A stroke at the bifurcation or trifurcation will have superior and inferior divisional symptoms, plus homonymous hemianopia and global aphasia.  Finally, an occlusion of the stem of the MCA will logically be the most devastating, as it can cause hemiparesis of the entire contralateral side.
