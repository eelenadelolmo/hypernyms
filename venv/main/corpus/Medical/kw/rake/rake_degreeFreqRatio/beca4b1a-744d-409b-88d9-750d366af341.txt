Axial CT’s of the head without contrast demonstrate 2 focal areas of hyperdensity with a central and surrounding hypodensity.  A significant midline shift is evident with effacement of the right lateral ventricle and entrapment of the left lateral ventricle.   
Axial T1 PG images show the lesions to be hyperintense, and well defined, with a surrounding hypointensity.   Again, significant mass effect is noted.  
Axial T2 FSE images demonstrate the lesions to be iso- to hypointense, with marked surrounding hyperintensities that is similar in intensity to CSF.
