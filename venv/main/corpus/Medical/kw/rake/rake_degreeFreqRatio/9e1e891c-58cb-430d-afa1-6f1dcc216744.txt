Marked pelvic/lower abdominal pain
Low grade fever
No overt lab abnormalities
Patient underwent emergent surgery revealing a dusky appearing, torsed right ovary. The ovary was detorsed, vascular flow was achieved, and the ovary was saved.
Pelvic ultrasound reveals a markedly enlarged right ovary, heterogeneous in echotexture, with no discernable vascular flow.
Ovarian Torsion
Ovarian Torsion
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome
32 year old female, currently on Clomid for fertility, presents with acute onset lower pelvic pain.
This patient had been on Clomid which had caused bilateral enlargment of the ovaries due to stimulation. There is a reported increased risk of torsion due to the large size.
