Normal laboratory evaluation.
Afebrile.

No treatment.  No additional imaging was performed.
Contrast enhanced CT shows non-enhancing fatty infiltration of the right sided omental fat.  The appendix is normal (not shown).  No colonic wall abnormalities.
Segmental Omental Infarct
Segmental Omental infarct 
Diverticulitis
Epiploic appendagitis
Chronic omental infection
Mesenteric panniculitis 
Omental neoplasm
Acute onset of abdominal pain today with no fever, emesis, diarrhea or trauma.  No significant past medical history.
In addition to the comments made in the factoid, one should note that surgery is not a treatment for segmental omental infarct.  Histologic diagnosis is therefore very rare.  Most patients have no follow-up imaging.
