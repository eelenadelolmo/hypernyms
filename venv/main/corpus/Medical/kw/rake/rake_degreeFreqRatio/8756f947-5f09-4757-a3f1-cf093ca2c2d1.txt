V/S unremarkable.  VA in OS eye- could not be tested with snellen but appeared able to see small pictured objects.
L periorbital area: noted to have a large mass as noted in attached picture.  The orbit was filled with gauze.  
Neuro: CN exam- I not tested.  II in OS eye grossly unremarkable. III, IV, VI in OS eye unremarkable.  V, VII- sensation absent over mass lesion.  Able to wrinkle forehead bilaterally.  Smile symmetrical.
VIII, IX, X- R ear was occluded with cerumen with some involvement of the mass of the anterior ear canal.  Tongue and palatal movement unremarkable.
A/P Squamous Cell CA vs basal Cell CA vs Melanoma vs ?  We had the XX transport the patient to the local hospital, but the patient states he has already been there and was told there was nothing that could be done.  Due to the vacularity in a CA lesion, I suspect that any debulking surgery would meet high morbidity and mortality.
It appears that the lids are consumed by a diffusely infiltrative neoplastic process, with areas of marked thickening, ulceration and necrosis, giving the appearance of a rodent ulcer.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Squamous cell carcinoma
Basal cell carcinoma
Primary Melanoma

optic nerve tumor (glioma)
meningioma, Schwannoma, Neurofibroma
lacrimal tumors etc, vs metastatic lesion (smoker? Lung) Paranasal sinus tumor invasion.

Lower on the ddx: sebaceous cell carcinoma, other adenocarcinoma, granular cell tumor, langerhans histiocytosis, fibrous histiocytoma, granulocytic sarcoma, myeloma, osteosarcoma, sarcoidosis, amyloid nodular, hemangiopericytoma.
A 60+ y/o male with an left periorbital mass.  With the use of a medical interpreter, I slowly was able to collect a basic history. Approximately 12 to 18 months prior to presentation, the patient states he had a "small bump around his left eye".  Due to poor medical resources in XX, the patient states he traveled to YY where he had surgery.  His eye was surgically removed and he stated, "no cancer".  He returned to XX from YY and states the small lesion slowly grew into what was noted on exam today.  The lesion bleeds, but is minimally painful.  He states he has been having progressively worsening right sided temporal headaches.

1st Ophthalmologist&#39;s Recommendation / Dx

It looks like advanced squamous cell carcinoma (less likely basal cell carcinoma. Given the advanced stage it is likely that it has metastasized. It could be debulked, but there is no curative surgery. He could try chemotherapy, but the chances for success are slim.

If it is basal cell CA it rarely metastasizes and he could have MOHS surgery to remove the tumor.   I would take a generous biopsy and send it to pathology. If it is squamous cell CA I would refer to palliative care. If it is basal cell Ca then he could be referred to oculoplastics and have surgery.

1st Dermatologist’s Recommendation / Dx

I agree with Dr. XX. We need a biopsy first. Do you have any imaging capabilities at your camp, or access somewhere to get a CT of the head? Depending on the bx results, a CT may be helpful.

I think SCC and primary Melanoma are very high on the differential along with BCC; I&#39;d also include lymphoma/leukemia, leiomyosarcoma/leiomyoma, optic nerve tumor, meningioma, Schwannoma, Neurofibroma, lacrimal tumors etc, vs metastatic lesion (smoker? Lung) or paranasal sinus tumor invasion.

Lower on the ddx: sebaceous cell carcinoma, other adenocarcinoma, granular cell tumor, langerhans histiocytosis, fibrous histiocytoma, granulocytic sarcoma, myeloma, osteosarcoma, sarcoidosis, amyloid nodular, hemangiopericytoma.

I agree it will be filled with blood vessels feeding this growth, (but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a cavernous hemangioma, AVM, or lymphangioma; or any benign cystic lesion.) I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an infectious mass either.

Based on the bx results, as Dr XX suggested, he can be sent to oculoplastics or Mohs (Dr XXcc&#39;d above).

If you get a bx, please forward the results to me.

2nd Ophthalmologist&#39;s Recommendation / Dx

This is a very unfortunate case, that I will agree with you on...very little to do other than palliative.

From the foto, it appears that the lids are consumed by a diffusely infiltrative neoplastic process, with areas of marked thickening, ulceration and necrosis, giving the appearance of a rodent ulcer. In the US this would most typically be a basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell ca. In your region, sebaceous cell ca is also very prevalent and may actually be more common than either bcc or scc. I suspect the orbit proper is probably full of tumor as well

The temporal headaches are concerning and worrisome for perineural spread, which would lead to intracranial extension.

The clinical foto is discouraging  enough, but the required imaging is CT to evaluate unseen extent.

These would be challenging cases even here, and would inevitably require orbital exenteration (possibly including bone removal) and radiation. The surgical team would typically involve oculoplastics, neurosurgery, and ent. I&#39;m not sure you have the capacity for that level of care even at the american role 3&#39;s.
