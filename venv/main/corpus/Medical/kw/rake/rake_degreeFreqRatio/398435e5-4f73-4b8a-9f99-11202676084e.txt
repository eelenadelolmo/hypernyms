Type II endoleaks are a result of flow from small arteries such as the lumbars or the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). Detection of a type II endoleak can be accomplished by routine duplex ultrasound, but is more commonly performed by CT scanning. Both methods have some disadvantages; however, the most serious problem is related to CT scanning. The timing of contrast injection during the CT scan will determine whether a type II endoleak is visible. Due to the nature of retrograde flow, these can be very low-flow systems. Delayed films may be necessary to assess late perfusion within the sac and should be performed with any suspicion of type II endoleak.
Axial computed tomography images demonstrate 2 collateral vessels in the aneurysm sac on each side. This is consistent with retrograde filling by these vessels and constitutes the presence of a Type 2 endograft Leak.
Endograft Leak - type II involving the L3 lumbar artery and inferior mesenteric artery.
None. This finding is very specific for a type II endograft leak.
59 year old Black male with long-standing history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes who was found to have an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. The patient underwent an endograft repair 10 days prior to CT scan. The CT scan was ordered for routine post-operative evaluation.
Interventionalists debate the significance of type II endoleaks, as many of these leaks will spontaneously resolve, regardless of graft type. 
Some patients will demonstrate stability or even shrinkage of the aneurysm sac in the presence of a patent type II endoleak; usually they can be safely observed for 6 months. 
An aggressive approach to treating all persistent endoleaks at 6 months is usually adopted and consideration of further conservative treatment only when a type II endoleak is difficult to treat and the aneurysm sac is shrinking in size. 
It should be noted that most type II endoleaks have a benign course and aggressive treatment should not involve excessive patient morbidity. 
In this setting, successful embolization performed via transarterial or translumbar techniques can be peroformed by a skilled interventionalist as clinically required.
