Texto: 
Physical exam unremarkable.  No labs were drawn at the time of exam.
Patient recovered well on a broad spectrum antibiotics.
Noncontrast images of the head demonstrate air in the subarachnoid space ventral to the brainstem and midbrain.  Acute inflammatory changes of the paranasal sinuses are seen.  Decreased volume of the CSF containing spaces - relative to the patient's age - was suggested due to subtle sulcal effacement that is best appreciated on the superior-most images.  Subsequent fine-cut images revealed dehiscence of the dorsal aspect of the sphenoid sinus.
Pneumocephalus and meningitis secondary to sinusitis
Pneumocephalus and meningitis secondary to sinusitis.
45 year old woman presents to the ER with a headache.  No history of trauma or recent procedure/intervention.
The inital head CT findings were discussed with the ER physician and a lumbar puncture was recommended.  The CSF analysis revealed:
Turbid CSF
WBC - 3300
glucose- 25
protein- 333
gram stain- many gram positive cocci in pairs

Subsequently,a CT of the paranasal sinuses was performed, revealing dehiscence of the dorsal aspect of the sphenoid sinus and suggesting acute paranasal sinus disease as the etiology for the patient's pneumocephalus and meningitis.
