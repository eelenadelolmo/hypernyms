Enlarged hyperechoic renal echotexture (in relation to liver and spleen) with hypoechoic renal pyramids
Rhabdomyolysis
1.Acute / chronic glomerulonephritis
2.Renal transplant rejection
3.Lupus nephritis
4.Hypertensive nephrosclerosis
5.Renal cortical necrosis
6.Methemoglobulinuric renal failure
7.Alport syndrome
8.Amyloidosis
9.Diabetic nephrosclerosis
10.Nephrotoxin-induced acute tubular necrosis*
11.End-stage renal disease
25 y/o WM in acute renal failure after intense exercise session
Imaging generally does not play a role in management of rhabdomyolysis, other than to rule out obstructive hydronephrosis and assess renal size.  

Although the imaging findings are non-specific, correlation with clinical history is the key to diagnosis.
