Texto: 
Early radiographic findings consist of under-aeration with fine granular opacities affecting the lungs diffusely and bilaterally.
Respiratory Distress Syndrome in a Newborn
Respiratory distress syndrome/surfactant deficient disease
Neonatal pneumonia
Transient tachypnea of the newborn
Meconium or clear amniotic fluid aspiration
History: This is an infant born at 26 weeks gestation. Soon after theinfant experienced respiratory distress and has been intubated on a ventilator since.
Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or surfactant deficient disease is manifest by diffuse, usually symmetric ground-glass opacities and small lung volumes. Air bronchograms may also be seen.The ground glass appearance is thought to be due to a combination of collapsed alveoli interspersed with dilated terminal bronchioli and alveolar ducts; however, with early application of therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure, the under-aeration may not be manifest. Positive pressure ventilationmay result in further distention of terminal airways producing a coarser, granular appearance.
