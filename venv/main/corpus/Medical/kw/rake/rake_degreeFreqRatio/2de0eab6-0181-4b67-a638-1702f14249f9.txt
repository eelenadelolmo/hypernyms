Right hand distally neurovascularly intact. Mild deformity, edema, and ecchymosis noted over 4th and 5th metacarpal.
A majority of metacarpal fractures are treated non-surgically with casting. Indications of surgery for a metacarpal shaft fracture after attempted closed reduction include shortening of shaft by greater than 3 mm, malrotation, multiple metacarpal fractures, greater than 10 degrees of angulation in 2nd and 3rd metacarpals, or greater than 20 degrees of angulation in 4th and 5th metacarpals. The patient should return to clinic every 2 weeks for recasting, re-examination and interval radiologic studies.
Noted right 5th non-displaced oblique midshaft metacarpal fracture with 10 degrees of dorsal angulation
Midshaft right 5th metacarpal fracture
1. contusion  2. fracture 3. collateral ligament injury
19 y/o male with right hand pain after striking brick wall.
Fractures of the metacarpals are the second most common fracture of the hand after the phalanges. Most metacarpal fractures are classified according to the anatomic locations: head, neck, shaft, or base. The goals in treatment of metacarpals fracture are to preserve the longitudinal and transverse arches and preventing rotational deformity. Angulation into flexion is not well tolerated by the metacarpals especially the second and third. As a general rule, the second and third digits can tolerate 10 degrees of flexion angulation, the 4th metacarpal 20 degrees of flexion angulation, and the 5th metacarpal can tolerate 30 degrees and flexion angulation. As mentioned above, most metacarpal fractures are treated non-surgically with casting. Indications for surgery include flexion angulation greater than the numbers above after closed reduction is attempted, malrotation, multiple metacarpal fractures, and shaft shortening greater than 3mm.
