Vermian hypoplasia, with 4th ventricle communicating dorsally with the cisterna magna. Posterior fossa is not enlarged and the torcula is not elevated above the lambda.
Dandy Walker Variant
Cystic lesions of the posterior fossa include: mega cisterna magna, arachnoid cysts, Dandy Walker Syndrome, and Dandy Walker Variant.
Young man with worsening seizure disorder and mental retardation.
There is an extreme range of severity with the Dandy Walker Complex. Some patients are asymptomatic while others suffer from developmental delay, seizures, enlarged head circumference, or signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus.  Dandy Walker is generally discovered on prenatal ultrasound.  This particular patient also suffered from tuberous sclerosis which was likely the more significant contributing factor to his symptomatology.
