Texto: 
Normal physical examination and laboratory findings.
Surgical myotomy is performed if required.
The length (17 mm) and muscle width (5 mm) are abnormally large and suggestive of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.
Hypertrophic Pyloric stenosis
Differential diagnosis:

-Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis
-Pyloric spasm
One month old male with frequent vomiting and lack of weight gain.
This patient had frequent projectile vomiting and was not gaining weight as expected. In addition to the imaging findings, administration of a small liquid meal of Pedialyte resulted in stomach peristalsis without passage through the pyloris.
