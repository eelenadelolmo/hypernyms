Tenderness to palpation and fullness in the right calf.

Normal neurological and motor examination of the bilateral lower extremities.
Treatment is usually conservative with analgesics and 4-8 weeks of decreased activity and potentially with splinting.
Figure 1
Axial T1 image shows curvilinear isointense signal between the medial head of the gastrocnemius and the soleus. 

Figure 2
Axial T2 Fat Suppressed image shows the high intensity signal between the medial head of the gastrocnemius and the soleus as well as edema within the medial head of gastrocnemius muscle. 

Figure 3
Coronal T2 image at a level between the gastrocnemius and the soleus muscles again shows the extent of this fluid collection between the two muscles.
Plantaris Tendon Tear
Plantaris Tendon Tear
42 year old radiologist complains of sudden onset pain after experiencing a popping sensation in the right calf while playing tennis.
The plantaris muscle, absent in 7-10% of the population, arises from the lateral supracondylar line of the distal femur just superior to the attachment of the lateral head of the gastrocnemius. The long thin muscle body lies just deep to the lateral head of the gastrocnemius coursing inferiorly a few inches before terminating in the plantaris tendon. The Plantaris tendon is unusually long and thin, coursing medially between the medial head of the gastrocnemius and the soleus, inserting on the calcaneus anterior and medial to the Achilles tendon insertion. The tendon may also insert into the distal Achilles tendon. 

The plantaris muscle and tendon (as well as the gastrocnemius) is more prone to injury than the soleus muscle likely because it traverses two joints rather than just one.  Injury is felt to be related to dorsiflexion under tension, frequently a problem for runners, cyclists, and tennis players.   

Plantaris muscle injuries have been described with anterior cruciate ligament and posterolateral corner knee injuries. Plantaris injury can be diagnosed confidently with MRI.  Findings include, increased T2 signal within the plantaris muscle or myotendinous junction, proximal retraction of the plantaris muscle body, fluid between the medial head of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, as well as associated injuries to other structures in the posterolateral compartment of the knee. 

Treatment is usually conservative with analgesics and 4-8 weeks of decreased activity and potentially with splinting.
