Burr hole drainage of the fluid collections and antibiotic therapy.
Bilateral pia-arachnoid (leptomeningeal) enhancement
Bilateral extra-axial enhancing collections
Brain parenchyma is normal
Hemophilus flu meningitis and subdural empyema
• meningitis 
• subdural hematomas
• child abuse
• subdural empyema vs. subdural effusion
5 month old boy presents with barking cough and fever.

Fever has worsened and patient has had a febrile seizure.
Subdural empyemas are often treated with surgical drainage, in addition to antibiotic therapy.  Craniotomy may be preferred over burr hole drainage.  PMID: 16902341

Diffusion weighted imaging and ADC maps will demonstrate restricted diffusion in empyema as compared to a more liquid effusion. PMID: 15205140
