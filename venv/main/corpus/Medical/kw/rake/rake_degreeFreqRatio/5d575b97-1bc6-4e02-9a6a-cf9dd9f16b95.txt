Surgical, medical, or radioablative management of thyroid for Graves disease.
Plain film possibilities include goiter of any cause, vascular malformation, neoplastic infiltration of thyroid or adjacent tissues.

CT shows smooth, extrinsic, symmetric tracheal narrowing, with homogeneous thyromegaly and normal thyroid attenuation.
Tracheal compression from Graves disease thyromegaly
On the basis of the plain film (only) possibilities include thyroiditis, goiter of any cause, hematoma, neoplastic infiltration of thyroid or adjacent tissues, or less likely, bronchogenic cyst or vascular malformation.

CT confirms diffuse enlargement of the thyroid
