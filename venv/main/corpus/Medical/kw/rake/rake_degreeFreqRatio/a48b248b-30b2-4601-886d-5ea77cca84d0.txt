Height is 121.6cm, weight is 22.9kg.  Patient appears very petite with normal appearing body proportions.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+. Thyroid function tests were normal.  Sexual development: tanner stage I.  Bone age performed at a chronological age of 9 years, 3 months was determined to be 8 years, 4 months.   IGF-1 was less than 20 and cortisol level drawn at 12:00pm was 9.5
Continue current thyroid hormone regimen and re-initiate treatment with growth hormone.
MRI of brain and sella with and without contrast revealed anterior pituitary height of less than 1mm
Empty Sella Syndrome
o	Pituitary hypoplasia
o	Prolactinoma
o	Pseudotumor cerebri
o	Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
8 year old female with a history of hypothyroidism and severe short stature.  She has been lost to follow-up for three years but was restarted on Synthroid three months ago.  Now she is being seen by endocrinologist for short stature.
There are a variety of clinical manifestations associated with ESS and definitive diagnosis is often delayed while patients undergo an extensive evaluation to determine the cause of their symptoms. Endocrine abnormalities are common; in this case, the patient presented with signs and symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism and growth hormone deficiency.
