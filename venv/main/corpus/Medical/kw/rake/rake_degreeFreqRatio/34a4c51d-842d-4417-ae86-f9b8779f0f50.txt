Patient is limping and is wearing a splint.  Area around 1st metatarsal swollen, but no evidence of sinus tract.  Pain is also reported with palpation at this site.
This patient was on dicloxacillin at the time of the initial bone scan.  After the bone scan, marrow scan and gallium scan were completed, she was placed on fluoroquinolone antibiotic therapy. A culture of the wound site grew out staph aureus.  She is being considered for surgical intervention.
The plain film demonstrates malunion at the surgical site, with resorptive osteolysis in this region.  There is diffuse osteopenia of the foot, with soft tissue swelling.  Some reparative bone formation is seen along the lateral shaft.
The initial bone scan utilizing Tc-99m MDP showed increased activity on flow, pool, and delayed images about the surgical site, with a slight activity differential between the proximal and distal portions of the 1st metatarsal. These findings are non-specific, as osteomyelitis or normal post-surgical changes could be responsible for this appearance.
The sulfur colloid bone marrow scan following the bone scan displays decreased marrow activity in the proximal 1st metatarsal, with increased activity in the distal 1st metatarsal, as well as the second metatarsal.  The increased activity can be explained by hyperemia adjacent to a site of inflammation, infection, or repair.  The decreased marrow activity suggests a replacement process, likely due to infection.
The gallium scans show an area of increased activity, with an increase in relative tracer uptake over time.  This pattern is highly suggestive of osteomyelitis.
Chronic Osteomyelitis
Osteomyelitis
Post-surgical changes
24 year old female with history of bunionectomy surgery for hallux valgus condition 2 1/2 months ago.  Patient has been plagued by continued pain at surgical site.  She is taking  dicloxacillin at time of radiograph displayed in this case.
Bone scans using Tc-99m MDP demonstrate increased activity at areas of increased osteoblastic activity.  Fractures, surgical sites, and infection can all appear similar using this modality.  In a post-surgical patient, differentiating a non-union from an infection is a common clinical problem.

Combining a bone scan with radio-labeled white blood cells can be utilized to detect infection.  Specificity can be a problem using labeled WBCs, as the leukocytes can accumulate at sites of infection and inflammation.  An inflammatory response is often seen in post-surgical patients, confusing interpretation (infection vs. normal post-surgical changes).  Tagging leukocytes is a time consuming and difficult process and is not avilable to many facilities. The sensitivity of labeled WBCs in detecting chronic osteomyelitis is reduced when compared to sensitivity regarding acute osteomyelitis.

Utilizing Tc-99m sulfur colloid as a means to detect osteomyelitis is an option that is somewhat simpler than tagged WBCs.  Sensitivity and specificity are on par with other nuclear medicine modalities, with one study listing sensitivity of detection of osteomyelitis at 90% and specificity at 92%.

Gallium scanning is also an effective means of detecting osteomyelitis, especially when combined with diphosphonate bone scans. Sensitivity of gallium scanning ranges from 81-100%, with specificity of 40-69%.

As discussed, there are multiple methods utilizing scintigraphy to detect osteomyelitis.  Most methods are sensitive, but specificity can be an issue.  Combining multiple types of scans can increase the specificity in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis.
