Surgical Resection with continued follow up to monitor for residual or recurrent tumor.
There is a smoothly marginated, extra-axial mass which is located along the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve and within Meckel’s cave on the right.  The mass measures approximately 1.4 cm AP x 1.1 cm Transverse x 1.5 cm craniocaudal.  The mass is isointense to brain on the T1 and T2 weighted sequences.  It has diffuse homogenous enhancement on the post gadolinium images.  The mass extends to foramen ovale on the right; but does not pass through.  There is minimal mass effect on the adjacent right temporal lobe.    There is atrophy and fatty infiltration of the muscles of mastication, ipsilateral to the mass lesion.

The patient presented with right sided facial pain and headaches.
The patient in this case presented with facial pain and headaches.  The main symptoms of trigeminal schwannomas are facial numbness, hyperesthesia, and pain.  Memory loss and seizures can also occur.  The trigeminal schwannoma in this case involved the cerebellopontine angle at the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve along the pons.  The tumor also involved Meckel’s cave.  It did not extend through the foramen of ovale.  Four distinct types of trigeminal schwannomas have been categorized.  The four categories include those confined to the cavernous sinus, those located within Meckel’s cave, those located within the cerebellopontine angle, and those that involve both the posterior and middle cranial fossa.  The tumor in this case fits into the last category where it is a giant trigeminal schwannoma involving both the posterior and middle cranial fossa.  

Trigeminal schwannomas are uncommon tumors that account for 0.07-0.36% of all intracranial tumors.  The peak incidence of trigeminal schwannomas occurs in the fourth decade of life which is consistent with the age at presentation for the patient in this case.  This tumor’s MRI signal characteristics were very typical for schwannomas. Schwannomas are typically isointense to hypointense on T1 weighted images, hyperintense on T2 weighted images, well circumscribed, and show strong enhancement.  Although this tumor did not have any cystic components, trigeminal schwannomas are more likely to contain cystic areas than Vestibular ("acoustic") schwannomas.   Pertinent anatomy for the trigeminal nerve is as follows:

The trigeminal nerve exits the brainstem at the mid-pons, passes through the cerebellopontine angle, and enters Meckel’s cave where the trigeminal ganglion (gasserian ganglion) is located.  The nerve then branches into three segments.  The mandibular nerve (V3) passes anteriorly through Meckel’s cave and exits inferiorly through the foramen of ovale into the infratemporal fossa.  The maxillary nerve (V2) enters the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus with the ophthalmic nerve (V1).  The maxillary nerve then exits the middle cranial fossa through the foramen rotundum and the ophthalmic nerve exits through the superior orbital fissure.
