A lobular lesion of intermediate signal intensity is centered at the level of the physeal scar in the distal femur.  The lesion has punctate areas of low signal consistent with calcifications, as well as interspersed areas of fat.  The appearance and location are typical for enchondroma.
Enchondroma
chronic knee pain
Enchondromas are common incidental findings on MR imaging studies performed to evaluate for internal derangement of the knee.
