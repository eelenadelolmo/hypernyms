The left ovary measured 2.7 x 2.4 x 2.1 cm.  There was a left adnexal mass inferior and medial to the left ovary.  It measured 6.4 x 2.4 x 2 cm.  It had cystic, solid, and calcific components.  There was no increased vascularity.
Dermoid cyst (Cystic Teratoma)
dermoid tumor (benign cystic teratoma)
germ cell tumors
epithelial tumors
metastases
40 y.o. female 10 months post-partum with a history of a left adnexal mass, probable dermoid, prior to pregnancy.  The patient was referred to Ultrasound for evaluation of the mass.  The patient had a right salpingo-oophorectomy previously for ovarian torsion.
This mass demonstrated the "tip of the iceberg" or "snowcapping" that is typical of the calcified components.
