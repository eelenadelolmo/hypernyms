Texto: 
Varus deformity of the right lower extremity.
The patient was referred to orthopedic surgery for further care. After worsening despite conservative management with bracing, the patient underwent corrective tibial osteotomy.
Standing plain frontal radiograph of the bilateral knees demonstrates varus angulation of the right knee.  There is depression and irregularity of the medial right tibia.  The medial tibial physis is poorly defined.  Additionally, beaking of the metaphysis is noted and the metaphyseal-diaphyseal angle is abnormally widened at 22 degrees.
