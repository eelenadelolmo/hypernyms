Vitals: Temp 38.4, BP 120/49, HR 119, RR 40, O2 sat 80%
General: female in acute respiratory distress
Pharynx: mild erythema of the oropharynx, slight tonsillar enlargement on the right
Neck: tender, palpable cord in right anterior neck with overlying erythema
Chest:  diffuse, coarse sounds bilaterally along with decreased breath sounds heard at bilateral bases

Labs: WBC 18.0, CRP 20.5, ABG pH of 7.45, PCO2 of 35, PO2 of 75, bicarb of 24
Blood cultures positive for Fusobacterium nucleatum
She was transferred from an outside hospital to a tertiary care center and admitted to the ICU.  Treatment included IV antibiotics and a heparin drip.  Blood cultures drawn grew Fusobacterium nucleatum.  She underwent surgical drainage of her peritonsillar abscess in addition to a right tonsillectomy.  Bilateral chest tubes were placed after thoracoscopic pleural decortications for empyemas bilaterally.

The patient continued to improve in the ICU over the next 5 days before transfer to the general medicine floor.  Upon discharge her anticoagulation was converted to enoxaparin as a bridge before beginning 6 months of warfarin therapy.  

The patient made a complete clinical recovery, but follow up CT of the neck demonstrated continued thrombosis of the right IJV.  It was decided that anticoagulation should be discontinued, as it was unlikely that the IJV would recanalize and there is no clinically significant sequelae from unilateral loss of the internal jugular vein.
â€¢ CT of the neck reveals a right peritonsillar abscess.  There is thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein and surrounding fat stranding with loss of the fatty plane.  Reactive adenopathy is noted bilaterally, right greater than left.  An endotracheal tube is present.

â€¢ CT of the chest reveals extensive, bilateral patchy airspace disease and a left loculated pleural empyema.

23 year-old woman without significant past medical history presents with 2 weeks of severe sore throat and general malaise.  She had a tooth extraction approximately 5 weeks prior to presentation.  She was treated with a 3-day course of azithromycin.
