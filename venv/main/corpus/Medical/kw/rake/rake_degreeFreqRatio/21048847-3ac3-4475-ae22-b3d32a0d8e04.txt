Texto: 
Mild tachycardia, low grade fever, dry oropharynx, left neck tenderness.

Elevated WBC, elevated liver function tests.

Blood cultures positive for Fusobacterium necrophorum.
High dose intravenous antibiotics targeting anaerobic organisms are indicated. Since beta-lactamase production by F. necrophorum and treatment failures with penicillin have been reported, a beta-lactamase resistant beta-lactam antibiotic is recommended for the treatment of this infection. Possibilities include ticarcillin-clavulanate (3.1 g IV Q4h) or imipenem (500 mg to 1 g Q6h). The duration of therapy generally is for at least four weeks or until pulmonary abscesses have resolved by CT scan.
Left tonsillitis with associated suppurative adenitis, left internal jugular vein thrombosis, multiple bilateral cavitary lung lesions and empyemas.
Lemierre's Syndrome
