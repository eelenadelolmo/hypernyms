Texto: 
Soft tissue swelling and tenderness over entire left thumb.
Lateral radiograph of the 1st digit demonstrates a Salter-Harris type 2 fracture of the dorsal aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx. The fracture was visualized well on one view only demonstrating the value of orthogonal views when evaluating bony structures for fractures.
Type II Salter-Harris fracture
None
12 year old boy riding his skateboard fell on the ground "smashing" his thumb.
The fracture was well visualized in one view only demonstrating the value of orthogonal views when evaluating bony structures for fractures.
