Negative except for mild generalized breast tenderness.
Reassurance; mild analgesic for pain and clinical follow-up to ensure that her problem resolves to baseline.

Routine imaging follow-up consists of screening mammography, only.  This should be performed once a year (she is 46).

She does not require, at any time, any imaging modality to assess the integrity of her single lumen saline containing implants.  When valve dysfunction or shell rupture occurs, the implant deflates and the saline is absorbed.  Imaging is reserved only for those cases in which the patient is suspected of having a breast parenchymal abnormality, or when infection of hemmorhage are thought to be likely.
Longitudinal image near 12:00.  There is wedge shaped collection of fluid (arrows) noted between the inner surface of the fibrous capsule and the surface of the shell of the implant (arrowheads).  The fluid is anechoic and can easily be displaced with increase of scanning pressure.
Normal peri-capsular reactive fluid
1.  Normal peri-capsular fluid seen in a patient with a textured surface breast implant.
2.  Normal standard double lumen implant.
3.  Normal pericapsular fluid contiguous to a polyurethane coated implant. 
4.  Infected pericapsular fluid.
5.  Hemorrhage into the percapsular space.
Breast pain for 2 weeks

Patient supplied a copy of the implant "tags" given to her by her plastic surgeon indicating that the implants are Mentor 354-2650
The diagnosis is: Normal peri-capsular reactive fluid adjacent to a single lumen, saline containing, textured surface breast implant.

The fact that the patient supplied the technical data about her implants ie, she brought copies of the 'tags' given to her by her plastic surgeon, made the diagnosis a trivial one.  We were able to look up the Mentor 354-2650 in our Breast Implant Catalog (an appendix on the CD that comes with the book "Breast Implant Imaging", and determine that her device is a single lumen saline containing textured surface implant.  Fluid collections, like the one here, are almost always noted when these implants are scanned.

As for the other elements in the differential:
This implant is not a standard double lumen-- the fluid is seen to be superficial to the shell (ie curvilinear shell separates the pericapsular fluid from the implant contents and the typical "step-off" sign is not preent.  Standard double lumen implants have saline in the outer lumen and silicone gel in the inner lumen. 

Polyurethane coated implants are associated with peri-capsular fluid that has diffuse medium level echoes within it.  The fluid here is anechoic.  Additionally, with experience, this implant's shell is thicker and has a coarser surface than is noted with a polyurethane coated implant.

Infection is a rare complication, but almost always occurs in the immediate post operative period.  If the fluid were infected we would not expect it to be anechoic, and, further, there would be sonographic evidence of edema in the soft tissues superficial to the fibrous capsule and the patient would be expected to have more substantial pain.

Finally, hemmorhage is also a rare complication and is usually in the immediate post implantation period.  Hemorrage would be characterized by a complex fluid collection in the pericapsular space.
