Bilateral palpable neck masses.
Left mass resected 1 month following MRI scan.
Right mass will be resected in early 2011
Enhancing masses originating from the carotid bodies bilaterally.  The masses splay the internal and external carotid arteries and contain flow voids.
Masses are hyperintense on T2 and low signal on T1 sequences.
Paraganglioma of the Head and Neck
• Paraganglioma
• Cervical Adenopathy
• Schwnnoma
• Neurofibroma
39 year old woman who has had bilateral neck masses for many years.  She now presents with dysphagia and weight loss.
This may be a familial syndrome, since this patient's sister has also been treated for bilateral carotid body paragangliomas.
