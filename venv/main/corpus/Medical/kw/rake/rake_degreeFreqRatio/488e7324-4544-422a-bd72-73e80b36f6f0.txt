Texto: 
Jaundiced, Benign Abdominal exam.
Elevated liver enzymes.
The mass was not resected given the extent of tumor and the patient's general state of health.
Marked dilitation of the intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ducts.  Distention of the Gall Bladder, without cholelithiasis.  Pancreatic duct dilatation.  Soft tissue mass (3cm x 3cm) involving the head of the pancreas and extends into the wall of the duodenum. The superior mesenteric vein does not appear to be involved.  No significant lymphadenopathy is apparent.  No obvious sites of metastases.
No definitive pathologic diagnosis.  Radiologic findings strongly suggestive for Pancreatic Carcinoma.
Extrahepatic biliary dilatation: 
Pancreatic CA, Obstructing calculus, Biliary ductal CA, Gall Bladder CA, Cholangiocarcinoma, duodenal hematoma, strictures, Hepatoma.

Pancreatic Mass: Pancreatic Carcinoma, Chronic pancreatitis, Islet cell CA, Mucinous Cystic tumor, pseudocyst, true cyst, abscess, trauma.
81 y/o male presents to ER with painless jaundice.
