No significant physical exam findings. Abdomen soft, non-tender, non-distended and no masses. No lymphadenopathy. Normal rectal exam.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis
 - Concentric wall thickening in the sigmoid colon
 - Diffuse abdominal and pelvic lymphadenopathy
 - Normal appearing appendix
 - Intra- and extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation
 - Narrowing of bilateral ureters with mild right-sided hydronephrosis
Colorectal Signet-Ring Carcinoma
- Colorectal Carcinoma 
 - Lymphoma
 - Inflammatory disorders (Crohn disease or Ulcerative colitis)
 - Ischemic colitis
29 year old man presented with intermittent diarrhea and abdominal pain. Stools were loose in consistency and occasionally with streaks of blood. Significant unintentional weight loss was reported going from the 160s to 137 lbs. No urinary complaints.
Colorectal signet ring carcinoma comprises only 0.1-2.4% of all colorectal carcinomas. It arises more often in younger populations. It also has a high propensity to spread to pelvic lymph nodes, ovaries, and peritoneal surfaces. Unlike other colorectal cancers, it is less likely to spread to the liver. It is an aggressive cancer and often recurs after treatment. The prognosis is poor. 

Radiologically, it typically lacks findings seen in ordinary colorectal carcinomas (intraluminal mass, mucosal ulceration, short segment involvement, & overhanging edges). It instead, gives the impression of an inflammatory lesion due to long segmental bowel wall thickening. It does often have a Target appearance in the thickened colorectal wall.
