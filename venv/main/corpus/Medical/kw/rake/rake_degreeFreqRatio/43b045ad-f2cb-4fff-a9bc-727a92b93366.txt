Mildly decreased sensation to touch in the upper extremities with no motor weakness. Normal balance, and vision with no current visual deficits.
The patient is currently on pharmacological therapy for Multiple Sclerosis. She has had a chronic, intermittant course, so far, and seems to be slightly progressing in symptomatology. She currently has no symptoms of optic neuritis.
Axial FLAIR MRI sequences demonstrate multiple small foci of increased signal intensity in the periventricular white matter which had increased in number compared to prior MRI performed four years prior. The left optic nerve was enlarged on the axial T2WI from 2001 consistent with the patients symptoms of left optic neuritis. The left optic nerve has normalized on the current examination with treatment and the symptoms of optic neuritis have resolved.
Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis, Lyme Disease, migraine headaches, vasculitis.
41 year old female who originally presented with left optic neuritis in 2001, and who was subsequently diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis presented to Neurology clinic with new bilateral arm numbness.
This case deomonstrated an abnormally enlarged left optic nerve in 2001, at which time her first MRI was performed. He optic neuritis has currently resolved, but she is presenting with worsening upper extremity numbness. Her current MRI shows progression in the number of abnormal foci in the periventricular white matter.
