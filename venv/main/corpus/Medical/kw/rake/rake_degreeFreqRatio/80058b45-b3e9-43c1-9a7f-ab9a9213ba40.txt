She was noted to have coarse facial features with prognathism, skin thickening and very large hands.

Visual field examination disclosed a right nasal quadrantanopsia. The neurological examination was otherwise normal.

Endocrine studies revealed an elevated baseline growth hormone level and normal prolactin.
CT disclosed a large intrasellar tumor with suprasellar extension more on the left than the right.  Surgery was performed.
Fig 1. Coronal CT showing the intrasellar tumor with suprasellar extension.  

Fig 2. Intraoperative smear prepared from the neoplasm showing sparsely granulated cytoplasm.  Also note the occasional intracytoplasmic eosinophilic fibrous bodies, best seen in the very center of the picture.

Fig 3. Histological section of the resected neoplasm showing the relatively uniform, sparsely granulated cells. 

Fig 4. Electron micrograph showing a typical intracytoplasmic body, characteristic of the sparsely granulated growth hormone secreting adenoma.
Sparsely granulated growth hormone adenoma
Sella and suprasellar mass:
<li>pituitary adenoma
<li>pituitary carcinoma or metastasis
<li>craniopharyngioma
This 50 year old woman had a several year history of enlarging hands and decreased visual acuity in her right eye.
