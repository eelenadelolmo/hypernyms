Left shoulder tenderness to touch with palpable mass noted about shoulder.
Chemotherapy followed by surgical resection of the primary tumor by orthopedic oncologist
Frontal and axillary radiographic views (fig. 1) of the left shoulder demonstrates an aggressive-appearing sclerotic lesion of the left proximal humeral metaphysis with "starburst" pattern of periosteal new bone formation, wide zone of transition, and pathologic fracture of the medial cortex.

Axial T2w image (fig. 2) reveals a soft tissue mass around the proximal left humerus, soft-tissue edema, and a left lung lesion.

Axial unenhanced chest CT (fig. 3) demonstrates calcified left hilar adenopthy and a left lung lesion.
Osteosarcoma
Infection (TB, disseminated fungal)
Neoplasm (osteosarcoma with metastasis)
Left shoulder pain.
