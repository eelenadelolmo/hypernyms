Patient is currently undergoing workup for mass and pending neurological consultation.
A bilobed extraaxial mass with a broad dural base and dural tail surrounding the interclinoid ligament with transosseous extension into the cavernous sinus with a tubular component extending into the foramen ovale and a broad component extending into the right quadrigeminal plate cistern.
Meningioma
Solitary meningioma
Meningioma and Trigeminal Schwannoma (Neurofibromatosis 2)
46 year old who initially had right perioral paresthesias and subjective hearing loss presented with worsening paresthesias and pain involving the mandibular distribution of the trigeminal nerve.
In unenhanced exams meningiomas are slightly hyperdense compared to schwannomas which are isodense or hypodense.  Calcification on CT favors meningioma.  Cystic degeneration favors schwannoma whereas fatty degeneration favors meningioma.  In this study there were osseous changes consistent with meningioma.  A diagnosis to be considered is a meningioma and a trigeminal schwannoma which can be seen in neurofibromatosis type 2.
