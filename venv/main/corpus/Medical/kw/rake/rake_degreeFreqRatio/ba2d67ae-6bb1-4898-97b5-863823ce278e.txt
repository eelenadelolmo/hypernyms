Radiographs:
Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs left tibia and fibula show Gustillo-anderson classification Grade IIIB Tibia fracture with external fixation, and wound vacuum dressing covering covering soft tissue.  Grade III B tibial fractures are characterized by a wound greater than 10 cm with a displaced fracture and diaphyseal segmental loss.  The diagnosis is supported by the radiographic findings of an open, comminuted fracture of the tibia with limb shortening.  

Bone scans:
99m Technetium-Duration 900 sec: Anterior and Posterior views of the lower extremities 
111 Indium-Duration 900 sec:  Anterior and Posterior views of the lower extremities show a moderately intense accumulation of leukocytes at the metaphyseal region of the right tibia proximal to the amputation margin.  Not associated with abnormal bone uptake, likely representing soft tissue inflammation.  A mild to moderate increased leukocyte uptake about the medial aspect of the distal left lower leg and hindfoot, spanning multiple bones, seemingly superficially.  A distribution suggestive of soft tissue inflammation.  A mild increased leukocyte concentration at the proximal metaphyseal region of the left femur in the region of multiple penetrating fixation pins with a vertical orientation, mostly superficial to bone.  Likely representing fracture callus and unlikely to represent infection tracking along fixation pins or the marrow cavity.  Focally increased blood flow, blood pool and bone phase uptake of radiotracer at the mid left tibial fracture is not associated with abnormal leukocyte concentration.  Other foci of mildly increased bone radiotracer concentrations and mild diffuse leukocyte concentrations are compatible with blast trauma and operative interventions.  No suggestion of specific post-operative complications.
Cellulitis without concomittant osteomyelitis
1.  Osteomyelitis
2.  Cellulitis 
3.  Fracture with callus formation
This patient is a 33-year-old African American with multiple injuries from an improvised explosive device in Iraq.  The patient sustained a traumatic below knee amputation (BKA) of the right lower extremity and a comminuted, open mid-diaphyseal left tibial and fibular fractures with a significant soft tissue defect. Taylor Spatial Frame was used to provide reduction and external fixation to his left tibia-fibula fractures, with a rectus flap and split thickness skin graft for the soft tissue injury.  The patient was readmitted a month later with purulent drainage from the rectus flap that grew out methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.  The taylor spatial frame was removed and patient underwent multiple irrigation and debridement procedures.  A tagged white blood cell scan was needed to determine if he had osteomyelitis associated with his cellulitis.   If the soft tissue infection extended to bone, it would delay scheduling of the replacement of his Taylor Spatial Frame.
When patients have sustained fractures or contusions or orthopedic surgery, the determination of osteomyelitis can be difficult because both edema associated with fractures and osteomyelitis will appear as high signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images and will enhance after contrast on T1-weighted MR images. In addition, MRI is contraindicated in this patient population when prosthetics and retained metal fragments are present.  The sensitivity of nuclear medicine techniques has been shown to be superior in these cases (1,3,4), particularly when tomographic techniques are used.  A recent meta-analysis suggeste that fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) may be more sensitive than other studies for diagnosing osteomyelitis, but only 4 patients were evaluated with PET as compared with the other modalities in  and therefore their conclusions are of uncertain significance.  Combined bone (13 patients and leukocyte scintigraphy (7 patients had a pooled sensitivity of 84% compared to 60% for MRI (4).Again, because of the the small number of patients evaluated, the sensitivity is of uncertain significance.
	This patient sustained a Grade IIIB fracture to his left tibia with subsequent reduction and external fixation with a Taylor Spatial Frame.  The patient presented with purulent drainage from his rectus flap site with subsequent removal of the Taylor Spatial Frame with placement of antibiotic beads for treatment of a MSSA soft tissue infection with possible osteomyelitis.  111-Indium labeled leukocyte scintigraphy was performed to rule out osteomyelitis.  However, this proved difficult in the context of fracture healing with increased blood flow and WBC uptake from the callus formation.  There is a recent study on the animal model to suggest that normal bone healing can be differentiated from osteomyelitis more effectively using fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (2).  In this study, investigators devised a standardized metaphyseal defect in rabbit tibias.  The experimental group was then injected with Staphylococcus aureus at the fracture site.  The researchers found that both the control group (normal fracture healing) and the experimental group (fracture healing with osteomyelitis) had increased uptake of 18F-FDG.  However, the experimental group had more intense and more continuous uptake, and the researchers suggested that 18F-FDG-PET may be an effective way to determine the difference between osteomyelitis and normal bone healing in an animal model.
