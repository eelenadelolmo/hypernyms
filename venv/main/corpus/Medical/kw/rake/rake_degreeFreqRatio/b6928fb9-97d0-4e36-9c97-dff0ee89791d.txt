Small nodular mass is palpated in mid upper abdomen, on physical exam
Surgical Pyloromyotomy to relieve the obstruction
• Plain Radiograph: distended stomach bubble with little distal gas.

• Ultrasound: thickened and elongated pylorus which persisted for and did not relax following feeds.

• Fluoroscopy: contrast material did not move past the pylorus of the stomach, despite multiple positional maneuvers over the course of 15 minutes.
Hypertrophic Pyloric stenosis
• Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis
• Antral gastric ulcer with scarring
• Ectopic pancreas
21 day old baby boy, with non-bilious projectile vomiting.
Radiography is seldom useful; however, massive distention of the stomach, little small bowel or colonic air, and visible gastric peristaltic waves are highly suggestive.

At UGI, all babies with HPS should show delayed gastric emptying and hyper-peristaltic waves - that stop at the pylorus.  If contrast passes through the pylorus, you would see the hypertrophied pylorus, producing indentation on the gastric antrum and the duodenal bulb along, with a "string sign" of a thin contrast stream within the narrow pyloric channel. 

Treatment for HPS is the Ramstedt pyloromyotomy.  This is a relatively safe procedure, with little if any morbidity or mortality; and, it is almost always effective.
