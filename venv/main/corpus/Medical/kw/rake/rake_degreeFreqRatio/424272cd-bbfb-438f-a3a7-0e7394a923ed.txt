Anticoagulation is the usual treatment.  Microcatheter treatment with local thrombolytics can also be used.  Emergency craniectomy for decompression if herniation develops.
Noncontrast CT demonstrates hyperdensity in the straight sinus and transverse sinus on the left.  The left mastoid air cells were fluid filled.

CTA demonstrates absence of contrast in the straight sinus, left transverse and sigmoid sinuses.  MRV confirms findings.
Dural sinus thrombosis
none
10 year old boy with recent upper respiratory infection presents with new onset headache and vomiting.
The patient was started on heparin with subsequent intracranial hemorrhage.  The heparin was discontinued and the patient extended thrombus into the sagittal sinus, vein of Galen and deep cerebral veins.  He then developed venous infarcts and numerous intracerebral hemorrhages and expired after undergoing emergency craniectomy.
