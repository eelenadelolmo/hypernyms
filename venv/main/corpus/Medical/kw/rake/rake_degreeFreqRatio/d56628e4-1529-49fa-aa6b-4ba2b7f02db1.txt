The patient was intubated and subsequently underwent tracheostomy.  She is currently still in the intensive care unit, day 20.
Diffuse, bilateral, hazy airspace opacities predominately in the mid to low lung zones.  Overall, these findings are nonspecific, but with known history of pulmonary hemorrhage after bronchoscopy or clinical findings of hemoptysis and anemia, these findings are consistent with diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage.
Pulmonary hemorrhage and Pulmonary-renal syndrome
-Pulmonary hemorrhage with renal disease:  Wegenerâ€™s granulomatosis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Goodpastureâ€™s syndrome, other vasculitides

-Pulmonary hemorrhage without renal disease:  Anitcoagulation, Pulmonary infection or neoplasm, Pulmonary embolism, Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, Trauma, Bone marrow transplantation
