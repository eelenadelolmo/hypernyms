Texto: 
Normal gravid physical exam and laboratory findings.
No action is required for this benign condition.
A thin line of increased echogenicity is present between the anterior and posterior walls of the gravid uterus. No gross anatomic abnormalities are seen in the fetus.
Uterine Synechiae
Differential diagnosis includes uterine synechiae, uterine shelf, and amniotic band syndrome.
24 year old woman presenting for routine obstetric follow up.
Uterine synechiae are differentiated from amniotic band syndrome in that the latter can cause amputation of fetal body parts and other abnormalities caused by entrapment withing the bands and adherence of fetal body parts to the exposed chorion.
