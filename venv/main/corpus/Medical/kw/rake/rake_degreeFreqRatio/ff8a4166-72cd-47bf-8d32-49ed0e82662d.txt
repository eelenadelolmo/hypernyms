Unremarkable physical exam.  Normal thyroid function panel.
This patient had hyperthyroidism that was previously treated.  Currently, her thyroid function panel within normal limits.

No specific treatment for the osseous findings is indicated.
Multiple areas of fluffy diaphyseal periosteal reaction - involving the metacarpals and distal radius bilaterally.  there is clubbing of the distal phalanges.
Thyroid Acropachy
• DDX for periosteal reaction involving multiple bones:
» Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy
» Venous stasis, vascular insufficiency
» Hypervitaminosis A
» Fluorosis
» Leukemia
» Infection
44 y/o woman, with history of treated endocrine abnormality.
The imaging findings for thyroid acropachy are secondary to increased bone turnover and bone loss related to hyperthryoidism.  60-80% of cases are seen secondary to Grave’s disease.  Osseous findings are generally seen following treatment for hyperthyroidism (radioactive iodine or thryoidectomy,) as in this case.  Associated lab abnormalities include elevated serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, and hypercalciuria.  There is no correlation between the thyroid acropachy and current thyroid state.

Clinical signs associated with hyperthyroidism include exophthalmos, soft tissue swelling, pretibial myxedema, clubbing, and periostitis.

Characteristic imaging findings include a fluffy diaphyseal reaction which is most pronounced in the metacarpals, commonly involving the radial aspects.  Soft tissue swelling and clubbing can also be identified on plain film.
