Herpes simplex encephalitis.
35 y/o male acute mental status change
Herpes encephalitis in the adult and older child is caused by Herpes Simplex I.  The disease is usually caused by the activation of the latent virus in the trigeminal ganglion.  HSV produces a necrotizing encephalitis.  Patients present with altered mental status, seizures, fever and/or headache.  Early diagnosis and treatment may decrease the mortality and morbidity rates. In the early stages of the disease, CT and MRI studies may be normal.   Diagnosis is typically made by HSV cultures, viral inclusion bodies or HSV polymerase chain reaction tests.  A definitive diagnosis is made when viral antigens are seen on brain biopsy.  Herpes has a predilection for the limbic system.  CT studies may demonstrate low density lesions in the temporal lobes with mild mass effect.  In later stages hemorrhages may occur.  MRI is typically the study of choice.  Acute findings include low T1 and increased T2 along the temporal and inframedial frontal lobes with local mass effect and sulcal effacement.  The more subacute findings will demonstrate increased edema with bilateral asymmetric gyral enhancement and may demonstrate areas of hemorrhage.  Differential diagnosis includes infarts, low grade glioma, and abcess.
