Review of the patient's record revealed history of Granular Cell tumors removed from the right thigh and abdominal wall in 1995.
Recommend correlation with history and biopsy as needed
Not Shown: No new lung mass (atelectasis)
Right sided, slightly hyperdense 2cm mid renal mass with iso-hypo metabolic activity relative to the rest of the kidney.

Shown: PET/CT images of four Cutaneous and Subcutaneous masses with increased metabolic activity with SUV approximately 2.5. Which had enlarged slightly since the CT examination almost 2 years prior.
Granular Cell Tumor
Metastatic disease
Granular Cell Tumors
Neurofibromas
Furuncles
51y/o man with a history of lung cancer (type not specified) 10 years ago, now with questionable new right lung and right renal masses was referred for PET-CT imaging. He had subcutaneous nodules presumed to be metastatic disease seen on CT.
