Patients with Osteogenesis Imperfecta can recieve treatment with bisphosphonates to decrease bone resorption and increase formation of bone.  Cyclical treatment with pamidronate also can improve bone formation and relieve chronic pain.  Regular screening for hearing loss (usually conductive) can also be helpful.  Patients are usually good candidates for auditory amplification.  Surgical realignment of bones can be therapeutic if patients are symptomatic.
This saggital T1 weighted MRI shows extensive basilar invagination and loss of the basilar angle (platybasia).  Prominence of sulci and ventricles are noted, as well as compression of the cervical vertebrae.
Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type III
Osteogenesis Imperfecta
This patient presents for management of his congenital disease.  He has had multiple fractures and severe malformation of bones.  Hearing loss has been documented over the past few years.
This patient had a classic symptom of hearing loss.  Up to 60 percent of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) patients experience hearing loss and up to 52 percent of these patients experience vertigo.  Though not all patients have platybasia, mechanical disruption of inner ear is believed to play a role in some patients (1).  Destruction or malformation of the ossicles (specifically fixation of the stapes) is the more common cause of hearing loss.  

This patient will be followed for progression of bony abnormalities and/or nerological deficits.  A cohort of 130 patients with OI and basilar impression (platybasia) were followed by serial MRI for five years without change in neurologic symptoms though many of these patients had progression of their platybasia.  The authors concluded that further study was nececesary to determine if this skull abnormality or its progression could in and of itself be a cause for neurological deficit.(2)

MRI has been chosen as the modality of choice for evaluation of the progression of skull abnormalities in this patient.  Platybasia may be followed with plain films, CT, or MRI, however, MRI provides a better view of the abnormalities of the intracranial contents and gives a better view of the osteopenic bone.(3)
