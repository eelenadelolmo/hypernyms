Brain herniation with brain death
None
4 year old girl who reportedly fell in shower.  No reported loss of consciousness.  Four hours later mother found child comatose and not breathing.
Because of the patient's age, this case will be considered as possible non-accidental trauma - even though there are no other findings on skeletal survey and no skull fracture.
