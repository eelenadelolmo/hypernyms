Texto: 
On the plain films, there is an obvious large radiopaque foreign body in the soft tissues adjacent to the left posterior temple region, compatible with a bullet. There was no definite displaced fracture. No radiopaque density is seen intracranially.  

On the selected CT images an approximately 3.0 cm x 1.9 cm left temporal parietal hematoma seen peripherally with surrounding local mass effect and edema.  No midline shift is seen.  The bullet fragments have been removed from the scalp.
Hemorrhagic Contusion.
Knowing the patient is status post gun shot wound the findings are compatible with a brain contusion.
26 year old male status post altercation, now with bleeding and headache.
Contusions are brain parenchymal bruises. The three most commonly observed patterns of brain parenchymal injury are shear injury, contusion and edema.

A cerebral contusion is a hemorrhagic focus within the brain parenchyma secondary to direct trauma. 
Unless they are grossly hemorrhagic the small size of most contusions can be a challenging diagnosis on CT. The superior ability of gradient-echo sequences to detect small amounts of hemoglobin makes MRI, the most useful study to identify cerebral contusions. 

In our case, CT imaging demonstrated a hypodense region surrounding a rather circumscribed mixed region of predominantly high density; compatible with edema surrounding a site of acute hemorrhage. 

A follow up MRI was ordered and if the patient had not left the hospital A.M.A, gradient echo images would have reconfirmed the focal hemorrhagic contusion and any change in the evolution of hemorrhage.
