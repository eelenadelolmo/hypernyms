Patient is non toxic appearing, afebrile, but shows increased work of breathing, is tachypnic, with course breath sounds bilaterally. Heart has regular rhythm without murmur, rub, or gallop. No cyanosis noted. Normal capillary refill. Mucus membranes moist and free of discharge or erythema.
Inotropes and diuretics for symptoms of CHF, but surgical correction by balloon septostomy or complete resection of accessory membrane is definitive.
Increased perihilar pulmonary markings suggestive of pulmonary venous congestion.  Cardiomegaly with enlarged right atrium and ventricle. Suggestive of underlying congenital heart disease.
Cor triatriatum
Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection
Bronchial asthma
Pulmonary vein stenosis
Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease
Supravalvular mitral ring
Pulmonary Hypertension, Persistent-Newborn
Atrial tumors
Patient had uncomplicated birth history. Brought to ED due to increased work of breathing, dyspnea, tachypnea, fussiness, and noisey breathing. Mother reports subjective fever. Child to be evaluated for respiratory infection.
Prognosis is excellent following corrective surgery.
