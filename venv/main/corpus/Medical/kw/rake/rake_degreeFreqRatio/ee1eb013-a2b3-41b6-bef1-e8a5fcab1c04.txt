CT: There is a right pleural effusion which spans base to apex.  There is consolidated appearance to the right lower lobe with associated air bronchograms.  There is bronchial wall thickening in the aerated portion of the right upper lobe.  The left lung also demonstrates a pleural effusion with marked airway wall thickening and associated consolidation at the bases.  There is suggestion of thickening of the interstitium.
