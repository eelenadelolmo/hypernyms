Enucleation and radiation therapy
Axial T1W images demonstrate ill-defined increased signal in posterior tissues of left globe and left retro-ocular tissues
Axial contrast-enhanced fat saturated T1W images demonstrate
enhancement and thickening of the posterior wall of the left globe and left retro-ocular tissues
Axial T2W images demonstrate a low intensity mass involving the posterior aspect of the left globe and retro-ocular tissues.
Uveal (Choroidal)Melanoma of the left globe with extension of tumor into the retro-ocular tissues
Uveal melanoma
Choroidal hemangioma
Ocular metastatic lesion
Hemorrhage
Decreased vision left eye
Melanoma involving the eye has atypical MRI signal characteristics for a tumor in that the lesion is bright on T1W weighted images and dark on T2W images, which opposite from most tumors. The paramagnetic properties of the melanin content of the tumor are responsible for this signal characteristic.
