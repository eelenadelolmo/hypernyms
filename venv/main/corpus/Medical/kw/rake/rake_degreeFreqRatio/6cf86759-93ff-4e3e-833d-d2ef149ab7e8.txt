Patient had abdominal distension and a mass was palpated in the RLQ. Abdomen was diffusely tender to palpation. No rebound or guarding was noted. Bowel sounds were diminished.
After the discovery of many metastases within the abdomen on CT, the patient underwent surgery for biopsy and resection of the tumor. Tissue was removed from the abdominal mass as well as a vaginal nodule, a uterine nodule, a rectosigmoid nodule, a vena cava lymph node and the appendix. The abdominal mass tissue was partially encapsulated, lobulated and yellow-tan in appearance with a size of 20cm X 11cm x 11cm. The mass weighed 1355g. The tumor was compatible with rhabdomyosarcoma on frozen section. The patient had metastatic disease (group IV) and was subsequently treated with systemic chemotherapy and radiation. At 6 month follow up, the patient had no evidence of new metastasis and was tolerating chemotherapy.
X-ray demonstrates abdominal distension.

CT demonstrates multiple ovarian metastases throughout the abdomen, including the liver, and large bowel.

Rhabdomyosarcoma is a frequent cause of death due to malignant disease in children and is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in pediatrics. Roughly 10% of all solid tumors in childhood are Rhabdomyosarcomas. These tumors are extremely malignant and tend to invade locally and metastases by hematogenous and lymphatic routes. Without treatment, 90% of patients die within one year of diagnosis. Rhabdomyosarcomas are equal between genders and are bimodal in age distribution with peaks at 4-6 years and 16-18 years of age. These tumors are thought to arise from totipotent mesenchymal cells and the histologic diagnosis can be difficult. Histologic types that can be seen in a rhadomyosarcoma include alveolar, embryonal, embryonal-botryoid, pleomorphic, and undifferentiated. Among these types, the alveolar variety has the worst prognosis. The botyroides type has the classic grape-like appearance. Rhabdomyosarcomas most commonly originate from the pelvis and GU tract with nearly 40% in these areas.
