Texto: 
Treatment for this patient was transurethral resection of posterior urethral valves.

• Followup ultrasonography at 8 weeks: Kidneys are not as large as previous study.  Echogenicity of renal parenchyma remains increased but cystic dysplasia is less obvious.  The collecting systems and ureters remain moderately distended.  The bladder is thickwalled, but empty.

• Follow up VCUG at 8 weeks: No residual bladder outlet obstruction appreciated.  Bladder wall remains thick.  No vesicoureteral reflux noted.
• Renal/Bladder Ultrasonography showed hydronephrosis with multiple parenchymal cysts, dilated ureters, and thickwalled bladder.
• Voiding cystourethrogram showed trabeculated bladder and dilated posterior urethra.  Incomplete voiding with residual contrast in bladder and urethra was noted.  No evidence of vesicoureteral reflux noted.
