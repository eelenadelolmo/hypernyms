Physical Exam and Laboratory: 
 Pain over the right lateral malleolus
Treatment and Follow-up: 
  Recommend MRI and Orthopedic consult for fragment reattachment or surgical removal.
Image Findings: 
A rounded focus of lucency with sclerotic margin is evident in the lateral dome of talus, measuring 1.1 cm in transverse dimension, present in association with a 1.2 cm x 5 mm ossific body located anterior to the tibiotalar joint.  Visualized joint spaces preserved.  Visualized soft tissue structures otherwise unremarkable.
Diagnosis: 
 Osteochondritis dissecans
Differential Diagnosis for these findings in this case:
 Osteochondritis dissecans, Foreign Body, Heterotopic Ossification
History (can include gestational age, or age in days, weeks, months):
 19-year-old active duty male with an inversion injury to the right ankle 6 weeks ago with pain over the right lateral malleolus.
Discussion (include references): 

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a condition in which a portion of the articular cartilage, with or without underlying subchondral bone, becomes partially or completely detached.  The most common mechanism of injury is trauma to the affected bone.   Common sites of OCD are the lateral aspect of medial femoral condyle, talar dome, capitellium of the elbow (humeral articular surface with radial head).  An inversion injury of the ankle with the foot in dorisflexion can produce this type of lesion (anterolateral talar dome fracture of the subchondral bone).  If the trauma were to occur while the foot was in plantarflexion a posterior medial talar fracture is possible.  

The loose body could be composed entirely of cartilage.  In this case, it is necessary to perform MRI of the region looking for the loose or partially separated fragments.  These lesions will be surrounded by a thin rim of fluid that would be bright on T2 weighted images.  Due to the narrow space adjacent to the talar dome, visulization of overlying cartilage can be difficult.  Use of pulse sequences that provide high contrast between articular fluid and cartilage such as fast spin echo proton density imaging or spoiled gradient-recalled echo imaging are essential for evaluation of talar dome cartilage.
