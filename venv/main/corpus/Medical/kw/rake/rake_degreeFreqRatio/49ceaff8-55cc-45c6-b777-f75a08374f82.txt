Texto: 
Distended abdomen with peritoneal signs.  WBC 17.3  Lactate 5.6 (0.5-2.2 nl)
60 cm of small bowel resected.
Diffuse ascites.  Dilated fluid filled small bowel, radially oriented with convergence of mesenteric vessels on a single point.  Bowel wall upper limit of normal thickness.  Distal segments of bowel decompressed, proximal segments less dilated with small bowel stool (not shown).
Closed Loop Obstruction
Small bowel obstruction, closed loop (favored) versus non-closed loop.
3 day history of worsening abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.  PSH of vaginal hysterectomy approximately 10 years earlier.
Per surgeon, the axis of bowel rotation was around a single adhesive band, probably from the patientâ€™s hysterectomy.  The bowel wall was necrotic, likely explaining the thin wall.
