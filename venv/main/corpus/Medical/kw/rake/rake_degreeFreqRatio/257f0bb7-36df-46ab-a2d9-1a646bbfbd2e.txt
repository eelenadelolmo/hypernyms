Texto: 
Elevated insulin and c-peptide levels. Low glucose levels.
Excision and monitoring for metastases.
Axial CT with IV contrast demonstrates a hypodense mass with circumscribed enhancement in the body of the pancreas.
Insulinoma. Although the Octreotide scan was performed and was negative, histologic analysis of the surgical specimen revealed an insulinoma.
Islet cell tumors like insulinoma
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma, unlikely
Macrocystic adenoma, unlikely
