Normal Exam & Labs
Semi-annual monitoring CT scan to evaluate for progression of disease.  If plaques remain stable, will conduct annual follow-up evaluations.
â€¢ Lung parenchyma - no masses or airspace disease.

â€¢ Bilaterally, numerous calcified pleural plaques along thoracic cage and diaphragmatic surfaces.

â€¢ Small rectangular scattered non-calcified pleural thickenings are also observed.  

â€¢ There is no mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.
Pleural Plaques consistent with asbestos exposure
â€¢ Asbestos exposure
â€¢ Pleural TB
â€¢ Pleural metastasis
56 y.o. man presents for follow up after initial evaluation of rib pain from a bicycle tumble.

Denies any pulmonary symptoms
Pleural plaques are circumscribed areas of pleural thickening, often diffuse or multifocal. These may frequently be calcified, and are characteristically found along the lower thorax and diaphragmatic pleura. The lesions are only rarely found in the costophrenic sulci and lung apices most often avoiding these areas. Calcified diaphragmatic pleural plaques are essentially pathognomonic for asbestos exposure, and may develop as much as 20 years after initial exposure. 

Asbestosis is a pneumoconiosis resulting from the inhalation of asbestos fibers and leads to a slowly progressive diffuse pulmonary fibrosis. The primary complications are respiratory failure and malignancy (asbestos expsore may increase the risk of malignant mesothelioma by 300 fold compared to non-exposed individuals).
