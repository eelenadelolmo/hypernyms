Texto: 
The patient has point tenderness on the talus and has 12 degrees of pronation bilaterally. He has a history of multiple fractures of the left foot to include a Jones fracture and a navicular fracture. He has disregarded medical advice for post-trauma care in the past. For example, he began water skiing only three weeks after two fractures of the foot with refusal of a cast.
His pain was relieved with form fitted orthodics at Landstuhl Army Medical Center, Germany, to neutralize the pronation. At 10 year follow-up: He is still sking alpine, nordic, diagonal stride, and races cross county skate skiing with little pain. Surgery was not attempted to repair the OCD.
AP and lateral radiographs of left ankle are negative. T1-weighted MR image shows focal area of low signal intensity in the medial aspect of the left talus. FSE T2-weighted MR image with fat saturation shows focal area of high signal intensity in the anteromedial aspect of the left talus.
