Vital signs: within normal limits

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Abdomen: soft, normoactive bowel sounds, no distention or organomegaly appreciated. Mild tenderness to palpation diffusely but more pronounced in the suprapubic area. No rebound or guarding observed
Other systems within normal limits. 

LABORATORY RESULTS:
CBC, CMP, ESR and CRP within normal limits
Negative stool guaiac and normal fecal calprotectin

Urinalysis at the time of admission: within normal limits
color: yellow
appearance: hazy
pH: 7.0
glucose: negative
ketones: negative
bilirubin: negative
nitrites: negative
leukocyte esterase: moderate
blood: negative
urobilinogen: 0.2 (Reference range: 0.2-1.0)
protein: negative
specific gravity: 1.015
source: clean catch

Urine culture: no growth after 2 days
Urologist consulted believed that patient&#39;s symptoms were likely unrelated to the calcifications noted on imaging especially since urinalysis was benign. There was no evidence of obstruction and the pain experienced by the patient was not lateralized. 
No follow up for this condition was recommended since patient&#39;s symptoms resolved with bowel clean out.
IMAGING DONE PRIOR TO ADMISSION:
Abdominal X-ray 1: several unchanged calcifications present in lower pelvis, below the level of the ischial spines, may be representative of phleboliths. Ultrasound recommended to exclude ovarian or bladder calcifications. See Figure 1. 

Abdominal ultrasound: multiple calcific densities. Significant shadowing associated with the areas of previous Deflux procedure but ureteral stones trapped at the orifice cannot be excluded. See Figure 2. 

Abdominal CT stone protocol: uterus and ovaries appear normal, multiple pelvic calcifications. Largest calcification appears to be at ureteral inlet on left side in the bladder, widest dimension approximately 8mm. Similar smaller lesions present on the right side, 5mm in maximum dimension. Single calcification in high right pelvis could be in ureter or could be a fecalith. Concern for bilateral stone disease. Intravenous Pyelogram (IVP) recommended for evaluation for possible obstruction. See Figures 3 and 4. 

IVP: kidneys and ureters normal in position and size, no delay in excretion of contrast. Calcifications present in distal ureters bilaterally without evidence of obstruction. See Figure 5.

IMAGING DONE WHILE ADMITTED:
Abdominal X-ray after bowel clean out: pelvic calcifications consistent with ureteral stones again identified. See Figure 6.

Sequela of Deflux procedure
This 8 y.o. girl has a history of irritable bowel syndrome and bilateral vesicoureteral reflux, addressed with a Deflux procedure during early infancy. She presents with diffuse acute worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and intermittent non-bilious, non-bloody emesis for 3 weeks. 

For the past year, patient has been taking daily fiber and miralax prn. The patient was recently started on Levsin 0.125mg tablet every 4 hours, as needed for pain but reported no improvement in symptoms. Abdominal imaging was done some days before admission.
Approximately 1% of children worldwide have vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) which is graded via voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) from Grade I to V depending on how retrograde the urine is able to travel and the degree of ureteral dilation. 

Endoscopic Deflux injection has been associated with complications including hematuria, both gross and microscopic, urinary tract infections, rise in serum creatinine and flank pain. Rarely complications including contralateral VUR and ureteral obstruction by the material resulting in de novo hydronephrosis have been observed and documented. 
There are now also reports, including this one, of calcification at the site of Deflux injection, mimicking stone disease on imaging but without associated symptoms or signs of urinary obstruction.
