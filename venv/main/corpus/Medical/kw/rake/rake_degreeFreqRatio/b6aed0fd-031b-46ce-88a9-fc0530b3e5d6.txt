JOINT LAXITY ASSOCIATED WITH OVERHEAD AND CROSS-ARM MOVEMENT DIFFICULTY.  OCCASIONAL LOCKING SYMPTOMS.
Patients who have anterior dislocation for the first time undergo reduction and treatment for pain and physical therapy. If adequate trials of physical therapy fail, indicated by continued anterior instability and pain, or if multiple dislocations occur, more invasive procedures are performed.  Various surgical procedures have been developed for treatment of recurrent anterior dislocations of the humeral head.  Treatment can be either by arthroscopy or open anterior shoulder repair (axillary approach or the Bankart lesion fixation procedure); other procedures include the Bristow Helfet procedure, Magnuson Stack procedure, Eden Hybinette procedure, Oudard procedure and Trillat procedure.  The Bankart procedure is the gold standard, with success rates of 90-95%.  In associated Hill-Sachs lesions, the glenoid can be augmented with a tricortical iliac crest graft.Traditionally, arthroscopic techniques have had a failure rate of about 20% at 3.5 years, whereas the newer Bankart fixation techniques have brought this down to 10% or less.  Support is gathering for earlier surgical intervention in patients with recurrent dislocations.
A-P RADIOGRAPHS:  SUBCHONDRAL SCLEROSIS  IN THE REGION OF THE GLENOID TUBERCLE WITH DEPRESSION OF POSTERO-LATERAL HUMERAL HEAD ON EXTERNAL ROTATION.  REMAINDER OF BONES NORMAL; NO BANKART LESION APPRECIATED.

TWO FSE PROTON DENSITY W/ FAT SAT. AXIAL MR IMAGES OF RIGHT SHOULDER SHOW:
1.	MORE SUPERIOR IMAGE, AT LEVEL OF SUPERIOR GLENOID, FLATTENING OF POSTERIOR-LATERAL ASPECT CONSISTENT WITH HILL-SACHS DEFORMITY.  HIGH SIGNAL INTENSITY AROUND HUMERAL HEAD REPRESENTS CARTILAGINOUS/OSSEOUS TISSUE WITH EDEMA/CONTUSION.
2.	HIGH SIGNAL INTENSITY IN REGION OF POSTEROLATERAL MARGIN OF HUMERAL HEAD IS MORE EVIDENT, AND IN THE CARTILAGINOUS AND SUBJACENT HUMERUS IS CONSISTENT WITH EDEMA/CONTUSION, CONSISTENT WITH HILL-SACHS DEFORMITY.

FSE PROTON DENSITY W/ FAT SAT. CORONAL OBLIQUE MR IMAGE OF RIGHT SHOULDER SHOWS HIGH SIGNAL INTENSITY SEPARATING ANTERIOR LABRUM FROM BONY LABRUM CONSISTENT WITH BANKART LESION.
HILL-SACHS DEFORMITY WITH ASSOCIATED BANKART LESION
FINDINGS DIAGNOSTIC OF HILL-SACHS DEFORMITY AND BANKART LESION, CORRELATIVE WITH THE PATIENT HISTORY OF RECURRENT ANTERIOR DISLOCATIONS.
H/O THREE ANTERIOR SHOULDER DISLOCATIONS SINCE AGE 21, ALL PLAYING RUGBY.
