Well developed, well nourished 32 y/o WF in NAD. BP 122/78, Pulse 90 regular, RR 16 unlabored, Afebrile, Wt 126#, Ht 5‚Äô7". Pulse oximetry RA 99%, on room air. HEENT: exam unremarkable. Neck supple, nodes negative, no JVD or HJR, carotids equal w/o bruits, thyroid unremarkable. Lungs clear; no wheezing, rales, or rhonchi. No pericardial or pleural rubs. Cardiac: rhythm regular, S1S2 WNL, w/o S3, S4, or murmur. No peristernal heaves. PMI WNL. Abdomen soft, BS normoactive, nontender, no organomegaly or masses. Pelvic not performed. Rectal negative, stool hemoccult negative. Peripheral pulses good. 1-2+ edema LLE to level of knee; Homan‚Äôs positive on left; left calf tender; also tender left medial thigh to mid thigh level. RLE negative. No signs of varicose veins or venous insufficiency. Brief neuro exam unremarkable.

CBC, Chemistries, UA, Coagulation studies all unremarkable.
Following admission the patient was seen by a hematologist, and evaluation for a hypercoaguability syndrome was negative. IV unfractionated heparin was started, along with coumadin.  Adequate INR was achieved on hospital day 6, and the heparin drip was stopped. Pain and edema of the LLE resolved. The patient was discharge the following day.  No complications or problems were encountered during hospitalization. The patient was discharged on coumadin and was given venous compression stockings.
CXR ‚Äì unremarkable, NAPD.
Compression U/S ‚Äì RLE:  Normal, easily compressible hypoechoic veins with some posterior wall enhancement in proximal RLE.  No evidence of venous distention.

Compression U/S - LLE:  Noncompressibility of common femoral vein with echogenic thrombus within the vein lumen consistent with chronic DVT.
Chronic recurrent DVT
Chronic DVT, Acute DVT, Baker‚Äôs cyst, cellulitis, lymphedema, chronic venous insufficiency, superficial thrombophlebitis, popliteal venous or arterial aneurysm, enlarged lymph nodes compressing the veins, heterotopic ossification, hematoma, and muscle tears.
32 y/o WF with a 4-day history of left leg pain beginning at mid-thigh level and edema below the level of the knee over the previous 24-hour period.  She was feeling well prior to the onset of these symptoms.

About 18 months earlier, the patient had been involved in a MVA, during which she sustained soft tissue trauma to the right lower leg, and multiple metatarsal fractures.  A short cast was applied, and the patient was discharged from the hospital on crutches without RLE weight bearing.  The patient returned one week later complaining about pain in the right calf and that the ‚Äúcast was too tight‚Äù.  The cast was removed and compression ultrasound confirmed DVT.  The patient was started on Lovenox 1mg/kg SC q12h until PO anticoagulation with Coumadin was established.  The patient remained on Coumadin for 4 months without any complications or recurrence.  Prior to this current problem, the patient was fully ambulatory, there was no recent history of trauma to the left leg, and no other risk factors for DVT could be identified.
