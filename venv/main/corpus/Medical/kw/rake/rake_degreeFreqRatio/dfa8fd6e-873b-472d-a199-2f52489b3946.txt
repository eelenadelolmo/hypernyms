	Progessive senile osteoporosis
Renal:	Medullary sponge kidney
	Renal tubular acidosis
	Barter syndrome
Drugs:	Furosemide in infants
	Prolonged ACTH therapy
	Excess vitamin E, D or calcium
	Nephrotoxic drugs such as amphotericin B
Miscellaneous
	Sarcoidosis
	Idiopathic hypercalciuria or hypercalcemia
