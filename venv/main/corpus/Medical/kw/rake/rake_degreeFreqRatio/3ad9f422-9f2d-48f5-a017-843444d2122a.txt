Texto: 
A series of iatrogenic complications resulted that ultimately required  interventional radiology.  Treatment of the pneumothorax was introduction of a small lumen chest catheter through the anterior chest wall just lateral to the sternum.
Treatment of the hemothorax was deployment of embolization coils to the lacerated left internal thoracic artery, performed by the interventional radiologists. A pigtail chest tube catheter was also introduced anteriorly to drain the pneumothorax.
Image 1 shows the pre-pacer portable cxr with evidence of chronic lung disease and scarring in both bases. Images 2,3, and 4 demonstrate the left medial pneumothorax which occurred during pacemaker placement. Image 5 demonstrates reduction of the pneumothorax by a small lumen anterioly placed chest catheter. Image 6 and 7 demonstrates acute left hemothorax which occurred immediately after removal of the chest catheter. Her left internal thoracic artery had been lacerated but tamponaded during chest tube insertion. Removal of the chest tube released the tamponade resulting in acute hemorrhage. Image 8 demonstrates successful embolization of the hemorrhage and introduction of a pigtail chest tube catheter to drain the hemothorax.
Pneumothorax
Pneumopericardium
Pneumomediastinum
Pneumoperitoneum
Large Bullae
Patient admitted originally for hemoptysis. She has a history of chronic lung disease and bronchiectasis. During the course of hospitalization, she required the introduction of a pacemaker.
Iatrogenic pneumothorax occurs in approximately 1.5% of pacemaker insertions. Iatrogenic hemothorax is an infrequent, but known complication of anterior chest tube insertion. ICU patients are frequently the recipients of multiple invasive procedures and the radiologist viewing portable ICU films must maintain continuous vigilance for complications, which often are subtle in presentation.
