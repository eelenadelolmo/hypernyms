Texto: 
Colonoscopy findings and prior pathologic diagnosis, as above.
Follow up with surgeon for staging, consideration of hemi-colectomy, if single lesion.
One vertebral body-length, circumferentially narrowed transverse colon segment, with irregular and strictured (but patent) lumen.
Annular "Apple Core" Colonic Lesion: a Differential Diagnosis.
Metachronous adenoCa lesion versus second primary
TB or other infiltrating colonic wall infection
Sarcoid infiltration
Known adenocarcinoma of sigmoid colon, status post partial resection. Now with strictured lesion on colonoscopy which cannot be passed with colonoscope.
Classic apple core lesion with typical etiology most likely source
