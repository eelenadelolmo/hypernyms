1-day-old male in respiratory distress and labored breathing.  Crackles heard bilaterally
Reposition endotracheal tube.  Placement of pleural chest tube.  Clinical evaluation of pneumothorax and atelectasis.  Monitor O2 Sats.
1.	Right main stem intubation and collapse of left lung.  Lucencies in lateral right lung field consistent with hyperinflation or pulmonary interstitial emphysema.
2.	Correct placement of  ET tube.  Right-sided tension pneumothorax.  Left lung field has opacities consistent with atelectasis.
3.      Right pleural drainage tube placed with reexpansion of right lung (note linear lucencies in right base); Umbilical venous and arterial lines placed.
Right main stem intubation, with consequent pulmonary interstitial emphysema complicated by tension pneumothorax
Neonatal RDS, Infection (pneumonia),  Tracheal esophageal fistula,  Congenital malformation (diaphragmatic hernia)  or hypoplastic lungs.
Premature infant delivered at 27 weeks gestation.  Pregnancy complicated by PPROM and placenta previa.  Child delivered due to increased maternal bleeding
