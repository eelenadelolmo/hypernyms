Texto: 
Contrast CT image shows multiple large encapsulated lesions in right and left lobe of liver. Peripheral and central (on left lobe)regions of high attenuation. While on contrast CT alone, these areas could represent enhancement, a noncontrast CT performed at an  outside institution (images not available) showed similar high attenuation, indicative of hemorrhage.
Metastatic melanoma
Giant hemangiomas
Hemorrhagic liver lesion
Worsening right upper quadrant pain in past few days.
The above patient was a 50 year old male with history of melanoma, and previously (2 years prior) normal CT of the abdomen and pelvis.  These factors (rapid appearance, male gender, cancer history) greatly implicate metastatic disease (confirmed by biopsy), and vitually exclude the diagnosis of Hepatic Adenoma, HCC, FNH and Hemangioma, as these lesions would have been identified previously.
