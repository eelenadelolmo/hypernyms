Distended tympanic abdomen.
No treatment required due to spontaneous resolution of the small bowel obstruction once the small bowel intussusception reduced.
Initial plain radiographs demonstrate dilated loops of small bowel (>3 cm) and multiple small bowel air-fluid levels in a stepladder pattern.  Hairpin loops of bowel and a "string of pearls" sign (created by the small bubbles of gas that are between the folds of dilated and fluid-filled small bowel loops) are present.  

Contrast-enhanced axial CT images of the abdomen were subsequently obtained.  Of note, spontaneous clinical improvement occurred shortly after the administration of oral contrast material.  CT images demonstrated a small bowel intussusception.
Small bowel obstruction secondary to transient intussusception.
Small bowel obstruction secondary to:
    Adhesions (postsurgical or postinflammatory)
    Incarcerated hernia
    Malignancy
    Intussusception
    Volvulus
    Gallstone ileus
Adynamic ileus
Sixty five-year-old male with abdominal discomfort and bilious discharge from PEG tube for three days.
This patient had a history of multiple abdominal surgeries.  Postsurgical adhesions are known to account for the vast majority of small bowel obstructions in the United States.  The patient's symptoms spontaneously improved shortly after the administration of oral contrast material and a small bowel intussusception was identified on a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.  This patient's small bowel intussusception proved to be transient and resolved without intervention.
