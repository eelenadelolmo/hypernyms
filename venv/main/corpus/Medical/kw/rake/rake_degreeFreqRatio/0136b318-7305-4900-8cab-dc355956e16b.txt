Pain at the lateral aspect of ankle.
None
Ankle:
Irregular sclerotic lesions in the central medullary portion of the distal tibia, talus, calcaneus, and cuboid bones with no evidence of bony expansion, soft tissue lesion, periosteal reaction, or fracture.

HIPS
Three views of the bilateral hips demonstrate irregular sclerotic lesions in the bilateral femoral heads. There is no evidence of bony collapse or flattening of the femoral heads. Subtle irregular sclerotic lines are evident in the bilateral pubis symphysis.
Joint spaces and bony alignment are well maintained.

T1 and T2 fat-saturated images of the ankle demonstrate multiple T1 hypointense and T2 hyper- and hypo-intense lesions within the talus and calcaneus.  These areas are inhomogenous and irregular.

Tib/Fib
Irregular sclerotic lesions in the central medullary portion of the distal femur and proximal tibia with no evidence of bony expansion, periosteal reaction, or fracture.
Avascular Necrosis
Differential diagnosis of Avascular Necrosis
Trauma
Idiopathic (legg-Calve-Perthes, Kohler, Freiberg, Chandler)
Infection
Steroid use 
Systemic
Alcoholism
Atherosclerosis
Collagen vascular disease/Vasculitis (SLE, polyarteritis nodosa, RA)
Sickle cell disease
Gaucher
Amyloidosis
Caisson disease
Diabetes
Man presents with ankle pain and needs MRI to evaluate for ligamentous injury. History of diabetes, lymphoma, and renal failure. Patient had renal transplant 5 years prior.
