Patient has open comminuted fracture of right humerus s/p external fixation.
The patient received an external fixation for a right open ulnar fracture in Landstuhl Regional Medical Center.  The patient received an external fixation for a right open ulnar fracture in Europe.  He was then transferred to a stateide Medical Center for further treatment.  An open reduction with internal fixation was performed to realign the humerus fragments.  
  
Throughout his various orthopedic surgeries he recieved a 42 day course of amikacin and ceftazidime and a 30 day course of fluconazole fore his mulitple wound infections.  Several radiographs were taken in the following months to insure that the bone was healing correctly.  The patient will also need a right upper extremity electromylogram to assess for possible radial nerve injury.
AP and lateral views show external fixation with screw attachments at the proximal and distal humerus.  There is extensive comminuted mid diaphyseal fracture with minimal medial displacement and much greater apex ventral angulation. 
There is soft tissue defect at the level of the fracture and at the elbow.  
Large shrapnel fragments imbedded in the soft tissue at the elbow and distal upper arm. Surgical drain is positioned at that level.  
The humeral head appears normal.
Comminuted mid diaphyseal open fracture of humerus with shrapnel embedded in soft tissue.
Comminuted mid diaphyseal open fracture of humerus with shrapnel embedded in soft tissue.
19 year old man injured by and Improvised Explosive Device (IED), resulting in multiple wounds on all four extremities.
The blast injury caused an extensive comminuted mid diaphyseal fracture of the right humerus with minimal medial displacement and much greater apex ventral angulation.  There were also large shrapnel fragments imbedded in the soft tissue at the elbow and distal upper arm.
    
Radiographs of the humeral shaft in an anteroposterior and lateral plane are necessary to evaluate the amount of angulation or displacement of the fracture.  If a physical exam cannot exclude injury to the shoulder and elbow, radiographs should include those joints as well.

Computed tomagraphy (CT) is often used to help assess difficult fractures such as these.  Tuberosity fracture segments, especially the lesser tuberosity, and their displacements are often very difficult to assess without additional imaging.  CT in the difficult three-part and four-part fractures can also help with the preoperative planning.  Often, in a highly comminuted fracture such as this, the displacement and positioning of fragments are best visualized through CT.  CT scans can also provide additional information regarding articular involvement with head splitting fractures, impression fractures, chronic fracture dislocations, glenoid rim fractures and surgical neck assessment.

In cases where there is shrapnel, a magnetic resonace image would be contraindicated because of the danger of the powerful magnets on the metal inbedded in the patient.

Three-part fractures or fracture dislocations and four-part fractures without dislocation should be treated with operative reconstruction as soon as the patient can tolerate the procedure.  However, this is only recommended if there is adequate bone quality that can withstand pin fixation.  This was true for this patient, who underwent an open reduction with internal fixation to realign the humerus fragments.
