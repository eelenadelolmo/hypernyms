Conservative with aspirin and antiplatelet therapy
Occlusion of the left Common carotid artery in the neck, proximal to the bifurcation.  Flow is preserved in the ipsilateral ICA from collateral flow via the contralateral external carotid branches and ipsilateral muscular branches of the left vertebral artery.  The ipsilateral ICA is quite small (string sign) due to low flow and diminshed pressure in the vessel.
