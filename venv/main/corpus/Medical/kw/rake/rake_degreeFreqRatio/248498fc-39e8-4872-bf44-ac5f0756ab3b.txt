Swollen and tender right ear
Patient was placed on IV antboitics and heprin then underwent surgery.
There is a complex fluid collection external to the right skull base convexity within the soft tissues.  It is lateral to the mastoid air cells with prominent enhancement of the wall of the fluid collection.  There is an adjacent opacification of the right mastoid air cells with bony erosion along the posterior wall.
mastoiditis
No other significant differential
2-year-old girl inadequately treated for ear infection, now seen with large swollen right ear.
Infants and children are more prone to mastoiditis due to their increased risk of otitis media.  The mastoids are typically seeded by the inner ear infection.  The first signs may be fluid accumulation within the mastoid and you may see loss of the normal septation with indistinctness of the bony walls.  As the infection progresses, you may see a reactive demineralization which may progress to coalescence of the mastoid.  Complications of mastoiditis include temporal bone osteomyelitis, sigmoid sinus thrombosis,epidural abscess, meningitis and fistulas.  Treatment begins with antibiotics but in severe cases surgery will be required.
