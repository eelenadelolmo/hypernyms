Texto: 
Focal hydronephroisis of the upper pole of the right kidney.  A thin-walled ureterocele projects into the bladder lumen; visualized portions of the distal right ureter were dilated.
Duplex Kidney with Ectopic Ureterocele
A simple cyst in the upper pole of the right kidney would present a similar appearance, but would not be associated with hydroureter or ureterocele.
Pt was referred for RUQ and this finding was incidental.
