Pain on movement of right hip, elevated CRP, WBC count normal.
As per orthopaedics; partial immobilization/decreased activity; monitoring for infection.
-2 phase nuclear bone scan with supero-lateral rt femur cortex increased uptake, not clearly in marrow/prosthesis cavity (pools normal).
-Bone Marrow nuclear scan without unusual activity in area of prosthesis, minimal increase just infero-lateral to area of prosthesis.
-In-11 WBC scan not positive for marrow in area of prosthesis, but minimally so in area corresponding to BM scan, infero-lateral to prosthesis.
Right hip pain secondary to prosthesis loosening, not infection.
Prosthesis loosening
Prosthesis-caused osteomyelitis
avascular necrosis
other inflammatory process
status post right total hip arthroplasty several years prior, now with increasing right hip pain of 3 months' duration.
The original 2 phase Tc-99m MDP bone scan exhibited the expected lack of activity in the rt hip marrow cavity, with no unusual pooled activity to suggest significant inflammation. However, there was a slight but clear increase seen within the lateral cortex of the right femur, in the area just inferior to the prosthesis tip.
  The next study, the bone marrow scan, did not localize activity in the area of the prosthesis' inferior tip: had it done so, [sub-acute or chronic]infection could have been ruled out, and inflammatory BM increase would have indicated loosening at this point. There was a very small focus of activity just infero-lateral to the expected location of the inferior tip of the prosthesis.
  The last study, the In-111 WBC scan, was performed to prove that the lack of bone marrow activity on the sulfur colloid BM scan was not due to infection (or show same, if it was). When no tagged WBCs were shown to exist in the area of the prosthesis tip, infection was essentially ruled out. The tiny focus of activity just infero-lateral to the prosthesis tip, corresponding to the same tiny uptake on the BM scan, was evidence of the [expected] WBCs seen in the same place as bone marrow, i.e., normal bone marrow constituent leukocytes. 
  The presence of normal cortical bone uptake of the Tc-99m MDP ruled out the possibility of avascular necrosis.
