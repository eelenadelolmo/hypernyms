Texto: 
Left lower quarant pain to palpation, negative urinalysis, normal WBC count
Prone to stone formation where the ureter crosses the anterior fused portion of the renal parenchyma.  No specific follow-up.
CT was performed without contrast to look for a ureteral stone, and because this rather portly gentleman had plenty of mesenteric contrast agent (i.e fat)
Horseshoe Kidney
Incidentally noted Horseshoe kidney
38 year old white male active duty sailor presents with left abdominal and flank pain
