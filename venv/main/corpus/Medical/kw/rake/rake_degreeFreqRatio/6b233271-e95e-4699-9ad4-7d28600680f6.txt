Patient had tenderness to palpation over the right lower quadrant at McBurney's point.  The patient has rebound tenderness.  The patient's temperature is 100.7 F, and her WBC count is 15.2.
Surgical removal of the appendix.  The patient had an uncomplicated post-surgical course, and was discharge from the hospital in two days.
Blind ending tubular structure in the right lower abdomen arising from the cecum and measuring up to 11 mm in maximum diameter.  There are inflammatory changes of the surrounding fat.  There is a 2-3 mm calcified density at the proximal aspect of the appendix which likely represents an appendicolith.  There is no evidence of abscess or perforation.
