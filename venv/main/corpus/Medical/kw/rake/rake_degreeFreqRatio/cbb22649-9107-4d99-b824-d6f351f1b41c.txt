After this exam the patient was referred to the high risk maternal fetal group at our instituation for further evaluation.  The patient delivered one week later on 31 DEC 2003.  The patient demonstrated a normal voiding pattern and had an unremarkable physical exam.  He was sent home 3 days later on prophylactic antibiotics and is pending a postnatal ultrasound and probable VCUG pending those results.
Images from 16 SEP 2003 demonstrate renal pelvis dilatation to approximately 7mm in AP dimension bilaterally.  Normal appearing renal parenchyma and bladder.  Normal amniotic fluid volume.  

Follow up sonogram on 17 OCT 2003 demonstrate interval decrease in the renal pelvis dimension to a less significant measurement of 4mm bilaterally.

Follow up exam on 23 DEC 2003 demonstrate marked worsening of renal pelvis size.  Current measurements up to 14mm bilaterally. Additionally there is calyceal dilatation bilaterally. The renal parenchyma remained normal however.  No cortical atrophy identified.
The bladder is also dilated and did not empty during the exam, which took over 1.5 hours to complete and fully evaluate with staff review.  The bladder wall was not particularly thickened on this exam.  The distal ureters are dilated bilaterally.  
There was a relative oligohydramnios seen during the exam.  Although gestastional age at the time was approximately 36 weeks.
Prenatal Hydronephrosis of unknown etiology as of yet.
1. Vesico-ureteric reflux
2. Posterior urethral valves
3. UVJ obstruction
4. Prune-belly syndrome 
5. UPJ obstruction
22 year old woman comes for routine OB ultrasound and the fetus is found to have mild hydronephrosis.  The woman had close interval followup exams.  On most recent follow up exam, fetus found to have markedly progressed renal pelvis dilatation.
