An air enema was performed under fluoroscopy. The intussusception was able to be reduced.  An abdominal x-ray was performed in left lateral decubitus after the procedure, confirming no free air. Patient was admitted to observation status and discharged the next day. She was tolerating a regular diet and denied pain.
•Supine AP x-ray of the abdomen
RUQ shows an absence of gas at the hepatic flexure. Differential is stool vs. intussusception.

•Abdominal Ultrasound
 RUQ contained a reniform mass, “the pseudokidney sign.”
Intussusception
The Pseudokidney sign is an ultrasound finding that is very sensitive and specific for intussusception. 

However, other conditions that cause bowel edema can also cause this sign, such as:
»Midgut Volvulus
»Sigmoid Volvulus
»Necrotizing Enterocolitis

False Positives reported with:
»Hematoma
»Stool
»Perforated Meckel's Diverticulum
CC: Abdominal pain

HPI: 3 ? year old Caucasian female presented with 3 days of colicky abdominal pain, worse in right upper quadrant. This was accompanied initially by 7 episodes of non-bilious vomiting, anorexia, and decreased energy. 2 days ago, her mother (a nurse) felt a mass in the RUQ, and took her to her PCP. A UA (negative) and KUB were ordered. After the x-ray was read by our radiology dept., we requested an ultrasound. By the time that the ultrasound was preformed, the pain had resolved. 
Denies Fevers, chills, bloody stools. Last BM 1 day ago was small and hard.

PMH: mild asthma, albuterol prn 
Full term, negative birth history
This presentation of intussusception, with a slight delay to diagnosis, is typical; appendicitis is by far more common and is the diagnosis of exclusion for abdominal pain in the patient's age group.
