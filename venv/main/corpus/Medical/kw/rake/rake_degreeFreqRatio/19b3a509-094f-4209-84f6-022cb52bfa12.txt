Image findings demonstrate bilateral, symmetric abnormal increased T2 signal within the white matter of the superior cerebellum.  There is mild enhancement of the affected white matter.  There is no mass effect, hemorrhage or other lesions within the brain parenchyma.  Diffusion weighted images are negative for acute infarct.  Gradient echo images demonstrate no evidence of old hemorrhage
