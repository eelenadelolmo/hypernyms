Texto: 
Following dose of 12.0 mCi F-18 FDG, standard whole body positron emission tomography was performed, including a "non-dedicated" image of the brain. Selected coronal and axial PET images of the brain demonstrate markedly decreased right cerebral metabolism most marked in the right parietal lobe, as well as decreased contralateral cerebellar activity.
Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (most likely based upon scintigraphic appearance and history)
Multifocal infarct
Developmental anomoly
Crossed cerebellar diaschisis
70 year old male with history of abdominal liposarcoma referred for evaluation for metastatic disease.  Additional history included stroke.
