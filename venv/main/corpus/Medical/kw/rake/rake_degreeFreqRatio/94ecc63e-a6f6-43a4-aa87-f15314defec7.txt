Emergent surgical repair with aortic  and iliac grafts.
Kidneys recovered function.
â€¢ Intimal flap seen originating at the root of the aorta and extending downward into both common iliac arteries. 

â€¢ The Celiac, Superior Mesenteric and Inferior Mesenteric Arteries were being perfused by a very small residual true lumen. 

â€¢ There is pleural fluid on the right; and, bilateral atelectasis and/or air space disease.

â€¢ Aortic Dissection
â€¢ False Aneurysm
â€¢ Pseudo Aneurysm
