pt bleeding actively onto gurney during exam.
No GI bleed diagnosed.  Pt expired of MSOF the following day.
Early frontal images reveal focal midline pelvic uptake, which over time increased, moved antegrade, and appeared to correspond with the rectal lumen.

enteric/colonic uptake of free 99mTc
Pt found down at home, covered in bloody stool and vomit, in altered mental status.  After massive crystalloid and blood product resuscitation, pt was brought to the nuclear medicine dept. for a 99mTc RBC GI bleeding scan.  At the time of scan, pt had active rectal bleeding.
Penile uptake of 99mTc-labeled RBC's is a common and potentially dangerous embarassing pitfall in 99mTc-RBC GI bleeding scans showing focal pelvic uptake.  As in this example, urinary flow and penile location and shape can approximate a rectal bleed such that definitive diagnosis can be difficult to impossible if based on frontal views alone.  Lateral and delayed views should be performed in any case of suspected pelvic bleed, and are valuable in clarifying the true source.
