fever
right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness
Axial CT with intravenous and oral contrast material demonstrates a large fluid collection predominantly within the porta hepatis around multiple surgical clips consistent with prior cholecystectomy.  More fluid is seen around the right lobe of the liver and more inferiorly within the right paracolic gutter.  Peritoneal fat around the fluid collection demonstrates stranding suggestive of inflammation.

Planar and SPECT images after the administration of Tc99m-disofenin IV demonstrates large amount of abnormal radiotracer accumulation within the area corresponding to the large fluid collection seen on the CT images, consistent with a biliary leak.  Note that a tubular area of radiotracer uptake leading from the large collection apparently outside the body is the collection within the percutaneous drainage tube placed prior to the scintigraphic study.
