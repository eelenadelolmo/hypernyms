Texto: 
Physical exam showed sensory deficits including sensation to  light touch, pinprick , vibration and proprioception, in the left and right legs up to level T2 and T3. Motor exam revealed hyporeflexia in the right leg and bilateral Babinski signs.
Patient was treated with azathioprine and steroids with near complete resolution of abnormal imaging findings.  Both the abnormal cord expansion and enhancement have largely resolved.
There is a large lesion involving most of the cervical spinal cord and  and a large portion of the thoracic spinal cord, extending from C2 to T9.

There is smooth cord expansion with mildly decreased signal intensity on the T1-weighted images. T2-weighted images demonstrate increased signal intensity and cord expansion. The lesion involves more than two thirds of the cross-sectional area of the cord.  Post-contrast images demonstrate multiple regions of patchy and nodular enhancement. There is also evidence of focal meningeal enhancement. 

The vertebrae and discs are not involved.
Transverse Myelitis
Spinal cord neoplasm 
Multiple sclerosis
Cord infarct
Syringohydromyelia
Neurosarcoid
48 year old female with history of leg weakness and loss of sensation for 3 weeks, severe ataxia for 3 days and increased urination for 1-2 days. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and lupus nephritis diagnosed in 1987.
Transverse myelitis is not a single diagnosis.  What is most important is to image the spinal cord to exclude other diseases - as well as clinical followup demonstrating resolution of signs and symptoms.
