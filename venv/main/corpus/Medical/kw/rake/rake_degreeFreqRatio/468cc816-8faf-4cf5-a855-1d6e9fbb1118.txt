Abdomen is tender to palpation.
HGB 12 yesterday this am 6.5 with repeat consistent.
The patient developed a small bowel obstruction with secondary aspiration and shortly thereafter expired
Left greater than right rectus abdominus masses with heterogeneous attenuation and fluid-fluid levels.  Left measuring 9 x 8cm superiorly and 7 x 9 cm inferiorly. The right measures 3 x 2cm. The left dissects inferiorly compressing the bladder with impression upon the rectum.
Rectus Hematoma
Traumatic abdominal wall hernia, Spigelian Hernia
86 F planning to discharge this am. Now with sudden drop in HGB, r/o bleed.
Rectus sheath hematoma is an ancient disorder first being accurately described by Hippocrates and mentioned by Galen. The first reported case in the United States was by Richardson in 1857.

The arcuate line, located approximately 5 cm below the umbilicus, functionally separates the rectus sheath into superior and inferior portions. Above the arcuate line, the aponeuroses of the external oblique, the internal oblique, and the transversalis muscles invest the rectus muscle. Three to four transverse tendinous inscriptions attach the rectus muscle to the enveloping fascia, usually above the arcuate line.

Below the arcuate line, the aponeuroses remain intact anteriorly, but only the weak transversalis fascia and peritoneum separate the muscle mass from the abdominal viscera posteriorly. The inferior retrorectus space communicates with the prevesicular space of Retzius. This communication creates a natural dissection plane between the posterior rectus sheath and the bladder.

The superior epigastric artery originates from the external thoracic artery; whereas, the inferior epigastric artery originates from the external iliac artery. It rises from the inguinal ligament to enter the posterior rectus sheath inferiorly. The inferior epigastric artery then ascends loosely between the rectus abdominis muscle and the posterior rectus sheath. During contractions of the rectus abdominis muscle, the length of the muscle changes, and the artery must glide with the muscle to avoid tearing. The combination of the loose attachment of the inferior epigastric artery with the stabilization of its perforating branches fixed to the muscle belly makes the artery prone to shearing stresses at branching sites during strong muscular contraction.

Rectus sheath hematomas can occur due to anticoagulation but also secondary to muscle contractions such as with retching or other activity.  

The course of rectus sheath hematoma is usually self limited with the bleeding tamponading itself and management conservative (reversal of anticoagulation, fluid resuscitation or transfusion). If bleeding persists or in large hemorrhage surgical treatment with hemostatic control and evacuation of the hematoma or interventional percutaneous areterial embolization may be required.
