Texto: 
Palpable lesion measuring approximately 2cm in diameter at the 10:00 position of the left breast approximately 5 cm from the nipple.  Patient expressed mild tenderness to palpation.
Patient requested elective surgical excision of this lesion, not yet performed.  Continued self breast examination with return to clinic for new/enlarging palpable abnormalities.  Commencement of annual screening mammography at age 40, or earlier if breast cancer in first degree relative.
Mammography not typically performed in a patient of this age as the generally very dense breast parenchyma obscures most lesions. As such, only ultrasound was performed of the lesion.

Ultrasound of the 10:00 position shows a 2.2 cm solid homogeneous mass with slightly increased through transmission.  The lesion has an ovoid configuration with smooth margins.  The lesion is wider than it is tall and is oriented transversely relative to the skin.

24 year old female presents with palpable abnormality in the left breast, 10:00 position, present for several months with intermittent tenderness.  Fine needle aspiration in the breast surgeons office without imaging guidance raised the question of atypical cells and core biopsy under ultrasound guidance was recommended. A left breast diagnostic US was performed first. If the US suggested a cystic leasion, a US-guided cyst aspiration would have been the next procedure.  Since the US indicated a solid mass, a core biopsy under US guidance was done. Since this patient is under 30 years old, an US was the first imaging study performed.
Imaging characteristics are not worrisome in this case.  Lesion could have been followed if prior FNA had not raised the question of atypia. However, many patients and surgeons like to have a tissue diagnosis if the plan is to follow a mass conservatively. 1.8% of well-circumscribed masses turn out to be well-circumscribed cancers.
