Hysterosalpingogram images demonstrate appearance of a bicornuate vs septate uterus. There is opacification of a Y shaped endometrial cavity. 

MR images demonstrating a septate uterus.  A fibrous septum between the two uterine horns demonstrates low signal intensity on both T1 and T2.  The fundal contour is minimally indented (4 mm) and the interconual distance is 36 mm.
