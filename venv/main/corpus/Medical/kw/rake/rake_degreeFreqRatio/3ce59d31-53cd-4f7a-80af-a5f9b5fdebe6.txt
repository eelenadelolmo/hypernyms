Texto: 
The collecting system and renal tubules appear normal. There are cylindrical collections of contrast in the renal papilla of the medulla of every calyx. This appearance is diagnostic of medullary sponge kidney.
Medullary Sponge Kidney
Renal papillary blush- this is caused by hyperconcentration of contrast material and is differentiated radiographically by the homogenous contrast enhancement of the renal papillary tips and absence of discrete collections of contrast and nephrocalcinosis.
Papillary necrosis- the calyx is abnormal and there are pools of contrast in the medulla. Papillary necrosis may be seen on retrograde pyelography but MSK is not.
Hematuria
MSK is also referred to as benign tubular ectasia occurs in 1 of 200 urograms and the cause is unknown. The disorder is rarely congenital and is usually detected in the third or fourth decade. There are cases of familial involvement suggesting a hereditary pattern but it is generally sporadic and considered to be a developmental abnormality. In most cases the involvement is bilateral and can involve every renal pyramid or it may be focal involving as few as one renal pyramid. The disorder results from tubular ectasia in the medulla distal to the calyx. 
MSK follows a benign course and in most cases is entirely asymptomatic. The major complication is increased incidence of nephrolithiasis resulting from urinary stasis in the ectatic tubules. The stasis results in precipitation of minerals resulting in a nidus for stone formation. These calcifications may be excreted into the calyces. Many radiologists prefer the term benign tubular ectasia in patients that do not have not have medullary calcinosis or a history of nephrolithiasis. This descriptive term may be a more accurate reflection of the natural history. MSK is associated with hemihypertrophy syndrome, Caroliâ€™s disease, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
The medullary calcinosis may be recognized on the scout film and it has a characteristic appearance after injection of intravenous contrast. The contrast fills the ectatic tubules resulting in saccular collections adjacent to the normal calyx.
