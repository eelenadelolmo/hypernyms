Patient was referred to Opthalmology for visual examination. Patient also received folllow up MRIs to ensure stability.
An MRI of the brain was performed and an enlarged left optic nerve sheath was identified. There was increased T2 SI circumferentially around the left optic nerve. Post IV Gadolinium images demonstrated abnormal enhancement surrounding the left optic nerve in the region of the optic nerve sheath extending to the anterior clinoid.
Meningioma
optic nerve sheath meningioma. sarcoid, lymphoma. less likely pseudotumor, optic neuritis.
