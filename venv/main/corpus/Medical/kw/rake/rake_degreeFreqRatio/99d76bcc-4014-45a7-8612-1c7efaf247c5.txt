Pulmonary Sequestration
Extralobar sequestration
Intralobar sequestration
CCAM (congential cystic adenomatoid malformation)
Hamartoma
Pneumonia
A 4 day old infant with a lung abnormality seen on a prenatal US.
Increasingly, congenital pulmonary malformations are diagnosed by prenatal sonography and/or magnetic resonance imaging.  It can be very difficult by imaging to differentiate the type of congenital pulmonary malformation, but if it persists into postnatal life, then surgical consultation is advised.
