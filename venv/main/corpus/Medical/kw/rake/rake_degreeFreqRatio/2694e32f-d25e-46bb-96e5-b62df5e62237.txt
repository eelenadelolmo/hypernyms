â€¢ Positive anterior drawer

â€¢ Positive pivot shift test
â€¢ Moderate joint laxity with valgus stress
Surgery for competitive athletes and adolescents using auto or allograft

Typically, ptâ€™s over the age of 50 are managed without surgery

Surgery is often delayed until associated injuries heal before ACL reconstruction is attempted
â€¢ Plain films showed soft tissue swelling about the knee and normal anatomical alignment/joint space, but no evidence of acute fracture or dislocation.

â€¢ MRI:  Substantial knee effusion.
Complete/Near complete disruption of deep fibers of MCL.    Complete midsubstance tear of the ACL.  Osseous edema of the lateral femoral condyle and proximal lateral tibia.  No evidence of meniscal or chondral injury
ACL Tear and Grade II MCL Sprain
â€¢ ACL Tear
â€¢ MCL injury
â€¢ Osteochondral fracture
This 21 y/o AD woman presents with left knee pain secondary to a fall while skiing.  She presented to ED 24 hours after a fall, with marked edema about the knee, that became apparent to the pt approximately 1-2 hrs post injury.

Past medical and social histories were not contributory.
ACL injuries are the most common ligamentous injury to the knee, with an estimated 100,000- 200,000 ACL ruptures per year in the US.  
Injury often occurs in football, soccer, basketball, and gymnastics.  Most common cause of non-contact ACL tears in older adults is skiing related.  Female athletes have a much higher propensity to get ACL tears than men, although the number of reported ACL tears is approximately equal among men and women.  Noncontact ACL tears account for approximately 70% of reported cases.  The remaining 30% are high or low energy contact injuries
Mechanism of injury in noncontact injuries typically involves internal rotation, especially with the leg in a valgus orientation.  Frequently associated with sudden decelerations and rapid changes in direction, as well as jumping/hyperextension.
Mechanism of injury for contact associated injuries usually involves application of a valgus stress to the knee with a planted foot (especially if it is internally rotated).  The mechanism of injury is unclear from the history given.  Noncontact injuries are very common with skiing related injuries (deceleration and changing direction/cutting).
