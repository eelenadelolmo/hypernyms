Infant in no acute distress
Standard upper gastrointestinal barium exam was performed and demonstrated normal esophagus/stomach.  The duodenum crosses midline from right to left, but not further than the left pedicle and approximately 1.5 vertebral bodies below the duodenal bulb.  Subsequent followup films demonstrate the majority of the jejunum on the right side of the abdomen and the ileum coursing to the left before joining the cecum in the right upper quadrant.
