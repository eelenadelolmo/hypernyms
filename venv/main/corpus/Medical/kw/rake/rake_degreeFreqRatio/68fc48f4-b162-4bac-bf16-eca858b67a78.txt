Planned Surgical Repair
Selected images taken from real time fluoroscopic upper gastrointestinal examination demonstrate a large diverticulum extending from the esophagus posteriorly. The diverticular mouth was calculated to be 1.3 cm, easily large enough to capture food, drink, or medication.
Zenker's Diverticulum
Zenker's Diverticulum
Killian-Jamieson Diverticulum
58 year old male with complains of several year history of “food sticking in his throat.”
Zenker’s diverticulum is a herniation of esophageal mucosa and submucosa through a defect in the posterior pharnygoesophageal junction. By definition this defect is through a known weakness, known as Killian’s dehiscence, between the horizontal and oblique fifers of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle. Zenker’s diveritcula extend posterolaterally from the esophagus and are best seen on lateral projections. Complications include dysphagia, halitosis, aspiration, and even perforation (more likely at endoscopy. Patients can be treated conservatively until symptoms are severe, but definitive treatment is surgical.
