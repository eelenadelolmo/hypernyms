Texto: 
large solid mass in the right flank.
A mildy enhancing large heterogeneous mass arises from the right kidney with areas of central hypodensity likely representing tumor necrosis. It measures 6.5 x 6.2 x 8.8 cm in the AP, transverse and craniocaudad dimensions, respectively. The right renal vein is not seen, hence cannot definitely exclude renal vein involvement.
Wilms' Tumor
Wilms Tumor
Unlikely considerations would include renal cell carcinoma or neuroblastoma.
with palpable abdominal mass.
