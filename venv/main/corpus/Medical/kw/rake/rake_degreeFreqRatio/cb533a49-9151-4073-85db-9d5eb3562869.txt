Texto: 
Generalized tenderness to palpation in lower abdomen and pelvis.  Labs non-contributory.
The treatment of this particular patient is unknown to the submitter.  These lesions are typically resected due to the propensity to cause torsion.
There are two pelvic masses noted.  The largest is eccentric to the right and anterior and measures 8 cm and contains fat, calcium and soft tissue.  The smaller left adnexal mass slightly posterior also contains fat and calcium.
