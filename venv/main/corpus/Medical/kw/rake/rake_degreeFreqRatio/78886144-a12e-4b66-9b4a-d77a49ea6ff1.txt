Erythemetous, tender left breast
Whole body bone scan with Tc-99m Medronate-  
Abnormal diffuse soft tissue uptake is noted with the left breast.  Intense, fusiform uptake is noted in the left posterior 11th rib.

CT chest -  Skin  and trabecular thickening are noted within the left breast.  There is asymmetric prominence of the left breast parenchyma without evidence of abscess.
Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma with involvement of the epidermis --- mastectomy
Differential Considerations for unilateral breast skin and trabecular thickening:
	Refractory mastitis
	Inflammatory carcinoma
	Post radiation mastitis
	Lymphatic/SVC obstruction
	Metastatic disease
36 y.o. female three months post-partum presents following treatment for bilateral mastitis with questionable abnormality on mammogram
