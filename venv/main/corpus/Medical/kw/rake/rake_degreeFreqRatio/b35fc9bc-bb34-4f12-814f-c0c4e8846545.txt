Normal laboratory values
Surgery
1. Normal right femoral artery
2. Right obturator hernia. Minimal bowel diliatation proximal to the herniation.
Obturator Hernia
None
45 year old female with Marfan's Disease.  She presents with a one-hour duration of a painful right inguinal region, which she states is a very similar pain as to when she had a dissection of her left femoral artery.
This study was with intravenous contrast only, as the diagnosis of exclusion was a femoral artery and aortic dissection, given the patient's medical history.
