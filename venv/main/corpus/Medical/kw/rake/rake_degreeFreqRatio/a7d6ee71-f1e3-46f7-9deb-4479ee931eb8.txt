Severe infection
32 yo man with shortness of breath.
This is a good example of stage 1 sarcoid, bilateral symmetric hilar adenopathy.  The patient’s shortness of breath resolved with bronchodilators and is scheduled for continued radiographic followup and was put on a steroid regimen.

Stages based on CXR:
Stage 0: normal film, 10%
Stage 1: adenopathy, 50%
	Symmetric hilar adenopathy
	Paratracheal, tracheobronchial, and azygos adenpathy is commonly associated with hilar adenopathy
	Calcification, 5%
Stage 2: adenopathy with pulmonary opacities, 30%
	Reticulonodular pattern
	Acinar pattern may coalesce to consolidation
	Large nodules >1cm (2%)
Stage 3: pulmonary opacities without hilar adenopathy, 10%
Stage 4: pulmonary fibrosis, upper lobes with bullae
Other less common plain film findings:
	Pleural effusion, 10%
	Unilateral hilar adenopathy, 1-3%
	Eggshell calcification of lymph nodes
	Complications of stage 3 include pneumothorax (blebs, bullae) and Aspergillus with fungus ball
	Bronchostenosis with lobar/segmental collapse
