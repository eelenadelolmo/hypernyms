Texto: 
Once significant pulmonary hemorrhage is suspected (frank hemoptysis or significant hemorrhage seen on CT), remove biopsy needle.  This will prevent further injury. Next, lay patient in a position so the blood collection will be dependent, to prevent aspiration into other lung regions. Administer O2 and consider admitting patient to hospital, with periodic re-scan.
First image demonstrates solitary pulmonary nodule in left lower lobe (patient prone on table). Second image shows biopsy needle in place with developing hemorrhage.  Last image shows blood-filled airspaces.
Pulmonary hemorrhage
The appearance of pulmonary hemorrhage on CT is non-specific, and resembles other airspace filling processes such as pneumonia, pulmonary edema, alveolar proteinosis.
Solitary pulmonary nodule on recent CT. Patient presents for biopsy.
