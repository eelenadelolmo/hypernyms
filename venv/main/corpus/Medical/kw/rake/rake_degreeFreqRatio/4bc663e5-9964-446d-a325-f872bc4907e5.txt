Texto: 
Not pregnant, not recently pregnant.
Prolactin level approximately 195 ng/ml, well above normal for non-pregnant.
A dopaminergic drug (e.g. bromocriptine) is often the treatment of choice for small prolactinomas.
Lesion is partly hypo- to iso- intense on pre-contrast images and hypointense with contrast. High pre-contrast T1 signal in the lesion may represent a small amount of hemorrhage.
