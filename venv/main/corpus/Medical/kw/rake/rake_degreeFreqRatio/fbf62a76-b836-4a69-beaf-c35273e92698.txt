There is a complex heterogenous suprasellar mass on the T2 weighted images which appears separate from the pituitary gland. On pre-contrast T1, there are some scattered areas of increased signal and there is mild enhancement following gadolinium administration. On the coronal sequence, the lesion appears to arise from the right optic nerve.

â€¢ Craniopharyngioma
