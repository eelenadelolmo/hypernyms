Radiation to spinal cord
Ring enhancing lesion within the cervical spinal cord at C3 and C4.  Moderate amount of edema above and below tumor.
Metastatic lung cancer, intramedullary spinal cord mass
â€¢ Ependymoma
â€¢ Astrocytoma
â€¢ Abscess
â€¢ Intramedullary spinal cord metastasis
47 year old woman, previously treated for lung cancer metastatic to brain.
This spinal cord lesion was seen on routine follow up MRI brain study.  This patient was also recently diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer. There was no increased activity of the spinal cord mass on I 131 scan indicating that it likely a metastatic lesion from lung and not thyroid gland.
