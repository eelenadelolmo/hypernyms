History of Present Illness 

Patient is an 81-year-old African American female who was involved in a vehicular accident. She reports that around that time period of the accident she was retired and not working. The patient reports she was the driver of the vehicle traveling 20-25 miles per hour when another vehicle ‚Äúran a red light‚Äù. She reports that this other vehicle struck the front fender driver‚Äôs side of the vehicle she was in, causing damage to her vehicle. She said that when the impact occurred she is unsure whether she lost consciousness. She reports no blood loss and no air bag deployment. She reports that an ambulance did arrive but a friend picked her up and drove her home. Later she went to the hospital where she was examined, radiographs preformed, and it was determined that the left side of her head struck the frame of the vehicle and she had pain over the left frontal portion of her head. She reports no medications were prescribed other than acetaminophen. She reports being released that day.

Prior to the MVA the patient reports that she had moderate lower back pain that was localized with no lower extremity pain. After the accident, she reports that the pain is more significant and radiating down both extremities to her ankles. She reports neck pain that radiates down both shoulders. Patient complains of frontal headaches.

Past Medical History

Patient had a vertebral body resection and lumbar fusion. Patient received prior chiropractic care years prior after reports of lower back pain. She had multiple MVAs that caused injury to her lumbar spine. She had a significant fall years prior that resulted in a minimally displaced fracture of the posterolateral aspect of the left 7th rib, rotator cuff tear as well as lumbar and cervical strain. Patient underwent left knee replacement after 25 years of corticosteroid injections.

Patient denies diabetes, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, allergies, kidney disease, tuberculosis, shortness of breath, hearing loss, heart disease, kidney stones, headaches, cancer, gout, seizures, asthma, ulcers, loss of sight, stroke or any fractures. 

She reports having surgery to her left foot, fifth digit. She reports having a hysterectomy and a thyroidectomy. She reports taking thyroid medication since that time. She reports having a cholecystectomy as well.

Patient reports taking gabapentin, iron supplements, vitamin D, Vitamin B-12, and fish oil.

Motor vehicle accidents have been known to cause significant structural changes to a patient‚Äôs spinal anatomy which results in real clinical findings. These changes can be more damaging to those who have underlying spinal instability and immobility. The patient in the case has a prior history of spinal instability with lumbar fusion in earlier that year, before her motor vehicle accident..  After which she reported a change in intensity and frequency of the lower back pain, as well as neck pain that radiated to bilateral shoulders and frontal headaches. Radiologic imaging showed disc protrusion at L2-3, extending into the spinal canal with associated hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum.  This is the level directly adjacent to her lumbar fusion. Physical examination revealed decrease range of movement in flexion, extension and bending. Straight leg raise elicited pain bilaterally down to the ipsilateral calf.  These radiologic and physical findings support the patient‚Äôs clinical presentation of lower back pain with radiation down bilateral legs. Lumbar fusion is used to decrease spinal column instability (1). By doing such a procedure, the distribution of forces change from being evenly distributed throughout all vertebral levels to adding additional stress to the adjacent segments to fusion. This means that the adjacent vertebrae must increase their angle of flexion and in doing so, creates an area of vulnerability (2).  Large forces, such as that generated by a motor vehicle accident, act on that area of vulnerability and the adjacent vertebrae is unable to effectively deal with the stress. This causes structural responses such as disc herniation, ligamentous strain and subluxation as a result of this large force (3).  Radiography of the thoracic spine of levels T5-T6 and T6-T7 showed minimal posterior bulge that was not a significant contributor to the patient's clinical presentation. 

The large force generated by the motor vehicle accident was translated through the cervical spine. Evaluation of the neck pain revealed underlying disc herniation in C3-C4, C5-C6 and C6-C7 with a cervical T2 weighted MRI. Further evaluation with a digital motion (DMX) study showed mild retrolithesis in C4-C5, and mild anterolithesis in C5-C6 and C6-C7 which indicated anterior and posterior longitudinal ligament instability respectively.  The DMX study was digitized using and the report supported the instability findings throughout the cervical spine (4-11). The program for digitizing yields best results with DICOM images and lesser resolution using JPEG version of the DMX. The results using the digitized end plate analysis supported findings from the DMX study. The EMG study showed abnormal needle EMG findings in the left and right upper extremities consistent with bilateral C5 radiculopathies. The combination of disc herniation, ligamental instability and radiculopathy manifest in the patients physical findings of decreased flexion, extension, rotation and lateral bending and clinical presentation of neck pain that radiated to bilateral shoulders. 

The patient also reported increased pain in her left shoulder compared to her right.  Physical examination showed no difference in degree of elevation between shoulders. She had a positive Neer‚Äôs test on the left shoulder, positive Hawkins-Kennedy and supraspinatus procedures bilaterally. MRI imaging of the left shoulder showed a SLAP tear of the superior glenoid labrum, as well as left supraspinatus tendinopathy and acromioclavicular joint arthropathy.  Due to complaints of frontal headaches,  MRI of the brain was ordered by the patient‚Äôs neurologist. Results from the images showed vascular ischemic disease with corresponding white matter and lacunar infarcts. No masses, tumors or areas of acute infarct were seen. It was noted that the ventricles are dilated which suggests hydrocephalus but no other clues to the origins of the frontal headaches were found. Also to note, imaging of the patient‚Äôs right hip was obtained by the orthopedic physician. Aside from arthritic changes, no other useful information was obtained that pertained to this case. 

Patient began chiropractic treatment as well as maintaining conservative management. Chiropractic treatment included soft tissue manipulation of the full spine, Flexion-Distraction- Decompression therapy for the lumbar spine, Quantum exercise to strengthen the lower back and ultrasound therapy to the lumbosacral regions.  Patient completed a Durable Medical Equipment (DME) satisfaction survey to evaluate her satisfaction of the lumbar brace, cervical traction device, multi-mode electrical stimulation unit that she was provided. Her generally positive responses indicate that she is satisfied with the devices and that they meet her needs. Patient feels that she has been provided some relief through chiropractic care and has made improvement in her pain and mobility.
