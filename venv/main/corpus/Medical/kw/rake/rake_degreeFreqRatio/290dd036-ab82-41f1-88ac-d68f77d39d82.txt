Texto: 
Obvious hyperextension of the left 3rd distal ray with bone protruding through a soft tissue defect in the volar aspect of the digit.
Patient was refered to orthopedics for further care and management, to include reduction.
Ulnar-dorsal dislocation of the 3rd left distal phalanx.  The head of the 3rd proximal phalanx has torn through the volar surface of the finger.  Aside from a small corner fracture at the radial aspect of the dislocated phananx base, no other fractures are present.
Traumatic Phalanx Dislocation
None
41yo male who caught a ‚Äúfly-ball‚Äù during a softball game, now with deformation, pain, and profuse bleeding.
Despite playing with a "soft" ball, enough force was generated by the direct impaction on the tip of the finger to cause forcful hyperextension and an open dislocation.  Patient will likely wear a softball glove when playing from now on.
