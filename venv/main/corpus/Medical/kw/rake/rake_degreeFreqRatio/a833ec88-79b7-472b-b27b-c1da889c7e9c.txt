Texto: 
Treatment is focused on treatment of the lung cancer, and with successful treatment of the primary disease, the hypertrophic osteoarthropathy can dramatically improve or resolve completely.
Whole body osseous scintigraphy was performed.  No focally intense radiotracer uptake was seen to suggest osteoblastic metastases.  However, irregular periosteal uptake is noted in the femoral diaphyses and metaphyses bilaterally.
Hypertrophic Pulmonary Osteoarthropathy (based on clinical presentation and radiographic findings only)
Differential considerations based on scintigraphic appearance may include: (It should be noted that in this case the scintigraphic appearance virtually excludes the other three entities noted under "Common" DDx possibilities.

Common:
Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy 
Fibrous Dysplasia 
Paget Disease 
Metastatic disease

Uncommon:
Caffey Disease 
Acromegaly
Endosteal hyperostosis (van Buchem disease)
Macrodystrophia lipomatosa
Proteus syndrome
43 year old male originally presented with cough.  Chest radiograph showed a left upper lobe consolidation and he was treated with antibiotics.  He failed a two week course of antibiotics and returned for follow up medical care.  A chest CT showed a large round irregularly bordered mass in the left upper lobe.  Biopsy of the lesion lead to the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the lung.  The patient then presented to our service for osseous scintigraphy to evaluate for bony metastatic disease.
This finding was discovered after the diagnosis of lung carcinoma was made and a bone scan was performed to search for metasases.  But, often patients undergoing bone scan for other reasons are discovered to have "HO", which leads to the diagnosis of the etiologic entity.

In addition to pulmonary diseases (which when in association with this periosteal proliferation often results in "HO" being called "hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy"), mediastinal, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal diseases are often associated with "HO".  The "HO" can be reversed with elimination of the inciting process.

The scintigraphic finding is often evident before radiographic changes are evident.
