Patient developed intermittent upper extremity pain and paresthesias bilaterally at 1 month post-MVC. Upper extremity reflexes 2+, intact light and pinprick sensation, and 5/5 strength bilaterally without focal motor deficits. 

Type: Upper extremity NCS/Needle EMG

ELECTRODIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS:
1. Normal distal motor latencies and amplitudes of the right and left Median & Ulnar nerves.
2. Normal F-responses of the right and left Median & Ulnar nerves.
3. Normal distal sensory latencies and amplitudes of the right and left Median, Ulnar and Superficial Radial
nerves.
4. Normal right and left Median H-reflexes.
5. Normal needle EMG examination of the right and left upper limb and cervical paraspinal muscles.

CONCLUSIONS: There are normal sensory and motor nerve conduction studies of the right and left upper
extremities. Late responses including Median H-reflexes and F-waves are present and symmetrical bilaterally
without prolongation.
There was a normal monopolar needle EMG examination. There were no evidence of increased insertional
activity, spontaneous potentials or chronic neuropathic motor units encountered in any of the sampled upper
limb & cervical paraspinal muscles upon monopolar needle EMG thus, cervical radiculopathy could not be
verified at this time. However, I cannot rule out cervical radiculopathy.

IMPRESSION: This individual exhibits electrophysiological findings consistent with the following:
1. No electrophysiological evidence of a cervical radiculopathy, focal upper extremity entrapment
neuropathy, brachial plexopathy, upper extremity peripheral polyneuropathy, or myopathy was observed.
2. Cervical spine musculoligamentous and/or discogenic origin of pain are suspected as pain generators in
this case.
3. Although unrelated to his motor vehicle crash, nonetheless, a neurosurgical spine evaluation is also
suggested for further evaluation of his Chiari malformation and significant syringomyelia noted on MRI.
Goals of treatment is to restore the proper flow of cerebrospinal fluid and to remove the pressure that a syrinx places on the spinal cord. The general therapeutic options include: pain medications, physical therapy, and reduction in activities, especially those that require straining such as heavy lifting. Also, treatment of the underlying cause of the syringomyelia should be addressed if possible. If there is a symptomatic Chiari malformation, then posterior fossa decompression can be performed to relieve pressure and reduce compression of the brainstem. If hydrocephalus has developed, a shunt can be placed that connects the dilated ventricles of the brain to another cavity of the body often the abdomen. Also, shunt/stent can be placed into the syrinx allowing fluid to drain outside of the spinal column which can relieve some symptoms such as pain and headaches. Another option is to expand the area around the site of trauma to decrease fluid volume. However, shunts or spinal surgery can be associated with significant side effects including spinal cord injury or infection, hemorrhage, and blockage and often are reserved for patients with no other options. 

This patient was asked to utilize general therapeutic options including as needed pain medication, chiropractic services, and activity reduction. He has been following closely with the chiropractor with improvement. Three months after the MVC, the patient still has pain in his neck and mid-back regions, however, he states that it has greatly improved. He still denies shoulder pain or difficulties with ambulation. The headaches and upper extremity paresthesias have resolved. 

The patient was referred to neurosurgery for evaluation of the syringomyelia and Chiari I malformation. The neurosurgeon's assessment diagnosed the patient with neck pain without myelopathy or radiculopathy with a fairly significant upper thoracic syrinx that is comprising 80-90% of the spinal cord diameter with a borderline Chiari I malformation. Also of note were the slight disc bulging at C5-6 and congenital autofusion at C4-5 and C7-T1. The neurosurgeon's recommended plan discussed conservative management versus surgical intervention. Conservative management could include such therapies as pain medications, physical therapy, chiropractic care, traction, and epidural injections. Surgical intervention would occur in the form of Chiari decompression and could occur in the near future as a prophylactic measure. The discussion of the natural history of this disease process included possible future development of myelopathy, difficulty with gait, balance, numbness, weakness, and bladder and bowel dysfunction. The possibility of acute myelopathic deterioration caused by another motor vehicle collision or fall was also discussed. 

At this time, the patient is waiting for an MRI with contrast to evaluate for an underlying benign tumor. Also, he is considering surgical intervention, continuing conservative management, and following up with neurosurgery and chiropractic services.
CERVICAL SPINE 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post MVA.  Assess for traumatic injury. 

FINDINGS:  Lateral neutral, lateral flexion, lateral extension and AP views of the cervical spine were performed.  Cervical vertebral body heights are well maintained.  There is intervertebral disc space narrowing at the C4-C5 level.  Straightening of the normal lordotic curvature of the cervical spine which may be due to muscular spasm.  There is evidence for retrolisthesis of C6 over C7 in lateral neutral view.  On flexion view there is a slight anterolisthesis of C2 over C3 and C3 over C4.  On extension view there is retrolisthesis of C3 over C4 and C6 over C7. Prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable. 

IMPRESSION:  
1.	DEGENERATIVE DISC DISEASE AT C4-C5 LEVEL. 
2.	RETROLISTHESIS OF C6 OVER C7 SEEN ON LATERAL NEUTRAL VIEW AS WELL AS ON EXTENSION VIEW.  THERE IS ANTEROLISTHESIS OF C2 OVER C3 AND C3 OVER C4 SEEN ON FLEXION VIEW.  I WOULD RECOMMEND CLINICAL CORRELATION. 


LUMBOSACRAL SPINE 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post MVA.

FINDINGS:  AP, lateral neutral, lateral flexion and lateral extension views of the lumbosacral spine were performed.  Lumbosacral vertebral body heights are well maintained.  There is intervertebral disc space narrowing at the L5-S1 level.  Straightening of the normal lordotic curvature of the lumbosacral spine which may be due to muscular spasm.  I do not appreciate evidence for anterolisthesis or retrolisthesis on flexion and extension views. 

IMPRESSION:  
1.	MILD DEGENERATIVE DISC DISEASE NOTED AT THE L5-S1 LEVEL. 
2.	STRAIGHTENING OF THE NORMAL LORDOTIC CURVATURE OF THE LUMBOSACRAL SPINE WHICH MAY BE DUE TO MUSCULAR SPASM. 
3.	NO EVIDENCE FOR ANTEROLISTHESIS OR RETROLISTHESIS ON FLEXION AND EXTENSION VIEWS. 


MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  Neck pain due to injury during MVA. 

IMAGING SEQUENCES:  Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and STIR and stacked angled axial gradient echo and T2-weighted MRI of the cervical spine was performed. 

FINDINGS:  No acute fractures or dislocations are seen.  No destructive bony changes or bone marrow edema or contusion is seen.  Partly fused block vertebrae at the C4-5 and C7-T1 levels are noted with vestigial disc spaces noted.  There is developmental fusion and ankylosis of the facet joints bilaterally at the C4-5 disc level with residual articular facets at the C7-T1 disc level.  Associated vestigial discs are noted without disc herniation, central or foraminal stenoses.  The remainder of vertebral heights are maintained.  The remainder of pedicles are intact.  No facet malalignment is seen.  The craniocervical alignment and atlantoaxial articulation are unremarkable.  Inferior extension of cerebellar tonsils consistent with Chiari I malformation is noted with associated syringomyelia in the visualized thoracic spinal canal from T2 to T4 measuring approximately 6.5 mm in maximum diameter.  Further evaluation with MRI of the thoracic spine for full evaluation of the spinal cord is recommended. 

There is prominent straightening of the cervical lordosis likely due to muscle spasm. 
At the C2-3 disc level, no disc herniation, central or foraminal stenoses are seen. 
Minimal hypertrophy of the uncovertebral joint at the C3-4 disc level noted slightly encroaches on the foramina with associated minimal anterior spurring and minimal posterior ridging without posterior herniation, central or foraminal stenosis. 
At the C5-6 disc level, subtle posterior bulge is noted minimally indenting the ventral thecal sac. 
The C6-7 disc level is within normal limits. 
The T1-2, T2-3 and T3-4 disc levels are within normal limits. 

IMPRESSION:  
1.	NO EVIDENCE FOR FRACTURE OR ACUTE BONE ABNORMALITIES. 
2.	STRAIGHTENING OF CERVICAL LORDOSIS LIKELY DUE TO MUSCLE SPASM. 
3.	PARTLY FUSED DEVELOPMENTAL BLOCK VERTEBRAE AT THE C4-5 AND C7-T1 DISC LEVELS.

FURTHER EVALUATION WITH MRI OF THE THORACIC SPINE FOR FULL ASSESSMENT OF THE SPINAL CORD IS RECOMMENDED. 


MRI OF THE THORACIC SPINE: 
CLINICAL INDICATIONS:  Syringomyelia partially visualized on MRI of the cervical spine.  Patient with history of MVA with injury.  Patient with neck and back pain.  

IMAGING SEQUENCES:  Axial and sagittal images of the thoracic spine were obtained utilizing multiple pulse sequences.  

FINDINGS:  Alignment of the thoracic vertebrae is maintained in the sagittal plane.  The disc spaces are relatively maintained.  There is no focal marrow replacement or marrow edema of the thoracic vertebrae.  
Markedly prominent syringomyelia is noted at the thoracic spinal cord most prominently centered at the T3-4 level measuring approximately 6 mm in greatest diameter.  Less prominent syringomyelia is noted spanning from the T1 through T7 levels.  
There is no significant central canal stenosis, foraminal stenosis or posterior disc protrusion on any level of the thoracic spine.  

IMPRESSION:   
MARKEDLY PROMINENT SYRINGOMYELIA IS DEMONSTRATED AT THE THORACIC SPINE, MOST PROMINENTLY AT THE T3-4 LEVEL BUT SPANNING FROM THE T1 THROUGH T7 LEVELS.


CERVICAL RADIOGRAPHIC INSTABILITY REPORT:

The Endplate Analysis for this area of the spine (constructing tangential lines from inferior vertebrae C2-7) has been noted in the scientific literature for objective analysis of vertebral segmental alignment in the neutral, flexion, and extension views. This method was adopted by the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment as a method to discriminate an alteration of motion segment integrity (AOMSI) suggestive of an unstable spine. AOMSI has been defined as abnormal motion equal to or exceeding 11° of angular movement and/or 3.5mm of translational slippage (break in "George's Line") relative to adjacent vertebral segments. Such excessive movement is indicative of ligamentous sub-failure as well as possible disc damage. Consequently, a patient may be rateable for a permanent injury upon reaching maximal medical improvement should these alterations of spinal biomechanics persist. Regarding the magnitude of translational slippage (break in "George's Line") other researchers have argued that 3.5mm is simply too large of a displacement of magnitude seldom observed in clinical practice and that clinical relevance should be noted at motion ranging from lower thresholds of 1.0-3.0mm indicating subluxation. Others have noted, “To adopt 3.5mm of translation as the minimum criterion for anterior subluxation is to leave the majority of mild to moderate instability unclassified.”

In the flexion position, there are no ratable levels for angular instability nor for translational instability. Threshold for angular excursion should not exceed 11° more than adjacent levels. Also noted in this global flexed position is subluxation (break in "George's Line") of C2-C3 with 1.1 mm, C6-C7 with -1.2 mm, C7-T1 with 1.0 mm. Absolute threshold cutoff is defined by the AMA Guides as translation slippage (break in "George's Line") of greater than 3.5mm. In this position, there are no ratable levels of abnormal translational slippage instability (break in "George's Line"). In the extension position, there are some ratable levels for angular instability but no ratable levels for translational instability. Increase in angulation is noted at C4-C5 of 7.6º compared to C3-C4 of -7.3º which is > 11º difference at 14.9º, which may be of clinical significance. Threshold for angular excursion should not exceed 11° more than adjacent levels. Also noted in this global extended position is subluxation (break in "George's Line") of C2-C3 with -1.1 mm, C3-C4 with -2.7 mm, C5-C6 with -3.1 mm. Absolute threshold cutoff is defined by the AMA Guides as translation slippage (break in "George's Line") of greater than 3.5mm. In this position, there are no ratable levels of abnormal translational slippage instability (break in "George's Line"). For translational instability, Posner proposed a normal limit of 2.3 mm for L1–L4 vertebrae or 8 % of endplate length, and 1.6 mm, or 6 % of endplate length, for L5. As per authors, instability in the cervical spine can be understood as being 1.6mm A to P movement [1]  

Using the Penning system of analysis, the patient's cervical spine was analyzed using computerized method and total motion at each segmental level was assessed. Penning’s Analysis for cervical spine stability has been shown to be one of the most valid methods for assessing total range of motion from flexion to extension. The patient was found to have excessive motion exceeding normal ranges found in the literature. This was for C6-C7 of 17.9º. Consequently, ligamentous instability and loss of motion segment integrity exists at this level when assessing for total movement from the flexion to extension position. At no levels did the total motion exceed that of normal ranges.

Patient is an 18-year-old African American Male who was involved in a MVC. He was a restrained driver traveling 10 mph when he was struck head-on by a car traveling 30 mph. He was thrown forwarded into the steering wheel and then slammed back into the driver seat. He does not know what part of his body struck the steering wheel, however, he was looking forward when the impact occurred. The airbags did not deploy, he did not lose consciousness, nor experience any bleeding at the time of the accident. Immediately after the collision, he felt dizzy, dazed, weak, disoriented, and nervous. He described difficulties standing, walking, riding, bending, twisting, and lifting. 

On presentation to the office one day after the MVC, he described pain in his neck, mid-back, and lower back regions. This pain he rated at a 7-8/10 and described it as sharp, stabbing, dull, and deep pain. He says that it worsened when bending over or moving side-to-side. The pain improves with rest and Tylenol. He denied shoulder pain, pain radiating down any of his four extremities, and loss of bowel and bladder control. He also complained of a frontal headache.

One month after the MVC, he described paresthesias and intermittent pain that radiated distally down both of his upper extremities. Nerve conduction study and needle EMG of both upper extremities were performed which were negative. The cause of these paresthesias was suspected to be musculoligamentous, discogenic, or inflammatory in nature.

Review of systems
Patient denied loss of appetite, chills, dizziness, fainting, fever, forgetfulness, low energy, nervousness, numbness, sleep loss, sweats, weight gain or weight loss. He also denied any problems with his eyes, ears, nose, throat, heart, lungs, stomach, skin, blood, urogenital, or social/emotional conditions. 

Past Medical History
Unspecified medical condition as an infant that required a liver transplant from an HLA-matched donor. Liver transplant was curative. Immunosuppressant medications were discontinued by the family many years previous due to adverse effects suffered by the patient. Patient describes no complications.
Patient denies any other past medical condition. He denies previous sports injuries, accidents, or motor vehicle collisions.

This patient was found to have a syringomyelia and Chiari I malformation on imaging following a traumatic motor vehicle collision. Was this syringomyelia caused by the trauma or was it present before the accident and associated with the Chiari I malformation?

Post-traumatic syringomyelia can form following an Injury to the spinal cord. Post-traumatic syringomyelia should be suspected in patients with delayed or progressive neurologic deterioration following traumatic spinal injury with “fixed deficits” or an alternative presentation may include delayed sensory or motor complaints without initial neurologic impairment [1]. Patients with complete spinal cord injuries and those >30 years old have been found to be at an increased risk of syrinx formation within 5 years of the traumatic event [2]. Studies found that CT imaging showed an incidence of post-traumatic syringomyelia of 1-5% while MR imaging has shown an incidence up to 22% [3].

On the other hand, syringomyelia is diagnosed in 65% of patients with Chiari I malformation, therefore, there is a strong association between these two disorders [4]. However, the exact causes of both Chiari I malformation and syringomyelia are still unknown. Some studies have shown evidence of familial aggregation of Chiari I malformation and syringomyelia [5,6,7,8,9]. More recently, a case series involving identical and fraternal twins showed a higher concordance rate in the identical twins supporting the idea that Chiari I malformation has genetic factors [10]. In addition, familial clustering was observed in another study that examined 364 patients with Chiari I malformations with 12% of these patients reporting that they had at least one close relative with Chiari I malformation and/or syringomyelia [11].

Some progress has been made in discovering the genetics of Chiari I malformation. One study conducted a genome screen on 23 families with individuals with Chiari I malformations and found a gene association on chromosomes 9 and 15 [12]. This study also showed that the volume of the posterior fossa was a heritable attribute for Chiari I malformation while the degree of cerebellar tonsil herniation did not correlate.

The heritability of Chiari I malformation can also be speculated upon because of its association with other known genetic conditions. These disorders co-segregate with Chiari I malformation and affect mesodermally-derived cartilage and/or bone such as achondroplasia, Klippel Feil sequence, Hadju-Cheney syndrome, Albright Hereditary Osteodystrophy (pseudohypoparathyroidism), familial hypophosphatemia rickets, and spondylo-epiphyseal dyplasia tarda [13,14]. 

Finally, Chiari I malformations and syringomyelias have been found to be a common disorder in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels [15,16]. Studies have shown a genetic basis for heritability. This could provide an important animal model for further investigation to identified genes and/or treatment strategies.

It is speculated that Chiari I malformation and syringomyelia have genetic components, however, only familial aggregation has been confirmed. The genetic components have been difficult to discern as the exact causes of Chiari I malformation and syringomyelia have yet to be determined.

In summary, this patient's syringomyelia has a high probability of association with the Chiari I malformation, however, the patient denied having any family members who have been diagnosed with Chiari I malformation and/or syringomyelia. There is a possibility that this patient developed a post-traumatic syringomyelia as a result of the motor vehicle collision. The evaluation by the neurosurgeon did however include the diagnosis of syrinx.  Relative to causality, the neurosurgeon indicates that based on the information available, it is his opinion that the motor vehicle accident is the competent and producing cause of the patient's spinal conditions.  Whether the syrinx was present prior to the accident or is a direct result of the accident or a combination of both is not entirely clear.  What is clear is that the neurosurgeon feels that were it not for the accident the symptoms and resultant clinical picture would not occur.  The neurosurgeon then is causally-relating the need for surgical intervention for the syrinx to the motor vehicle accident.
