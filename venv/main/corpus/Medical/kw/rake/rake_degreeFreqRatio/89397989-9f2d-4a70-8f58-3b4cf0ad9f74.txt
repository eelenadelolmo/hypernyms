Patient received surgery to fix the hernia.  Subsequent radiographs demonstrated eventration of the right hemidiaphragm.
Large right hemithorax mass seen on the PA view.

Silhouette sign of the right heart border.

Gas pockets within the superior portion of the mass.  

Lateral image demonstrates the mass to be anterior in the chest.
Morgagni Hernia
Morgagni hernia
Pericardial cyst
Pericardial fat pad
27 year old woman complaining of cough receives PA and lateral chest radiographs.
This is a rather large example in an asymptomatic adult.  This case may have required a CT if there weren't scattered gas bubbles in the mass to clue the interpreter that this is a hernia, not a pericardial cyst.
