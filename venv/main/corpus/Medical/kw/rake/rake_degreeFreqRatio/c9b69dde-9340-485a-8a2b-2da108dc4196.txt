AFP, Testosterone, bHCG, and LDH were all witnin normal limits.
Patient was treated by radical orchiectomy. Subsequent imaging was negative for evidence of metastatic disease.
Testicular ultrasound demonstrate 2 well-defined hypoechoic, hypervascular lesions in the left testis as well as diffuse microlithiases. One of the lesions abuts the tunica albuginea with direct invasion not excluded.
Seminoma - Dx path proven.
