Thin, elderly female with marked kyphosis.

Labs are significant for a serum PTH of 127 (normal range, 15-65), calcium 11.8, and phosphorus 2.4.
Surgery for removal of the adenoma.
Tc-99m Sestamibi scan (21.8 mCi IV) at 20-minutes and 2-hours post injection.  20-minute scan demonstrates diffuse uptake within the thyroid gland with a focus of increased uptake in the region of the left lower pole, which persists on the 2-hour scan.

Parathyroid Hyperplasia
82 year old female with primary hyperparathyroidism, right hip fracture, and multiple vertebral body compression fractures.
Parathyroid imaging is done at WRAMC using TC-99m sestamibi with a dosage of 20 mCi IV.  Scanning is performed 20-minutes and 2-hours post injection.  The imaging is based on the differential uptake and washout of the radiotracer from the thyroid and parathyroid.  A parathyroid adenoma should have avid uptake of the radiotracer, and at 2-hours increased uptake should be seen in the adenoma while the radiotracer is expected to have washed out from the thyroid gland.   False positives may result from increased uptake secondary to a thyroid adenoma.  If no increased focus of uptake is seen on the planar images, additional tomographic (SPECT) images can be obtained.

It is important to note that the parathyroid scan is not used to diagnose hyperparathyroidism.  This is a diagnosis made based on laboratory and clinical findings. The parathyroid scan is used to identify and localize parathyroid adenomas in a patient for which surgery is being planned.
