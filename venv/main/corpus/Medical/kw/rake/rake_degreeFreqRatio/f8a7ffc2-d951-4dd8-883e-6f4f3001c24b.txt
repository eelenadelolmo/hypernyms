spontaneous, yellow, guiac negative nipple discharge bilaterally
none
A ductogram was performed on the left, following cannulation of an orifice at 3:00.  A small, circumscribed filling defect was apparent approximately 3 cm from the nipple.  The ducts were normal in caliber and regular in contour.
	Ductogram of the right breast (not shown) demonstrated duct ectasia but no other abnormality. 
	Follow up of ductogram on the left, again following cannulation at 3:00, performed approximately one month later demonstrated a normal caliber ductal system with no filling defects.
Filling Defects at Ductography
Differential:  (filling defects at ductography)
1.	Papillary lesion (papilloma or papillomatosis)
2.	Papillary carcinoma or DCIS
3.	Debris in the duct lumen
4.	Hematoma
5.	Air bubble
a 38 year old woman with bilateral spontaneous nipple discharge, which was yellow in color and guiac negative.
Ductography is most frequently performed in the evaluation of patients with unilateral, spontaneous nipple discharge.  The most common cause of these symptoms is a papilloma, but papillary carcinomas are indistinguishable by imaging.  Clear or sanguineous discharge is more frequently associated with a malignant lesion.  Lesions identified at ductography are treated by duct excision.
	Ductography is accomplished by expression of a small amount of discharge from the affected nipple orifice.  The duct is then cannulated with a blunt, 30-gauge needle, and 0.2-0.3cc of water soluble contrast is injected.  Orthogonal magnification views are then obtained.  Filling defects within the ductal system may reflect a papilloma, papillary carcinoma, or intraductal debris.  Air bubbles may also cause filling defects and efforts should be made to clear bubbles from the syringe and tubing prior to injection.
	Papillomas secrete large quantities of fluid.  They may present as ductal filling defects with dilation of the downstream duct (that is, the portion of the duct closer to the nipple) because of hyper secretion.  Alternatively, a papilloma may cause complete obstruction of the duct and result in a &#8220;cut off&#8221; appearance on ductography.  Findings may be similar for carcinomas; examination of the tissues adjacent to the duct may yield additional evidence of malignancy.
