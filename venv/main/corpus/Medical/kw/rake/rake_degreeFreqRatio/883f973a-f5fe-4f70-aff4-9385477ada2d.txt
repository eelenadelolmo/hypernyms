PE: Icteric sclera. Jaundiced skin. 

Laboratory: Obstructive hyperbilirubinemia.
Since metallic ducts become incorporated into the epithelium and will eventually occlude, they typically are not be used for benign biliary strictures to avoid having to sacrifice additional biliary duct during surgical reconstruction. Instead, internal/external biliary stenting with large silastic catheters are preferred. Catheters are routinely changed every 2 to 3 months over an average period of 6 months to a year. Successful completion of a clinical trail and/or biliary manometric profusion test is required prior to stent removal.
Image 1: Percutaneous cholangiography via a lateral approach into the right intrahepatic biliary ducts demonstrating severe long segment stenoses of the proximal right and left intrahepatic biliary ducts which probably included the anstamoses with the choledochojejunostomy. There is early reflux into the proximal left intrahepatic biliary ducts.

Image 2: Placement of a 10 French silastic catheter across the long segment stenosis of the right intrahepatic and right biliary duct into the jejunum.

Image 3: Catheter repositioned to maximize drainage of both hepatic lobes through the multiple side ports.
Benign biliary stricture
Possible etiologies for stricture:
1) Sequela of pancreatitis via associated ascending cholangitis.
2) Inflammation related to surgery.
60 year old male re-presents with painless jaundice several months after undergoing a Whipple procedure for a pancreatic head mass. Denies fever, itching. Wife denies mental status changes. Pathologic analysis of the resected pancreatic head mass had revealed sequelae of chronic pancreatitis.
Because the patient's asymptomatic jaundice did not resolve after the placement of this catheter, a second internal/external biliary stent was placed via a more anterior approach into the left intrahepatic biliary ducts.
