Texto: 
No complaint of ankle pain.
No further workup required.
AP and lateral radiographs of the right ankle demonstrate a 3x2cm well-defined lucent lesion along the lateral aspect of the distal right tibia. The lesion is slightly expansile with sclerotic margins. There is no periosteal reaction.
Nonossifying Fibroma - The diagnosis was made based on history and radiographic appearance.
1. Non-ossifying fibroma
2. Fibrous Dysplasia
3. Infection
4. Fibrous Histiocytoma
23 year old active duty white male with "suspicious" bone lesion seen on earlier ankle radiograph following previous ankle sprain.  Previous radiograph was from outside institution.
In a patient under the age of thirty, without periostitis or pain, a cortically based lesion with this radiographic appearance is most likely a non-ossifying fibroma.
