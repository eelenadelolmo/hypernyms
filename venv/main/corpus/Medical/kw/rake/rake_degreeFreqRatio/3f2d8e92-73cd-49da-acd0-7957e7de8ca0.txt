Audible bruit over right carotid artery system.
The author reports that the patient is being considered for carotid endarterectomy.
Gray scale and color Doppler images demonstrate a large echogenic lesion with posterior shadowing which greatly narrows the lumen of the proximal right internal carotid artery at the level of the carotid bifurcation.
Spectral Doppler images demonstrate increased peak systolic velocity to 315 cm/sec in the region of the lesion with loss of the acoustic window and spectral broadening. The ICA/CCA PSV ratio is 3.79.
Carotid artery stenosis secondary to atherosclerotic disease.
Based on an ICA PSV of 315, degree of stenosis is most likely greater than 70%.
Atherosclerotic carotid artery disease
Carotid vasculitis (very unlikely given the patient's history and the echotextures of the plaques)
Asymptomatic. Patient presents for routine wellness visit. Past medical history significant for diabetes mellitus and dialysis dependent ESRD
The NASCET study showed that there was a clear benifit of carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic patients with proximal internal carotid stenosis of greater than 70%.  However, the ASA study failed to demonstrate more than a trivial benefit of endarterectomy over pharmacutical management in asymptomatic patients.  Carotid endartectomy (as in this case)is overutilized.

Carotid endarterectomy is currently (at the time of this edit) being overtaken by carotid stenting as the favored therapy for carotid lesions, despite the lack of quality data supporting the superiority of stenting.  

Many operators make the case that the superiority of stenting over endarterectomy, like superiority of CTA of the pulmonary arteries over V/Q scanning for the diagnosis of PE, is so obvious that embarking on a prospective randomized blinded trial seems ridiculous. 

Even if the assertion presented above is true, the simplicity of carotid stenting presents an even greater danger of overutilization.  Some daring cardiologists are treating asymptomatic carotid lesions discovered during cardiac catheterizations or during preprocedural assessments. 

Vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists, threatened by this encroachment by cardiologists on what was traditional their "turf," are following suit by treating asymptomatic lesions as well. 

And we self-righteously complain about lawyers.  Good grief.
