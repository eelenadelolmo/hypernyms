Texto: 
Neck pain only.  No neurologic deficit detected.
Unknown
Stage I:  Fracture, usually oblique, through the upper part.  Stable.
Stage II:  Transverse fracture through base of odontoid.  Unstable.
Stage III:  Fracture through base of odontoid extending into body of axis.  Stable.
Type II odontoid process fracture
No differential needed.
78 year old male who fell in his bathroom and hit his chin on the edge of the bathtub.
These show the importance of CT in the setting of C-spine fractures, as the finding is difficult to see on the plain film, but readily apparent on the CT sagittal reformat.
