Hill Sachs Lesion
Anterior dislocation of the humeral head with Hill Sach's lesion.
40 yo female with shoulder pain after trauma.
This patient did not have a history of repetitive trauma but rather a single event.  The Hill Sach's lesion is not well identified on inital films demonstrating dislocation, but was easily identified on post-reduction films.
