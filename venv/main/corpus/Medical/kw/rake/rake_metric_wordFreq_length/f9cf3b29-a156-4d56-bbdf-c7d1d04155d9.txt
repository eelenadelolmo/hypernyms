A 14 year old boy presented with a complaint of right arm and shoulder pain over the last week, as well as right sided chest pain.  

His symptoms had been worsening over the previous 2-3 days, without any resolution of the pain with motrin or naproxen. Of significance, he had been participating in archery recently during gym class, using his right arm to draw back the bow.  

There are no known relieving factors, but his pain is worsened mostly when lying down.  Overall, review of systems was negative for fevers, shortness of breath, cough, congestion, or any other constitutional symptoms.

He does have a past history of rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis.
In this patient, chest pain unresolved with conservative medication led to a chest plain film and the subsequent finding of a large pleural based or chest wall mass in the right hemothorax.  Follow-up CT with contrast revealed a soft tissue mass involving the anterior chest wall, with a moderately large right pleural effusion.  Biopsy of the mass showed a highly cellular undifferentiated round cell neoplasm, with the final diagnosis of Ewing tumor.  The patient was started on initial chemotherapy with Adriamycin along with pain medication while inpatient.
