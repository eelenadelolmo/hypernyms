CT showed a nodular mass-like opacity in the left lower lobe of uncertain etiology.  Interventional radiology was consulted to attempt CT guided biopsy of the lung finding. During CT biopsy she developed a hemopneumothorax and had an emergent chest tube placed. Patient was then transferred to the ICU.  The CT images were examined in correlation with the recent hemorrhage following biopsy. At this time the diagnosis of pulmonary sequestration was considered. She then had a VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) for resection, which confirmed the diagnosis.

This is a 77 y.o. woman who, eighteen months ago, was diagnosed  with natural killer lymphoma (via skin biopsy), and EBV positive. For staging purposes, she had a CT chest with contrast.  Past history of colon cancer diagnosed 33 year ago - status post surgical resection and repair with colostomy.
