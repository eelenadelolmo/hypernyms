Rebound tenderness with palpation of abdomen and associated guarding.

Fever 103 F
WBC 17,000
Patient underwent an uneventful appendectomy.  A Ladd's procedure was not performed given symptoms were believed to be primarily the result of the acute appendicitis and not due to malrotation.
Contrast enhanced axial CT images of the abdomen demonstrates the presence of a "whirlpool sign" - inversion of the superior mesenteric vessels - all of the small bowel loops on the right, left-sided colon, and inflamatory changes within the appendix consistent with phlegmon.
