This 70 year old man had progressive visual loss over 3 to 5 years. He denied headache, nausea or vomiting. Examination  revealed no light perception in either eye. The remainder of his cranial nerves were intact as were his motor and sensory examinations.
This is somewhate unusual, since the adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma is more common in childhood.  The adult squamous and papillary craniopharyngioma is usually a solid mass without calcification.
