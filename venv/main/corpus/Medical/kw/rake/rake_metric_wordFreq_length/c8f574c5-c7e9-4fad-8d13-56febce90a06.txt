Patient was treated for metastatic disease.
Left temporal lobe ring enhancing lesion with associated vasogenic edema.
Brain metastasis
Differential diagnosis for ring enhancing lesion includes:
Primary brain tumor, metastasis, lymphoma, abscess, toxoplasmosis, Granuloma, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, radiation necrosis.
45 year old woman with a history of non-small cell lung cancer.
Because of this patient's history and the fact that there were multiple lesions, a metastatic process is favored over primary tumor.  However, a single lesion may be the only finding in metastatic disease in approximately 30% of cases.  There is vasogenic edema seen which points to a more agressive process like infection or tumor.
