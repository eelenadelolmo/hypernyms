Texto: 
Multiple contrast-enhanced CT images of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate a radial arrangement of loops of fluid-filled small bowel and a convergence of the mesentery and vessels toward a focus within the pelvis, likely representing an adhesion or internal hernia.  Infiltration of the mesentery, ascites, and thickening of the bowel wall suggests vascular compromise.  Note is also made of “small bowel stool” proximal to the point of obstruction.
