Texto: 
Left breast surgically absent. Right breast has linear scar adjacent to the aerola at the upper-outer quadrant of the breast.  Hard, palpable mass subjacent to the scar, mobile.
None. These are benign.
Large, coarse calcification in the upper-outer quadrant of the right breast, subjacent to the patients surgical scar.  No suspicious cluster of microcalcification, mass, or architectual distortion.
Dystrophic breast calcifications
Dystrophic Calcification
Benign Calcification
This 69 year old female is status post excisional right breast biopsy (benign result) and left mastectomy (DCIS) several years ago. She is currently asymptomatic with respect to the breasts and is not taking hormones.
Dystrophic calcifications can be seen as sequelae of trauma to the breast, including surgery.  They typically develop over time, sometimes initially appearing as suspicious microcalcifications at the site of surgery, mimicking cancer recurrence.  If the surgical margins were clear, repeat mammograms over time will show coalesence of these calcifications and development of characteristic benign dystrophism.
