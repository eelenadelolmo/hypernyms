CT of the pelvis and abdomen with contrast: There are heterogenous masses within each kidney.  The mass on the left side measures 3.3 cm in the anteroposterior diameter.  There is a focal round hypodense area in the posterior aspect of this mass which measures 0.5 cm.  In the right kidney, there is a heterogenous mass that measures approximately 1.9 cm in anteroposterior dimension.  

There is no lymphadenopathy.  

The lung bases are clear.

The liver and spleen are normal in size and homogenous in density.  

The pancreas and adrenals are unremarkable.
