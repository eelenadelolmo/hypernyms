Texto: 
Normal external appearance, no swelling or hematoma.  No deformity or asymmetry.  Pain with passive internal rotation and external rotation with flexion of the hip.  Pelvic tilt to the right during gait.
After radiographic diagnosis the patient was referred to an orthopedist for bilateral pinning (metal screws) of slipped capital femoral head epiphyses.   Postoperative follow-up  of these patients is dependent on preoperative severity.  This patient will require close follow-up, with careful evaluation for  development of  avascular necrosis, osteoarthritis, and chondrolysis.
Bilateral posterior displacement of proximal femoral epiphyses in relation to the metaphyses
Bilateral Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis
Trauma, Developmental disorder, Avascular necrosis, Neoplasm, slipped capital femoral epiphysis
14 year-old boy who presented with right hip pain for eight months with increasing intensity and duration.  The patient continued to have pain despite medications. The pain was aggravated by activity.  During the last month the patient developed a limp.
SCFE (Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis) is important for the clinician because early recognition will prevent progressive displacement and greatly impacts long-term outcome.
