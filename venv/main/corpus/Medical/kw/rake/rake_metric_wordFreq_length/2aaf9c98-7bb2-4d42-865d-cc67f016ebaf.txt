Painful, retracted left testicle.
Attempts at manual detorsion were unsuccessful.
The child underwent successful surgical detorsion and orchipexy (surgical fixation of the testis to the scrotal wall with nonabsorbable sutures) to prevent future episodes of torsion.
Figure 1 is a color Doppler ultrasound "buddy shot" image of both testicles which demonstrates blood flow within the parenchyma of the right testicle, but no flow in the parenchyma of the left testicle. 

Figure 2 is a power Doppler ultrasound image of the left testicle, which again demonstrates lack of flow in the left testicle.  
Color Doppler demonstrates direction and velocity of flow with red and blue colortones, but is less sensitive to flow than power doppler. Power Doppler is more sensitive to low-flow states, but simply demonstrates the presence or abscense of flow in one colortone without demonstrating direction or velocity of flow. 
When examining the testes for suspected torsion, it is important to compare right and left testes for relative flow, as flow may still be present but reduced in the torsed testicle, and comparison to the unaffected side will demonstrate relatively lower flow of the affected side. 
Also, as this case demonstrates, flow may be seen immediately adjacent to the torsed testicle, but lack of flow within the parenchyma of the testicle is strongly suggestive of torsion.
