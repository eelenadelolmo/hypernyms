Physical examination reveals no focal neurologic deficit.
The patient passed away four months after the last follow up MR exam (one year after the diagnosis of GBM). He had been receiving a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
A large , heterogeneous T2 hyperintense, ring enhancing mass lesion is noted in the left temporoparietooccipital area. The mass lesion is surrounded by vasogenic edema and exerts significant mass effect in the adjacent cerebral parenchyma and left occipital horn.
The  combination of findings are consistent with a high grade glioma.

49-year old man presents with progressive onset of headache and balance disorder.
We have not used DSC MR Imaging in the last two follow up exams  because there was an obvious significant increase in the size of the enhancing lesion an the surgical margin compared to the exam obtained at three months after the surgical resection and the initiation of the chemoradiotherapy. 
Follow up exam obtained at three months after the surgical resection and the initiation of the chemoradiotherapy revealed an small enhancing lesion which is characterized by a high rCBV of 4.0 ,compared to the normal contralateral white matter, and an interval increase in size compared to the size of the enhancing lesion in the previous exam. 
This enhancing lesion represented  predominantly tumor progression. Small foci of reactive radiation-induced changes cannot be excluded.
If this enhancing lesion represented pseudoprogression , this increased enhancement  would have been stable or decreased on follow-up studies. Conversely,  the enhancing nodule was increasing in size on follow up exams.
Importantly, we should keep in mind that the patient was clinically getting worse and worse.
