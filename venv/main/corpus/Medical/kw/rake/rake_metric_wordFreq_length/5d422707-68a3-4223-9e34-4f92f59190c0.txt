D-Transposition of the Great Vessels
This patient is a 38 year old woman who presented to the ED with constant substernal and epigastric sharp pain with a rating of 8/10. The pain started 5-6 hours prior with no alleviating or aggravating factors. She did not have nausea or vomiting, though she did present with shortness of air and lower extremity edema.

This patient has a past medical history (withheld for now). significant for transposition of the great arteries which was corrected at age 1 year and revised an obstructed venous BAFFLE at age 25.
