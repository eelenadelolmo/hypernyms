Palpable painful mass in left thigh
Specifics unknown in this patient
Increased T2 signal intensity around and within the rectus femoris muscle, most notable at the myotendinous junction.  Increased signal begins at the level of the lesser trochanter and extends distally for 15-20cm.  There is only partial disruption of the myotendinous junction.  No pathology noted in the bone marrow at the lesser tuberosity.
Partial Thickness Tear of the Rectus Femoris Myotendinous Junction
1.	Muscular fiber tear (Rectus Femoris)
2.	Soft Tissue mass
3.	Hematoma
While sprinting the last 100 yards of a 3 mile run, this 30 year-old male developed acute onset of anterior thigh pain.
