Mass was resected
There is a 2.79 x 2.02 x 1.9 cm mass in the right frontal lobe.  It is well circumscribed with heterogeneous signal characteristics.  There is a cystic component medially with calcifications laterally.  There is no mass effect or surrounding edema.  On T2 there is hyperintense  signal surrounding the mass superiorly which probably represents malacic change.
