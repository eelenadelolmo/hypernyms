Non-contributory
None contemplated as this new lesion is asymptomatic.
Lesion in right middle cerebellar peduncle (not evident in five years ago) that is adjacent to a CPA tumor treated by gamma knife.
Lesion is hyper-intense on T2 sequence and has no mass effect and does not enhance.
Radiation Necrosis
• Infarct
• Astrocytoma
• Demyelinating disease
• Radiation effect
70 year old man treated with gamma knife radiosurgery in eight years PTA for right-sided cerebellopontine angle mass suspected to be a vestibular Schwannoma. 

Five years PTA, a followup MRI revealed a small mass and normal signal in right middle cerebellar peduncle.
