Musculoskeletal:
Inspection: No paravertebral muscle rigidity. Increased oily sensation in lower back.
Strength: 5/5 strength bilaterally in Lower Extremeties
Gait: Slow, shifting gait, with short steps due to pain per patient. 

Neurologic:
0/2 patellar reflex bilaterally
2/2 ankle jerk reflex bilaterally
Decreased sensation on lateral aspects of feet bilaterally.
Patient being evaluated for surgical removal of ependymoma.
1. Cystic lesion with internal septation present at the conus medullaris measuring approximately 3.6 CM in longitudinal dimension and .9 cm in AP dimension. Syringomyelia noted at the visualized portion of thoracic spinal cord. This could represent possible ependymoma versus other neoplasm. 
2. T12-L1 level: Minimal diffuse disc budge of the annulus fibrosus which minimally impinges upon anterior subarachnoid space. 
3. L4-5 level: There is a broad-based central disc hernation of the protrusion type measuring 2 mm in AP dimension which impinges upon the anterior surface of the thecal sac.
4. Partial sacralization of L5 vertebra suspected.
Spinal Cord Ependymoma pending histology results.
1. Spinal Cord ependymoma vs other neoplasm.
2. Central disc herniation L4-L5 level.
34 year old woman present after a work related injury on January 31st. Patient was taking out trash at job when she slipped on ice and landed on her lower back, where she felt immediate pain and became incontinent at the time. She went to the hospital and was discharged after x-rays, which were normal. Presently she describe and burning sensation in the mid-lower back. It is made worse by mechanical movements and ranges from 9/10 to 10/10. The pain radiates down her right thigh to her knee. She report bowel and bladder incontinence. Patient also report numbness in her right thigh.

What is it?
Spinal cord ependymomas: Subclass of tumors called gliomas that typically arise in the spinal cord. They are the most common intramedullary spinal cord tumor, comprising 60-80 percent of spinal gliomas [1]. 

Mechanism of injury:
The tumor will exhibit a mass effect which will disrupt the local nerve fibers. Neurological dysfunction occurs distal to the lesion, including sensory dysesthesias and muscular weakness especially of the iliopsoas musculature. Sphincters loss may occur causing the patient to become incontinent. Patient also report difficulty ambulating. The most frequent symptom is nocturnal awakening due to a gnawing unremitting pain, which may indicate the localize of the tumor [2]

Demographics:
Most common intramedullary tumor in adults, with peak age of presentation 30 to 40 years [3].

Radiology:
MRI of the spine is currently the diagnostic study of choice. Half of ependymomas occur in the lumbosacral spinal cord, whereas the other can occur anywhere in the cervical or thoracic spinal cord [4]. On T1 weighted image, 70% are typically isointense, 26% hypointense, 3% slightly hyperintense. Ependymomas are usually all hyperintense on T2 weighted MR images, and all enhance with injection of Gallidium-DTPA [5]

Prognosis & Treatment:
Management of the tumor is typically a total gross resection of the tumor. Prognosis typically depended on the ability to perform a complete resection of the tumor. There was no role for radiation therapy in ependymomas. Progression free survival at 5, 10, and 15 years 74, 60, and 35% and was significantly influenced by treatment type and age of patient. Overall survival at 15 years was 75% with complete resection and age being the major determinants [6]. Extraneural metastases are uncommon [7]. Another study found that of 26 patients with tumor resection between 1958 to 1995, 15/26 had improvement in symptoms, 7/26 were unchanged, and 6/26 hand worsening of symptoms [8]
