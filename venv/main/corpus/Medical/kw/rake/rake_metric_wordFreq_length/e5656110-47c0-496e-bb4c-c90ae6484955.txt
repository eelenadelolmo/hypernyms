Physical exam revealed moderate tenderness to palpation over the right medial mid-thigh, and a 2-3 cm deep, firm, non-mobile mass palpable in the same region.  The patient demonstrated full range of motion of his right lower extremity, however, pain was exacerbated by forced extension of the right knee.
Treatment usually follows one of three methods: surgical, medical, and percutaneous.  Traditional surgical treatment has a limited success rate of 60% due to complications  identifying lesions intraoperatively, leading to incomplete removal and possible recurrence.   Medical management relies on NSAIDs while awaiting spontaneous regression under observation.  The time to regression is unpredictable.   CT-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation has become the treatment of choice for most osteoid osteomas located in the appendicular skeleton and pelvis, and a success rate of 91% has been demonstrated.   After needle biopsy, the radiofrequency electrode is introduced under CT guidance and the tip is heated to 90?C and maintained for 3-6 minutes.  This technique is limited because the electrode must be positioned at least 1 cm away from major nerves.  Therefore, lesions in some locations such as the hand or vertebral column make poor candidates.
AP and lateral (lateral not shown) radiographs of the right femur demonstrated a zone of cortical thickening with a smooth contour along the medial aspect of the distal right femoral metadiaphysis (Fig 1).  A central lucency measuring 2.5 cm craniocaudal can be seen with a small component of associated cortical penetration.  No surrounding soft tissue abnormalities were evident.  

MR T1 coronal image (Fig. 2) demonstrates the wide cortical thickening with associated cortical penetration. 

Follow-up MR imaging validated the cortical thickening as low signal intensity. On T2-weighted images a nidus in the mid femoral shaft was noted with high signal intensity and enhancement following administration of intravenous gadolinium (Figs. 3&4). There is marked bone production medially, with adjacent bone marrow edema involving the mid femoral shaft.

Nuclear medicine bone scan (Fig. 5)reveals intense focal uptake eccentrically in the right distal third of the femur.

29-year-old man with 3 year history of gradually worsening right medial thigh pain, eventually requiring the use of crutches for ambulation.  Pain was worse at night, but never woke him from sleep.  NSAIDs provided temporary relief of symptoms.
