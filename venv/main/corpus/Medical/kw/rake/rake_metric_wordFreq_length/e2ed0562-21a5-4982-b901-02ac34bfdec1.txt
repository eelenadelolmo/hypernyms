CXR: Smooth, convex soft tissue density at right cardiophrenic border.

CT:  Smooth, convex cyst (fluid attenuation HU=10) at right cardiophrenic border.
Pericardial cyst
From CXR findings:  Differential diagnosis includes:

1)Pericardial cyst
2)Epicardial fat pad
3)Morgagni hernia
4)Lymphadenopathy or pericardial tumor
21 y/o asymptomatic male for flight PE>
CT findings for pericardial cysts include:  a smooth, sharply marginated, fluid attenuation cyst which typically contacts the anterior chest wall, diaphragm, and heart. It is encapsulated by a very thin wall which may be difficult to see on CT. Higher internal cyst attenuation can be seen secondary to prior hemorrhage or infection.  Difficult or uncertain cases can be further evaluated by MRI.
