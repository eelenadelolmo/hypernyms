Vitals are within normal limits (afebrile)
Abdomen was mildly distended. Moderate discomfort noted in LLQ upon palpation. No peritoneal signs.
Rest of exam is benign
Hernia was reduced, a small portion of large bowel was resected, colostomy was placed, diaphragm was repaired, J-tube was placed, 3 chest tubes were placed, IVC filter placed, antibiotics started per ID recommendations.
AAS-1.  Only noted for "single dilated loop of colon under an elevated left hemi-diaphragm." Patient sent home from the ER. 
CT-1. Patient received CT the next day. Similar findings noted (no acute pathology). Patient sent home again
AAS-2A. Caliber change is noted in gas just distal to the splenic flexure concerning for obstruction. Patient admitted.
AAS-2B (w/ Barium): Taken on day of admit (3rd day). A tortuous narrowing was observed w/ intermittent passage of contrast past splenic flexure. Also concerning for obstruction (partial)
EGD-1 &
EGD-2: show extrinsic compression, likely from the diaphragm.  
EGD-3: Dusky, friable mucosa seen c/w ischemic colitis

55 y/o male with h/o metastatic esophageal cancer (IIb). Pt is s/p transhiatal esophagectomy three years ago. He recently finished a round of chemotherapy. A PET 3 months ago demonstrated increase uptake in liver, L hip, and vague uptake in descending colon.
 The patient presents to ED w/ 1 day h/o “crampy” LLQ abd pain w/ nausea but no emesis. Complaints of constipation and not passing flatus. He also notes multiple episodes of “dry heaves”. He describes pain as coming in waves and acknowledges a decreased appetite. Denies melena, hematochezia, fever
Ischemic Colitis can present secondary to several etiologies. This patient had a very unique cause of extrinsic compression on his colon which resulted in ischemia. His large intestine (arount the splenic flexure) herniated through his trans-hiatal esophagectomy site.
