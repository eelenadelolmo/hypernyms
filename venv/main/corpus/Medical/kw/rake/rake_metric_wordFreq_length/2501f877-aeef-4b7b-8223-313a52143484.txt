Texto: 
Palpable, firm, nontender masses are associated with the left third metacarpal bone, left third finger proximal and middle phalanges and left fourth finger middle phalanx.
Surgical investigation/biopsy is warranted in the setting of pain without fracture to rule out malignant transformation into a chondrosarcoma.

In the absence of pain or other clinical findings to suggest malignant degeneration, no specific treatment is indicated other than patient education regarding the 5-30 percent risk of malignant degeneration associated with Ollier's Disease.

Large osseous defects can be treated with curettage and filled with bone graft.
Plain radiographs of the left hand demonstrate a central expansile, lytic/cystic lesion involving the distal half of the shaft of the left third metacarpal bone.  Mild endosteal scalloping is present.  Additionally, there are some subtle cortical irregularities at the junction of the normal bone and affected bone without obvious periostitis, possibly related to prior surgery.  There is no evidence of a calcified chondroid matrix or of soft-tissue hemangiomas.  A similar process involves almost the entire shafts of the left third finger proximal and middle phalanges and the distal shaft of the left fourth finger middle phalanx. 

Nuclear medicine scintigraphy demonstrates focally increased soft tissue and osseous activity corresponding to the plain radiographic abnormalities of the left hand (left third metacarpal bone, left third finger proximal and middle phalanges and left fourth finger middle phalanx).  There is normal nonfocal distribution of activity throughout the remainder of the osseous and soft tissue structures.
Ollier's Disease (enchondromatosis)
Multiple enchondromas (Ollier's Disease)
Fifteen-year-old male with history of left third metacarpal enchondroma status post bone graft approximately nine years ago presents with multiple palpable masses of the left hand.
None.
