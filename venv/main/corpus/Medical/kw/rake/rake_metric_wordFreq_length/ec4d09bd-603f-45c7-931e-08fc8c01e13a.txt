The management of aortitis depends on the underlying cause. The initial treatment of infectious aortitis is intravenous antibiotics with broad antimicrobial coverage of the most likely pathological organisms, particularly Staphylococcal species and Gram-negative rods. Surgical interventions may be necessary.  Immunosuppressive therapy such as oral glucocorticoid therapy is the primary treatment for inflammatory aortitis. All patients with Takayasu arteritis or GCA with known aortic involvement should undergo periodic imaging for the development of complications such as aortic aneurysm. Angioplasty or bypass grafts or stents may be necessary once arterial stenosis has occurred.
Throughout the lower thoracic descending aorta and abdominal aorta, there is marked circumferential soft tissue density. This does not appear to represent intramural hematoma, atherosclerotic plaque, or thrombus, but rather thickening and enhancement of the aortic wall. The celiac, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric, and bilateral renal arteries are patent and without significant stenosis. There is no compression of the major abdominal aorta branch vessels by the circumferential soft tissue, and the soft tissue does not appear to extend on to the branch vessels.
