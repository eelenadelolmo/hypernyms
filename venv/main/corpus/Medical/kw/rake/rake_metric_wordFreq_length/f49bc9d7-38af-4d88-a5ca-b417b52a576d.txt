There is a well circumcribed mass with a central scar in the lateral segment of the left lobe of the liver.  The lesion is isodense to liver on non-contrast images, with intense early arterial enhancement, rapidly washing out on delayed images.  The lesion displays corresponding activity ( no photopenic defect)on the Tc-99m sulfur colloid scan.
