Neck pain with movement.
Surgical resection.
Sagittal T1 and T2 weighted MRI images of the cervical spine reveal a normal appearance of the cervical cord as well as intact vertebral bodies and disks.  At the superior aspect of the images, however, there is an approximately 4cm extraaxial mass located anterior to the pons.  The mass is relatively isointense to gray matter on both T1 and T2 weighted images.

Axial T2 MRI image of the brain at the level of the brainstem/posterior fossa shows an extraaxial, mass lesion located anterior to the pons.  Mild to moderate mass effect is present at the pons, which is posteriorly and laterally displaced.  No significant edema surrounds the mass.  The mass is relatively isointense to gray matter on the T2 weighted images, and the hint of a dural “tail” is seen at the left anterolateral margin of the mass.
Meningioma (path proven)
Meningioma
Lymphoma
Metastatic disease
The patient is a 64 year-old white woman with neck pain who underwent a non-emergent MRI study of her cervical spine following a motor vehicle collision.
This case of an incidentally discovered meningioma on MRI evaluation of the cervical spine performed for unrelated reasons (remote trauma with persistent neck pain) illustrates the importance of carefully reviewing the entirety of a given image, irrespective of the given clinical history.  Meningiomas are the most common extraaxial tumor, comprising approximately 15-18% of intracranial tumors in adults.  Meningiomas account for 33% of all incidental intracranial tumors.  MRI exam reveals a hypo to isointense mass on T1WI, an iso to hyperintense mass on T2WI, and post-gadolinium images typically show homogeneous diffuse enhancement (1).
