Pectus excavatum can mimic RML disease and result in inappropriate use of antibiotics if lateral views or prior films are not available. 

It is a cosmetic deformity that rarely has cardiopulmonary consequences, but can have severe psychosocial consequences.  Treatment options are open surgical repair (Ravitch technique), or a minimally invasive Nuss procedure.  The Nuss procedure involves insertion of a preformed Nuss bar  that internally pushes the chest wall into a normal configuration, and is left in place for 2 years.
