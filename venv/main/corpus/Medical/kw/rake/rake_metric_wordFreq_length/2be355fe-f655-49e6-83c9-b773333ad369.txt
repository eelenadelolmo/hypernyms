CT - There is a large heterogeneous and partially enhancing mass within the left chest. It compresses the main and left pulmonary arteries as well as left main bronchus. It also has mass effect on the left ventricle although no definite pericardium invasion is identified. 

MR - 12.5 X 12.1 X 16.5cm mass within the left hemithorax with extension through the chest wall and under the left pectoralis muscle. There is a tissue plane between the mass and the aorta. Mass effect on left main bronchus and pulmonary artery. Lesion is heterogeneous in signal on both T1 and T2 sequences and demonstrates heterogenous enhancement on the post-contrast images.
