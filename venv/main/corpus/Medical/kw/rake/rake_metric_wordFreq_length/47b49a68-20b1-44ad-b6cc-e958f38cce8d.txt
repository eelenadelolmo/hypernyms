There are innumerable flask-shaped outpouchings in longitudinal rows parallel to the long axis of the esophagus.  Although these structures could be mistaken for areas of ulceration, note how they often do not appear to communicate with  the esophageal lumen, whereas actual ulcers almost always are contiguous with the lumen (Film .1Z).  Also note the presence of a focal stricture in the upper thoracic esophagus.
Esophageal intramural pseudodiverticulosis.
Dysphagia (Film .1).
Esophageal intramural pseudodiverticula are dilated excretory ducts of deep mucous glands in the esophagus.  These patients classically present with dysphagia due to associated strictures in the mid or upper thoracic esophagus.  The pseudodiverticula are usually located above and below the stricture.  This condition is often associated with Candida esophagitis, but the Candida organism probably represents a secondary invader due to stasis associated with the pseudodiverticula.  These structures are also detected with increased frequency in diabetics and alcoholics.  Treatment is generally directed toward the underlying stricture, if one is present, because the pseudodiverticula themselves rarely cause problems.

Although diffuse esophageal intramural pseudodiverticulosis may produce a spectacular radiographic appearance (Film .1), recent evidence suggests that the majority of patients with this condition have isolated involvement of the distal esophagus with multiple pseudodiverticula in the region of a peptic stricture (Film .2).  When pseudodiverticula are identified in patients with scarring from reflux esophagitis, it is important to distinguish these structures radiographically from actual areas of ulceration.  As indicated above, one clue is that the pseudodiverticula often do not appear to communicate with the esophageal lumen (Films .1 and .2).
