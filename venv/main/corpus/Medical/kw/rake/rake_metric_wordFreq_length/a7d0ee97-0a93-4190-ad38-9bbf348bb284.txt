• Comatose. Responds to deep pain only
• Tachycardia to 150 bpm
• Hypertensive with systolic at 150 mmHg
• Acidotic
Supportive.
Diffuse cerebral edema with widespread infarcts of the basal ganglia, cerebellum and cerebral cortex.
Anoxic Brain Injury, anoxia
• Drowning
• Asphyxiation
• Cardiac Arrest
40 year old alcoholic man recovering from knee surgery.  Found unconscious by care giver who called EMS. The patient was not breathing when EMS arrived likely due to CNS depression by drugs and alcohol.
In this case, the exact circumstances that led to the global anoxia are not clear.  It is possible that this patient had either a cardiac or a respiratory arrest; or, perhaps suffered from a  prolonged hypoventilation episode - not witnessed, because he lived alone.
