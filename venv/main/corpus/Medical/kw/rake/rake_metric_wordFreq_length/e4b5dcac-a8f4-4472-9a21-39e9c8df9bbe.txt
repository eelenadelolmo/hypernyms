There is expansile widening of L3 vertebral body with mild central compression fracture.  There is coarsened trabecular markings of L2. L5 demonstrates an ivory appearance.  There is spondylosis at multiple
levels.  Noted is disc calcification at T11-T12 and T12-L1.  Also noted is vacuum disc phenomenon at L5-S1.
Paget Disease of Bone
Osteosclerotic metastases, Hodgkin disease, vertebral hemangioma
70 yo wm with Pagets disease of spine by bone scan 2002.  Reports back pain, height loss. Please eval with spine series to assist in management.
Paget's disease of the spine may be monostotic or polyostotic.  The classic "picture frame" appearance is due to the thickened cortex.  The coarsening of the vetebral trabeuclae leads to the increased density appearance, the so called "ivory vetebra".  However, Paget's disease also weakens the bone which leads to biconcave vetebrae with secondary degeneration as illustrated in this case.  Another example of weakened cortical bones caused by Paget's is acetabulae protrusio. The juvenile form of Paget's called familial idiopathic hyperphosphatasia demonstrates similar findings with sparing of the epiphysis.
