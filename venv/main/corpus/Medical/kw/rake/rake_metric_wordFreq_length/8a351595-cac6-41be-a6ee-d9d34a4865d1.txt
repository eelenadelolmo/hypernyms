PE: Tenderness to palpation of right upper arm. Active elbow flexion and extension limited by pain in upper arm.           Laboratory data: Anemia, hypercalcemia, azotemia, SPEP M spike, peripheral blood smear shows rouleux formation, BM aspirate with plasmacytosis (60%).
Treatment usually consists of chemotherapy with alkylating agents and induces remission in 50 to 70 percent of patients.  However, median survival is 3 years. Those with multiple lesions rarely survive longer than a year.  New therapies include peripheral stem cell transplants in combination with the traditional chemotherapy regimen. This combined therapy has induced remission in 50 percent of patients.  Complications such as recurrent infections, pathologic fractures, and renal failure are common.
Lateral radiograph of the humerus shows extensive lytic lesions of the medullary canal with endosteal scalloping  consistent with multiple myeloma.                                                        Lateral radiograph of the skull shows small lytic lesions in the frontal region consistent with multiple myeloma.
