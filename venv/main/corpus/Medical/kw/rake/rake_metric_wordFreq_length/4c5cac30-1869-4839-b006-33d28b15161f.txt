The physical examination shows a nondistended abdomen and nonspecific lower abdominal pain and was otherwise noncontributory.  Abdominal radiography and CT of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained.
The primary treatment of schistosomiasis is the use of drug therapy, namely praziquantel, oxamniquine, and metrifonate.  Early treatment can lead to rapid clinical improvement.  Extensive fibrosis is associated with irreversible disease.  Bleeding esophageal varices can be managed by sclerotherapy or surgery.  As of yet, there remains no vaccination for this disease; however, research is currently being conducted towards producing a safe and effective protective vaccine as a long-term solution to this significant health problem.
Abdominal radiography showed subtle curvilinear densities overlying in the left lower quadrant and central within the pelvis.  This was confirmed on intravenous contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT to be the caused by thin mucosal surface calcifications within the descending and sigmoid colons.  Incidental note is made of thin right hepatic lobe capsule calcifications.
Schistosomiasis Japonicum
• Schistosomiasis Japonicum
• Tuberculosis (TB)
• Alkaline encrustation cystitis
• Primary amyloidosis
• Radiation
A 51-year-old woman presents with chronic left flank and pelvic pain.  Her past medical history is remarkable for a remote liver biopsy.  She reports prior travel to several Asian countries.  Surgical history is notable for a prior cesarean section.
Bladder calcifciation was not present on remainder of pelvis CT (images not included).  These colonic and hepatic calcifications are characteristic of Schistosomiasis infection of the gastrointestinal tract.  Liver biopsy confirmed Schistosomiasis japonicum infection.

Imaging is useful for showing the extent of involvement and identifying complications of disease.  Definitive diagnosis is achieved with serologic testing or tissue biopsy.  Drug therapy is the primary form of treatment and can lead to rapid clinical improvement.
