â€¢	?SKIN- no bruises, no rash, no jaundice
â€¢	?Treatment is symptomatic
â€¢	?Patients should be managed by multiple specialties including endocrine, neurology, ophthalmology, and PCP with frequent follow up. 
â€¢	?Early diagnosis associated with better outcomes: untreated hormonal abnormalities place an additional neurodevelopmental burden on a child already compromised by visual impairment, and also place the patient at risk of hypoglycemia, adrenal crises, and consequently death.
â€¢	?Children can also improve with developmental programs for the visually impaired, as well as PT/OT
â€¢	?Prognosis is variable, depending on the severity hormonal deficiency, visual deficit, and abnormal anatomy.
â€¢	Absence of the septum pelucidum.
â€¢	Marked hypoplasia of the optic chiasm and optic nerves 
â€¢	Pituitary gland is normal in size for age. 
â€¢	No identifieble posterior bright spot.

â€¢	Remainder of the orbits is normal in thickness and contour.
â€¢	Myelination and development are unremarkable. 
â€¢	No migrational abnormality or other cortical structural change.

28-month-old term male with a past medical history of unknown liver disease, delayed motor and verbal skills born via SVD to an 18Â yoÂ G2P1011 who presented following episode of seizure like activity. The seizure activity first occurred one day prior to admission. Mother responded to child crying in crib to find him with a blank stare and eyes were glossed over. His arms and legs were jerking. This jerking motion lasted for about 10 minutes. No cyanosis noted during this episode; patient appeared to keep breathing. Patient wears a diaper, which was wet, but it was unclear if incontinenceÂ occured with the episode. Immediately following the jerking motion, the patient fell asleep and one hour later woke up and appeared to be back to baseline per mother. The patient awoke again later in the night crying and a second episode, similar to the first, occurred and lasted about 2 min. 

He was taken to the ED and his glucose was noted to be 30. He was given one amp ofÂ D50. No further seizure activity was noted once the patient reached the hospital. Mother noted that the hisÂ p.o. intake had decreased the day prior, but that he has always been a picky eater. She stated that he hadÂ rhinorrhea three days prior to admission and a cough that started one day prior to admission. Also, a subjective fever was noted during this time period. Patient has never suffered from seizures in the past.
