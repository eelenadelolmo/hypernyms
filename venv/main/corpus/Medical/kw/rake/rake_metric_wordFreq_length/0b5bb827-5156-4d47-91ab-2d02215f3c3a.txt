PICC line placed for Imipenem 500mg IV q6h and serial scans to follow abcess resolution.
Opacity in RLL field. Well circumscribed, thick walled with a with an air fluid level that has organized in comparison with previous frontal CXR one month prior.  On CT the opacity appears to have an air passageway that extends into the abnormality.  On fluroscopy a guide wire can be seen in the abnormality and in another fluro image a pigtail catheter can be seen in the lesion.
Infectious cavitary abcess
DDx for cavitary mass in lung fields includes:
-Malignancy- either primary, secondary,
-Granulomatous dz- infx or non-infx and can be active or inactive, this includes vasculitis such as Wegener's granulomatosis
-Infection(non-granulomatous) such as PNA and abcess, including septic emboli, especially if multiple 
-Congenital abnormality
Patient seen for shortness of breath at rest at the begining of December.  In the work up a right lower lobe mass was discovered.  Patient has a history of breast cancer and colon cancer 3 and 5 years ago respectively.  Bronchoscopy was performed and the BAL showed cells suspicious for malignancy but a biopsy was negative.  Patient was discharged  on antibiotic therapy that was soon modified to include multiple antibiotic medications none of which provided improvement. She was referred for repeat bronchoscopy and lung biopsy to exclude carcinoma.  Multiple anaerobes were cultured from the cavity fluid. The biopsy was negative for malignant cells.  An endobronchial drain was placed to facilitate healing.
All three bacteria showed sensitivity to Imipenem.  There was some discussion about the possibility of direct infusion of abx into the abcess though the pigtail catheter but in a recent paper ( Herth et al. Chest 2005) patients did just as well with systemic abx and leaving the pigtail for drainage purposes.
Placement of a catheter for lung abscess treatment is not common.  In this case the drain was placed because the patient had shown no improvement despite aggressive antibiotic therapy, and because the abscess was easily accessible through the tracts created by earlier biopsies.
