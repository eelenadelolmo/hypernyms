No aphasia
Supportive.  Neurologic symptoms cleared with no residual deficit.
CTA reveals right ICA diminshed in caliber compared to the left both in the neck and intracranial protion.
No evidence of atherosclerotic plaque or findings of dissection.

secondary to meningioma Tx with gamma knife therapy
• Spasm
• Congenital hypoplasia
• Dissection
• Fibromuscular dysplasia
53 year old woman presents to the ER with acute onset
