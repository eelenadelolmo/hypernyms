Admission vitals included BP 165/105 and GCS=4. No evidence of external trauma.  Pupils reactive to light but w/ slow response.  Breath sounds clear bilat; normal S1 & S2, no m/r/g; abdomen s/nd/nt; radial pulses 2+ bilat; GCS-4 (verbal-1, eyes-1, motor-2)Na-145, K-4.0, Cl-106, CO2-30, BUN-28, Creat-0.8, GLU-109WBC-13.4, Hgb-14.1, Hct-43.1, Plt-383Alk phos-92, AST-32, ALT 35, TBili-0.9
Patient had been admitted to another hospital one week prior and was diagnosed with acute occipital lobe hemorrhage.  Right occipital blood collection noted on CT was unchanged from the previous admission.  

Evaluation for acute change of mental status revealed a urinary tract infection.  After antibiotic treatment for UTI, patient’s GCS improved to 10-12 (pt unable to speak x 3 years).

Hospice care was arranged for the patient.
Parenchymal hematoma, right occipital lobe
Small amount of ventricular blood
Intracerebral hemorrhage (likely related to chronic hypertension)
Vascular malformation
Hypertensive hemorrhage
Amyloid angiopathy
Metastatic disease (e.g. renal, lung etc.)
Occult trauma
89 y/o with past medical history significant for dementia and hypertension, noted to have altered mental status at home.
This patient presented with altered mental status prompting an evaluation for intracranial bleed.  Her long history of hypertension is likely the main factor leading to the intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) noted.
