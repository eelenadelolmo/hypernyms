Texto: 
The patient was managed conservatively and followed with serial chest radiographs.
Chest AP and Lateral radiograph show a left sided hydropneumothorax.  Additionally, a left sided pulmonary nodule is noted toward the apex of the lung and metallic objects consistent with recent surgery overlying the mediastinum.

Compare this case with the following case showing a meniscus:

Hydropneumothorax
•	Iatrogenic
•	Trauma
•	Esophogeal Rupture (Boerhave Disease)
•	Fistula (i.e. colopleural, bronchopleural)
•	Infection (parasites and TB)
•	Tumor (primary or metastatic)
•	Spontaneous
•	Pseudo-hydropneumothorax  (i.e. Hiatal hernia)
The patient is post operative day 15 from a coronary artery bypass operation.  He was discharged from inpatient care 3 days ago.  The patient is currently asymptomatic.
The presence of a post coronary artery bypass surgery pleural effusion is estimated to be between 40-90%.  Pleural effusions may be more common in a patients with internal mammary artery harvesting versus a saphenous vein graft.  Resolution of the pulmonary effusion is expected on average in 8 weeks.  Roughly 30% of patients of post coronary artery bypass patients, in one series, developed a pneumothorax.  Management is nearly always conservative in these patients, unless their pulmonary status is compromised, or a fever is present.  Tube thoracostomy is the standard treatment when indicated.
