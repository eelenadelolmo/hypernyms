Texto: 
PE:  Chest: CTA bilaterally
Labs:  elevated D-dimer (1.6), O2 sat=93% on RA
-Anticoagulation therapy
-if patient were unstable: more aggressive therapy such as thrombolysis could be performed
CT (PE/DVT):  Large right main pulmonary artery intraluminal hypodense filling defect.  Additional filling defects in right lung lobar branches.
Pulmonary embolism
1) Pulmonary embolism
63 y/o female with 2 days of SOB.
A negative D-dimer has a good negative predictive value.  However, a positive D-dimer is nonspecific and must be interpreted in the conjunction with clinical picture.
