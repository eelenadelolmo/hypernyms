Appears mildly obese.  Height 146.5cm, mass of 53.2kg.  Pulse 97bpm, blood pressure 93/53, temperature 36.4 degrees Celsius.  No focal neurological deficits.   Water deprivation test did not meet full criteria for central diabetes insipidus, but was considered a "partial central diabetes insipidus".
Sublabial and transphenoidal resection.  Follow up consisted of MRI monitoring every 6 months for 2 years after the surgery, and then yearly after that.
MRI: The sella turcica is expanded and there is a mass seen within the sella turcica measuring approximately 1 centimeter in diameter.  The anterior pituitary is displaced and compressed anteriorly.  There is a rim of bright signal on the pre-contrast study that may represent the compressed neural hypophysis.  The pituitary stalk is slightly thickened inferiorly and shows bright enhancement.  The mass is bright on T1 and shows no significant enhancement with injection. It is also bright on FLAIR and T2 weighted images.
