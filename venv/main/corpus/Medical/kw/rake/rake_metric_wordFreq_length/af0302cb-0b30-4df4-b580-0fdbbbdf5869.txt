57 y.o. woman admitted for two weeks history of abdominal pain and eight dark, loose stools per day. Patient has an eight-year history of ulcerative colitis. Patient was initially managed medically for an ulcerative colitis exacerbation. Initial acute abdominal series obtained on hospital day 2 (Films 1-3). The second acute abdominal series (Films 4-6) was obtained following greatly increased abdominal pain, fever, and abdominal distention.
Toxic megacolon is a well-known complication of chronic ulcerative colitis, but it can also present in association with Crohn&#34;s disease, psuedomembranous colitis, amebic colitis, and other infectious causes. Marked dilation of the colon is obvious in these patients. The wall of the colon becomes extremely thin, friable, and susceptible to spontaneous perforation. Distention is usually best noted in the transverse colon of a supine patient. Toxic megacolon is defined as distention of the colon (>5.5cm). Pseudopolypoid projections are frequently noted. Spontaneous perforation of the colon is the major complication. Because of the risk of perforation barium enema is absolutely contraindicated. 

This patient was also found to have C. difficile toxin in her stool. Positive C. difficile toxin the stool with associated acute abdominal symptoms is diagnostic for psuedomembranous colitis.  The combination of chronic ulcerative colitis and psuedomembranous colitis raises interesting questions as to the true etiology of her development of toxic megacolon.

This patient was managed surgically with colectomy.
