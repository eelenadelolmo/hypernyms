MRI shows an extra axial lobulated mass located at the floor of the anterior cranial fossa bilaterally, and lateral to the right frontal lobe, with T1 intermediate signal and T2 low signal.  It enhances with some internal heterogeneity.  Associated reactive edema.  CXR by report was normal.
Neurosarcoid
Neurosarcoid.
Meningitis (particularly TB or fungal).
Epidural infection (extension from adjacent sinus disease.)
Meningioma.
Metastatic disease.
49 yo man, history of sarcoidosis, with seizures.
About 5% of patients with sarcoid have clinical CNS involvement.  27% have CNS involvement at autopsy.  >90% of neurosarcoid cases will have involvement of the lungs.  Most CNS cases present with cranial nerve deficits, most often facial nerve (CN VII) palsy.  Clinical and imaging findings are often disparate.  Clinical course is usually a self limted monophasic illness.  Most respond to steroids.  Imaging resolution lags clinical symptom resolution.

In this case, MRI shows isointense dural-based lesions on T1, that are hypointense on T2, with variable enhancement.
