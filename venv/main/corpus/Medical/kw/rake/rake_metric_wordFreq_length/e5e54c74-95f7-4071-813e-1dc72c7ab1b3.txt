On physical exam the patient had a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 12 with signs of penetrating injury to his neck.
CT angiogram of the head and neck vessels was obtained (fig. 1).  The next day, the patient’s neurological status deteriorated and a non-contrast head CT was obtained (fig. 2).
Contrast enhanced CT angiogram of the head was performed which demonstrated a radiopaque foreign body in the expected location of the basilar artery with satisfactory collateral filling of the posterior cerebral arteries (Fig. 1).   A subsequent non-contrast CT of the head was performed following onset of further neurological symptoms, which revealed interval displacement of the radiopaque foreign body to the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) with loss of gray white matter differentiation consistent with left PCA territorial infarction from embolized IED fragment (Fig. 2).
