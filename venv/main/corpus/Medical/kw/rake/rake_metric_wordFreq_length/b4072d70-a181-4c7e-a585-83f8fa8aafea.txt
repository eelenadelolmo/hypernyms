Lhermitte-Duclos
WHO Grade I 
Cell of Origin: Cerebellar neurons (hamartomatous?) 
Synonyms: Ganglioneuroma, Purkinjioma, Granular cell hypertrophy of the cerebellum, Gangliocytoma dysplasticum, 
Hamartoma of the cerebellum 
Common Locations: Cerebellar hemispheres 
Demographics: Early adulthood 
Clinical Presentation: Hydrocephalus; may also be found as an incidental lesion 
Histology: Derangement of normal laminar cellular organization of cerebellum: 1) Thickening of outer molecular cell 
layer, 2) Loss of middle Purkinje cell layer, 3) Infiltration of inner granular cell layer with dysplastic ganglion cells 
Special Stains: Synaptophysin positive 
Progression: Good prognosis with surgical excision. Recurrence rare. 
Radiology: Non-enhancing cerebellar hemisphere mass with characteristic striated MR appearance. Occasionally 
contains calcifications. 
Comments: Associated with Cowden's disease (autosomal dominant, mucosal neuromas and breast cancer
