Had subsequent contrast MR for further evaluation that did not further help with characterization secondary to image degradation from motion artifact, however there was no gross enhancement.
Extradural, intracanalicular lobular mass which follows CSF signal.  Widening of canal and right sided neuroforamina with some displacement of the thecal sac.
Extradural arachnoid cyst versus focal dural ectasia
arachnoid cyst
focal dural ectasia
Patient with right CV angle tenderness and history of multiple UTI's was noted to have scalloping of vertebral bodies on a stone-protocol CT of the abdomen.  These were incompletely visualized and an MR was subsequently ordered.
The lesion, although causing some displacement of the thecal sac and scalloping of the vertebral bodies, has no aggressive features.  It also, follows CSF signal and was found incidentally.
