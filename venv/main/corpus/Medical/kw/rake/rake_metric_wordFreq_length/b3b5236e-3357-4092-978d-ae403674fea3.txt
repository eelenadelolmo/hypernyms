swollen right scrotum without evidence of focal mass
Antibiotics against the offending organism
Submitted images reveal an enlarged, hypervascular, slightly hypoechoic right epididymis when compared to the left side.  This area corresponded to the area of maximal pain during physical exam and during ultrasound examination.  Both testicles demonstrate homogeneous echotexture without mass lesion and normal, symmetric blood flow.  Free fluid is seen surrounding the right epididymis and testicle.
Epididymitis
testicular torsion
torsion of a testicular appendage
orchitis
epididymitis
incarcerated hernia
infarcted germ-cell tumor
scrotal cellulitis/fascitis
post-traumatic causes
37 y/o WM complains of 10 day history of pain and swelling involving primarily right scrotum/testicle.
Hyperemia generally precedes grey-scale changes so color Doppler is more sensitive to epididymitis than grey-scale sonography.
