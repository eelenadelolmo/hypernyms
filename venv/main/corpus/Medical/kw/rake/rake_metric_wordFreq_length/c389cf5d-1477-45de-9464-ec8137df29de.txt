PA/LAT CXR:  middle mediastinal mass
CT: homogeneously attenuating mass with mass effect on trachea and esophagus
MR: mixed intensity mass
Bronchogenic cyst, Congenital
Middle mediastinal masses, more specifically foregut duplication cysts
1.  bronchogenic cyst
2.  esophageal duplication cyst
3.  neurenteric cyst
