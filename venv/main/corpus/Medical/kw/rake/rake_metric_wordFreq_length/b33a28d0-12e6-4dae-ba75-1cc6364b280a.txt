Texto: 
Physical exam revealed an unstable humeral head in the glenoid labrum with passive range of motion.  Moreover, a popping sensation was appreciated by the examiner.
Information not available
Radiography was unremarkable, showing no evidence of prior traumatic osseous injury.

MR Arthrography revealed avulsion and displacement of the anteroinferior labrum medially from its site of attachment at the glenoid rim.  There remains an  intact sleeve of periosteum attaching the labrum to the medial scapula (Fig. 1).
ALPSA (anterior labroligamentous periosteal sleeve avulsion) lesion
Bankart, fibrous vs osseous
Perthes lesion
GLAD lesion
An 18-year-old football player presents with a chief complaint of chronic left shoulder pain and decreased range of motion.  The patient reported a history of a traumatic dislocation two years ago for which the patient received no follow up treatment. The patient claims his shoulder has "fallen out of its socket" several times in the last six months.
