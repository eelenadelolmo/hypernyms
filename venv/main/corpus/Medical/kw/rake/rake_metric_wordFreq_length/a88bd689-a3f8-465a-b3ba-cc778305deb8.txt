Texto: 
Initial physical examination of the knee revealed a small joint effusion, but no deformity. The knee demonstrated full range of motion and there was no documentation of instability.
Lateral radiograph of the knee demonstrates a deep, irregular appearing lateral femoral sulcus, and a small joint effusion, but is otherwise normal (Fig 1). Follow up MR imaging demonstrates marrow edema in the lateral femoral condyle and in the posterior tibial plateau. The lateral femoral sulcus appears deepened and irregular in contour. T2-weighted sagittal image through the region of the intercondylar notch demonstrates complete disruption of the anterior cruciate ligament (Fig 2).

The patient was a 21-year man, who twisted his knee while playing in a softball game. Following the injury, he complained of difficulty running, pain in the posterolateral aspect of the knee and joint swelling.
The ‚Äúdeep lateral femoral notch‚Äù sign refers to an osteochondral impaction injury of the lateral femoral condyle that is associated with disruption of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). At the time of injury, the tibia translates anteriorly relative to the femur resulting in an impaction injury of the lateral femoral condyle against the posterior tibial plateau. Identification of the ‚Äúdeep‚Äù sulcus on the lateral radiograph of the knee is a clear indicator of significant trauma and has a high association with ACL disruption.
