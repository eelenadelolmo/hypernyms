Texto: 
Dry gangrene involving the distal right toes, with relative sparing of the second digit. Wet gangrene and cellulitis were seen more proximally on the foot. Multiple pressure ulcers seen on the plantar aspect of the foot as well as along over the 5th metatarsal head.
Patient ultimately had a below knee amputation.
Atrophic soft tissue of the great toe and 3-5th toes. Normal appearance of the 2nd toe soft tissue. Osteopenia and cortical destruction of the metatarsal heads especially of the 2-5th metatarsals. Heavily calficied vessels.
Osteomyelitis
76 y/o caucasian male with history of hypertension and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type II presented to the ED for evaluation of his discolored foot.
The patient's neuropathy made this a painless condition. He was wheelchair bound, so didn't ever look at the bottom of his feet.
