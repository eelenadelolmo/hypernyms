The MRI/MRA study showed no vascular pathology, but incidentally it was noted that there was a heterogeneous and mildly expanded clivus.

Whole body skeletal scintigraphy showed nonspecific increased uptake in the clivus region.

Repeat CT of the sinus was performed, revealing a ‚Äúground glass appearance‚Äù, containing a smaller circumscribed area, which has the appearance of a cystic lesion.  Overall the process appeared nonaggressive and was stable on 5 month follow-up CT.

41 year old female with increasing headaches and a family history of aneurysms. A head CT performed at another institution was reportedly unremarkable.  MRI/MR angiography of the Circle of Willis was performed at our institution to evaluate for possible aneurysm.
