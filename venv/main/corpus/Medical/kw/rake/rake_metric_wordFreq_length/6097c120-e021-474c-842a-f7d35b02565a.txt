Nose: Nasal cavities were found filled with nasal polypi, on auscultation heart sounds were heard on the right side (dextrocardia, liver could be palpated on the left side.
Radiological examination:  Xray chest revealed dextrocardia, abdominal gas shadow was seen on the right side.  Left lobe of diaphragm was found raised (due to the presence of liver on the left side (situs inverses totalis).  Lungs showed bronchiectatic changes.    CT scan para nasal sinuses both axial and coronal sections showed agenesis of frontal sinuses, hypoplastic maxillary sinus with loss of its medial wall (probably due to previous nasal surgeries.  The walls of the maxillary sinus showed sclerosis.  Seminal analysis showed immotile sperms.
Patient underwent nasal polypectomy to relieve his complaints of nasal obstruction.
â€¢ CT scan findings:
1. Agenesis of frontal sinuses
2. Hypoplastic maxillary sinuses
3. Bilateral ethmoidal polyps
4. Loss of medial wall of both maxillary sinuses

â€¢ Xray chest findings:
1. Dextrocardia
2. Lungs showed evidence of bronchiectasis
3. Left dome of diaphragm was found raised due to the presence of liver on the left side.
Kartagener syndrome
1. Kartagener syndrome
2. Young syndrome
C/o Nasal block and discharge both nasal cavities since childhood.  Head ache on and off 15 years, recurrent episodes of cough with sputum 25 years.  Patient did not have any children even after 10 years of marriage.  He underwent surgery for nasal bock thrice during the span of 20 years.
Even though polypectomy could improve nasal patency, the absence of ciliary movement cause the secretions in the nasal sinuses to be retained indefinitely.  Regular douching of the nasal cavities with alkaline saline must be resorted to clear the secretions from the nasal cavities.
