Dermoid cyst (Cystic Teratoma)
dermoid tumor (benign cystic teratoma)

40 y.o. female 10 months post-partum with a history of a left adnexal mass, probable dermoid, prior to pregnancy.  The patient was referred to Ultrasound for evaluation of the mass.  The patient had a right salpingo-oophorectomy previously for ovarian torsion.
This mass demonstrated the "tip of the iceberg" or "snowcapping" that is typical of the calcified components.
