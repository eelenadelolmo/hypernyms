Metastatic medullary thyroid cancer
Metastatic disease:
1. Mucinous carcinoma of colon, breast, or stomach
2. Ovarian carcinoma
3. Melanoma, osteosarcoma, carcinoid, leiomyosarcoma, thyroid
Benign Tumors:
1. Cavernous hemangioma
2. Congenital cyst
Vascular:
1. Hematoma
2. Calcified hepatic artery aneurysms
Infection:
1. Chronic granulomatous disease of childhood
2. Tuberculosis or histo
3. Old pyogenic or amebic abscesses
