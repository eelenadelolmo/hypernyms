Nontender, right testicular mass on examination.

LDH . . . . . . . . .   287 (115-222)       UNITS/L
B-HCG . . . . . . . . .  <2 (9)             mIU/mL
AFP TUMOR MARK. . . . . 2.0 (0.0-6.1)       NG/ML
Imaging for metastatic disease surveillance.
The right testicle is enlarged. There is a hypoechoic, heterogeneous expansile mass
within the right testicle which has nearly replaced the normal testicular tissue. This mass is hypervascular in appearance. The right epididymis is normal in size and appearance.
 
Imaging of the right renal fossa shows no ultrasonographic evidence of lymphadenopathy.
Seminoma
Tumor:
  -Primary: germinal(95%), nongerminal
  -Metastases / Lymphoma in pt over 50: prostate, kidney, leukemia, lymphoma
Infection:
  -Orchitis
  -Abscess
  -Granulomas (TB, Sarcoid, Histo - often bilateral/multiple)
Trauma:
  -fracture, rupture, hemorrhage, torsion (not with internal blood flow)
Presented to the ER with right testicular mass.
