The patient underwent emergent surgery which required cranialization of the frontal sinuses with drainage of the epidural abcess.
Non contrast CT demonstrated an isodense to grey matter-extraaxial, intracranial fluid collection that followed the convexity of the frontal cranium. It did not enhance after contrast - but showed rim enhancement of the displaced dura. There were numerous foci of air within it. Additionally, there was extensive paranasal sinus opacification with air fluid levels, most prominent in the left maxillary sinus and in  frontal and ethmoid sinuses bilaterally. There are bilateral inflammatory changes seen in the preseptal orbital tissues that extended over the zygomatic arches bilaterally.

MR imaging shows an epidural fluid collection with these signal characteristics: Iso to grey matter on T1, Hyperintense to grey matter on T2, FLAIR and DWI with low signal on ADC mapping. The child could not remain still enough for contrast enhanced MR images.

9 year old boy presented to the Emergency Department with a head ache and "swollen eyes". The patient had been treated for a sinus infection for 14 days but his head ache and eye swelling were getting worse despite finishing his course of antibiotics.
There was no bone breakdown. Transvenous thrombophlebitis may allow spread of sinus infection, while the bone remainas, apparently, intact. Another consideration would be microerosions of bone with direct spread from the contiguous frontal sinuses.   

The distinction between pre- vs post-septal orbital cellutitis was important in this case, as it would have changed operative approach. Venous thrombosis would not have changed the surgical approach; however it would portend a poor prognosis.
