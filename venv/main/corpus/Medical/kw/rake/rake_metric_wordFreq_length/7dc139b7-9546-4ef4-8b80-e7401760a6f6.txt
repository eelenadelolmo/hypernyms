-Chronic erosion and destruction at the discovertebral joint of T12-L1.  
-Old large bilateral paraspinal soft tissue masses with associated diffuse heterogeneous calcification
-Old calcified epidural extension of the abscess resulting in spinal canal stenosis at the T12-L1 level

65 year old male who initally presented with lower extremity weakness
CT scanning provides much better bony detail of irregular lytic lesions, sclerosis, disk collapse, and destruction of bone.  Soft tissue windows provide a good assessment of the soft tissues, including the epidural space and paraspinal areas. CT scanning reveals lesions earlier than plain film and is more effective for defining the shape and calcification of soft-tissue abscesses. Calcification is common in tuberculous lesions, unlike other forms of spinal osteomyelitis and diskitis.
