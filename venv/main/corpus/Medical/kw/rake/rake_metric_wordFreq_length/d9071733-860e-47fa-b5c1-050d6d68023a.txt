Texto: 
Weakness in both upper and lower extremities, right greater than left.
Multiple lesions within the brain. The most prominent were in the left frontal and parietal region. The lesions were very hyperintense on T2, and demonstrated only peripheral enhancement
Chondrosarcoma metastatic to Brain
Given the marked hyperintensity on T2 and history of chondrosarcoma, this is the most likely diagnosis.  Metastases from other locations could also be in the differential.
55 yo woman with history of a resected left lower extremity chondrosarcoma.  Known to have lung metastases, she presents now with right upper and lower extremity weakness.
