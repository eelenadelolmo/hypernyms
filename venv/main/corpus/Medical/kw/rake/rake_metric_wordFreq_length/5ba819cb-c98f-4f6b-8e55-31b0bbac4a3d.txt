Contrast materialâ€“enhanced CT scan of the abdomen demonstrates the typical multilayered appearance of a small bowel intussusceptions or a targetlike mass.  In this case multiple small bowel to small bowel intussusceptions. The small bowel proximal to this is distended measuring up to 5.2 cm in diameter. Also within the right lower abdomen a further small bowel to small bowel intussusception is noted

Volvulus
Small bowel mickel diverticulum
Adenopathy
19y/d WM who was transferred from OSH secondary to hypotention, anemia, syncope and melena of unknown duration.
