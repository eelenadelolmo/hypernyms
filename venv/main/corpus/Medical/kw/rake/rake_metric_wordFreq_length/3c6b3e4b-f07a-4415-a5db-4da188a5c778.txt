Initial radiographs demonstrate no abnormalities.

Follow up radiographs obtained two to three weeks later demonstrate interval development of a band of sclerosis at the inferior aspect of the right femoral neck concerning for stress fracture.

MR images obtained two days after the second set of radiographs demonstrate an irregular linear band of low signal on T1 and T2 weighted images within the distal right femoral neck, with adjacent low T1 signal and adjacent increased T2 signal, consistent with a stress fracture.
