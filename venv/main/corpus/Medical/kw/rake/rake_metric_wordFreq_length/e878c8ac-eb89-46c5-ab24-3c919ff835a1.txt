Texto: 
Surgical resection can be attempted if the site of heterotopic bone formation becomes symptomatic, but the recurrence is common.  The concurrent use of an anti-inflammatory agent like indomethecin has been proposed to reduce recurrence.  Surgeons can use bone scans to determine the right time for surgery when the activity within the heterotopic bone formation is similar to activity within the adjacent bone.
Bone scan of the hip and proximal femurs demonstrates increased soft tissue uptake adjacent to but not within the right acetabulum.  Correlation with plain film radiographs demonstrates ossification within the soft tissues adjacent to the right acetabulum, confirming heterotopic ossification.   Bone scan findings of heterotopic ossification can precede radiographic findings by 4-6 weeks.
