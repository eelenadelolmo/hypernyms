Patient had drop of Hct from 34 on presentation to 22 during evaluation in the emergency department.

1. Collapsed Ovarian Cyst [Arrowhead]: small (1.6cm) right adnexal hypodensity with hyperdense rim. 
2. Clot [measurement]: large (9x5x12cm)heterogeneous mass (density 50-70 Hounsfield units)in the rectouterine fossa (Pouch of Douglas) resulting in displacement of the uterus anteriorly and rectum posterolaterally.
3. Intra-uterine device [Arrow]
