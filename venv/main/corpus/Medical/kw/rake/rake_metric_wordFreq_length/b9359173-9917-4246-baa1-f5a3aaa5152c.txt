Abdomen soft and nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds all four quadrants of the abdomen.  No rebound tenderness or involuntary guarding.  Positive mild right costovertebral angle tenderness to percussion.

UA: glucose negative, bilirubin negative, ketones negative, specific gravity 1.025, trace blood, pH 5.0, urobilinogen 0.2 E.U./dL, nitrite negative, leukocyte esterase negative.

WBC 4.2, HGB 15.8, HCT 46.4, PLTs 188, glucose 86, BUN 20, creat 1.1, Na+ 139, K 3.8, Cl- 105, CO2 26, anion gap 8, Ca++ 9.5, total protein 7.3, alk phos 94, AST 16, ALT 24, total bili 0.7, direct bili 0.3.
Pain control, hydration (2-3 L/day), strain urine to recover the stone.
Noncontrast axial computed tomographic images of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate a 3 mm calculus within the right ureter at the ureterovesical junction with mild dilitation of the right renal pelvis and right ureter suggesting a degree of obstruction.  Two nonobstructing calculi within the upper pole of the right kidney and a single nonobstructing calculus within the interpolar region of the left kidney are also demonstrated.  There are no solid or cystic renal lesions.  The left ureter is of normal caliber and follows a normal course without evidence of ureterolithiasis.
