T 37.1 P123 RR 48  BP 84/palp
The patient was sitting up and playing.  An audible inspiratory stridor was noted
Lungs:  inspiratory stridor noted, without rhonchi, wheeze, or rales; Upper airway course noises noted.  
Rest of exam: WNL
To date there is no cure for RRP.  Classic treatment involves a CO2 laser for removal of lesions in the laryngx, pharynx, upper trachea, nasal and oral cavities.  CO2 lasers can be used through a flexible bronchoscope.  HPV is vaporized during the process, so every effort must be made to protect the lung tissue.  HPV in the lung tissue is associated with squamous cell carcinoma.  Medical intervention may also be required.
Chest X-ray: 
Prominent  markings  with  small  amount  of  hazy  lingular atelectasis  versus  possible infiltrate

Air Flouroscopy: 
Polypoid  mass  at  the  level  the  epiglottis.

 Barium Swallow:
Partially  obstructive  mass  in  the  trachea  at  the  level  the epiglottis.

 Chest CT: (no included)
1.  Areas  of  atelectasis  are  present  in  the  right  middle  lobe,  lingula, and  right  upper  lobe.  Bronchiectasis  is  present  in  the  right  middle  lobe and  lingula.
2.  Small  areas  of  parenchymal  opacity  are  also  present  bilaterally, primarily  in  the  right  upper  lobe  without  evidence  of  cavitation.  No distinct  nodule  is  identified.    Small  scattered  areas  of  air  trapping  are present  in  the  lungs  bilaterally  consistent  with  small  airways  disease.
Respiratory (Laryngotracheal) Papillomatosis
Asthma, croup, allergies, vocal nodules, bronchitis
This is a 19 month old female presenting with 3 months history of difficulty breathing and with new inspiratory stridor.  This was associated with difficulty swallowing, and regurgitation.   Further mom noted retractions during eating.  Mom denies cough, fever, changes in appetite, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  The patient had several recent hospitalizations and visits to the ED where she was diagnosed and treated for croup and asthma.
Mom had active HPV at the time of delivery, but that is not currently an indication for operative delivery.  RRP is caused by the HPV, which infects the baby has it passes through the birth canal.  The child usually develops symptoms within one year of life, which include hoarseness and inspiratory stridor.  Diagnosis is met with flexible bronchoscopy and biopsy.  There is no definitive cure but CO2 lasers and shaving techniques have been successful in management of the symptoms.  Adjunctive therapy is often required with anti-viral medication.  A subsequent sibling has been diagnosed with the disease as well.

There are over 150 types of human papilloma virus (HPV); and, RRP is caused by two types called HPV 6 and HPV 11. Most HPV-caused cancers are related to HPV types 16 and 18.  HPV infections are the most common sexually transmitted infections in the United States. Roughly 14 million new genital HPV infections occur each year. CDC estimates that more than 90% of sexually active men and 80% of women will have at least one type of HPV; and, one-half will be a high-risk HPV type.  FDA has approved three vaccines to prevent HPV infection: GardasilÂ®, GardasilÂ® 9, and CervarixÂ®.

Rarely, RRP may be associated with development of lung cancer.
