Texto: 
Vitals: Afebrile. BP 97/55, HR 77, RR 18. 
Appearance: In NAD.
Mentation: A&O x 3. 
Eyes: No scleral icterus.
Lungs: Fine bibasilar crackles.
Heart: RRR
Abdomen: Mildly distended abdomen with subtle caput. The umbilical hernia sac appears hyperpigmented with a focal area of necrosis. Abdomen is nontender. Mild splenomegaly.
Neuro: Unremarkable.
Extremities: 3+ pitting edema of the bilateral lower extremities.

PT/PTT/INR - 16.7/33.7/1.3
1) Ultrasound 24 hours status post TIPS for a shunt baseline.
2) Routine shunt surveillance at 3 month intervals for the first year and at 6-12 month intervals thereafter.
1) CT CHEST
a) Axial contrast-enhanced CT image through the upper abdomen demonstrates a small liver with a nodular contour. The umbilical vein is recannalized and large caliber. There is  perihepatic layering ascites and a moderate sized right pleural effusion. 
b) Axial contrast-enhanced CT image through the upper abdomen demonstrates, again, a small nodular liver. The spleen appears slightly enlarged.

2)ULTRASOUND - PRE TIPS
a) Long liver 11.0 cm.
b) Long spleen 16.1 cm.
c) Recannalized paraumbilical vein is a hypoechoic serpiginous tubular structure in the region of the ligamentum teres between the medial left and lateral left segments of the liver. 
d) Recannalized paraumbilical vein with hepatofugal flow consistent with portal hypertension.
e) Main portal vein is patent. The Doppler waveform is venous but flow directionality is equivocal (hepatopetal versus hepatofugal). Likely the focal pulsatile appearance mid waveform is artifactual versus a manifestation of right heart dysfunction (patient with no known history). 

3) TIPS:
a) Hepatic venogram.
b) On portal venous puncture, the right portal vein opacifies with contrast administration. The portal system is successfully accessed for portosystemic shunt placement.
c) The parenchymal Wallstent is deployed and dilated to 12 mm. Its course is a smooth curve. The portosystemic shunt gradient is < 12 mmHg.
TRANSJUGULAR INTRAHEPATIC PORTOSYSTEMIC SHUNT (TIPS)
PORTAL HYPERTENSION DIFFERENTIAL:
A) INTRAHEPATIC
- Presinusoidal
1) Hepatic fibrosis
2) Schistosomiasis
3) Lymphoma
4) Sarcoidosis
- Postsinusoidal
1) Cirrhosis
2) Venoocclusive disease

B) EXTRAHEPATIC
- Prehepatic
1) Portal vein thrombosis
2) Portal vein compression
- Posthepatic
1) Hepatic vein thrombosis
2) IVC obstruction
3) Constrictive pericarditis

C) HYPERDYNAMIC (Arterio-portal fistula)
51 year old male with a history of ESLD (HCV, ETOH) with intractable ascites requires weekly to biweekly large volume paracentesis. He presents to the hospital after his long-standing umbilical hernia burst in the shower releasing an estimated 1 gallon of ascitic fluid.
