Texto: 
Palpable nodule within the right thyroid, approximately 2 cm in diameter.
The visualized nodule was biopsied by fine needle aspiration (images not shown) at the same visit.

RIGHT THYROID NODULE, FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION: 
Papillary carcinoma (see note).
		
Note: Aspirate smears are highly cellular, containing scant colloid and numerous atypical follicular cells with nuclear enlargement, increased N:C ratio, and cytologic crowding. These are arranged in sheets, clusters and occasional papillae, some surrounding psammomatoid calcifications.  Occasional cells with small intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions are identified, as are cells with nuclear grooves, and some with small nucleoli. Many multinucleated histiocytes are also observed.	
		
Recommendation: Excision.

The patient was referred to ENT for surgical evaluation.
A 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.6 cm nodule of heterogeneous echotexture and irregular borders is present within the right thyroid lobe with scattered internal calcifications and internal vascularity.
