1. Gallbladder is normal - no further follow up is needed
2. Individuals with Medullary Sponge Kidney have a normal lifespan with only a slight increased risk of hematuria, infection and stone formation.  No specific follow up is required, but increased attentiveness to clinical changes is recommended.
1. Gallbladder is unremarkable - no sonographic Murphy's sign

2. The right kidney is normal in size and contour with normal corticomedullary differentiation. The renal collecting system is decompressed. There are multiple hyperechoic foci within the medullary pyramids, the largest measuring approximately 1 cm in greatest diameter with posterior acoustic shadowing, consistent with multiple  medullary stones.

3. Comparison CT demonstrates medullary calcifications
