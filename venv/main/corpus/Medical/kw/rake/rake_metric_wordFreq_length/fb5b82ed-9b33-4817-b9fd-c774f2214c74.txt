1. Flow images demonstrate hyperemia of the soft tissues of the right lower extremity.

2. Blood pool images demonstrate increased radiotracer accumulation in a curvilinear fashion in the lateral soft tissue of the right distal residual limb.

3. Delayed images of the lower extremities demonstrate a corresponding area of increased radiotracer accumulation in a curvilinear fashion in the lateral soft tissue of the right distal residual limb.

4. Plain radiograph of the right residual limb confirms the heterotopic ossification.
Heterotopic Ossification
Heterotopic Ossification
Myositis Ossificans
23 year-old OIF male s/p bilateral lower extremity amputations with significant heterotopic ossification affecting prosthetic fitting and training.  Please evaluate for activity of heterotopic ossification at distal right residual limb.
