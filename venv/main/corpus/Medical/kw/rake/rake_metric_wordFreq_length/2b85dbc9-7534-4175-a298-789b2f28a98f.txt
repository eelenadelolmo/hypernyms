Physical exam revealed no palpable thyroid nodule.
Calcitonin levels >500 (elevated)
-unknown
-MRI demonstrates a nodule in the left thyroid lobe with peripheral T2 signal peripherally and intermediate signal internally.
-Fusion PET/CT images demonstrate that the thyroid nodule is FDG-avid.
-Ultrasound images demonstrate that the nodule is hypoechoic with a thin, linear echogenic focus and a small cystic area.  There is mild hyperemia internally and peripherally
Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma
-Medullary thyroid cancer
-Anaplastic thyroid cancer
-Metastatic disease
