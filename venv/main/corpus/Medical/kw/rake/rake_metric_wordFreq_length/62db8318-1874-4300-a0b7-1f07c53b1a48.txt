scoliosis
Axial images demonstrate diastematomyelia with a bony spur at the L3,4 levels and a vertbral segmentation anomaly at this same level. The conus medullaris is low lying after the two hemicords reunite. The split occurs at approximately T12 with the reuniting of the cords at approximately L5/S1.  Marked biphasic scoliosis is present as well.  The left kidneyis incidentaly noted to be malrotated.
