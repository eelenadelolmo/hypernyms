2 year old boy with a 1 month history of ataxia and nausea and vomiting.
The most common posterior fossa masses are astrocytoma and medulloblastoma (PNET - primitive neuroectodermal tumor).  Astrocytomas are most often fluid secreting pilocytic astrocytoma, WHO Gr1, and lateral in the cerebellar hemisphere.  Midline masses involving the fourth ventricle are usually medullblastoma, that arise in the vermis and secondarily invade.  Measured by incidence, ependymoma is in third place.
