Normal neurologic examination
-Conservative if asymptomatic
-Surgical if causing significant symptoms or sequela of associated mass effect
CSF signal intensity mass at superior aspect of 4th ventricle with mass effect on quadrigeminal plate and distortion of 4th ventricle
Arachnoid Cyst
1) Arachnoid cyst

2) Epidermoid cyst

3) Cystic mass 

* See discussion for imaging differentiation.
22 y/o male with mild dizziness and headache
**FLAIR, DWI/ADC, and post-gadolinium T1 are key imaging sequences determining the nature of cystic appearing masses.  These otherwise could appear similar on standard T1 and T2 imaging.

Arachnoid cyst:  follows CSF on all sequences (suppresses on FLAIR and no restricted diffusion on DWI/ADC), causes mass effect on adjacent structures, may cause bony remodeling, may show delayed opacification with intrathecal contrast, no enhancement

Epidermoid cyst:  Should show increased signal on FLAIR images and restricted diffusion on DWI/ADC, more insinuating with encasement of structures

Atrophy or encephalomalacia:  Follows CSF on all imaging sequences, No mass effect with vascular structures passing through the region, sulci enlarged

Cystic mass: enhancing portion of cystic mass
