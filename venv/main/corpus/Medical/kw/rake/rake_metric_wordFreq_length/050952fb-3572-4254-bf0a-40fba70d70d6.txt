Orthopedic consultation with evaluation for possible soft tissue repair and/or limited carpal arthrodeses.
AP and Lateral Radiographs of the left Wrist show that the lunate bone is tipped dorsally.  The scapholunate angle is greater than 60 degrees.  The capitate-lunate angle is greater than 20 degrees.  There is also widening of the scapholunate interval above its normal interval of 2 mm.  No acute fracture lucency or evidence of degenerative changes involving the wrist.
Dorsal Intercalated Segment Instability (DISI) with Scapholunate Dissociation
Dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI)

Associations:  Unstable fracture of the scaphoid 
               Scapholunate Dissociation

Volar intercalated segment instability (VISI)

Associations:  Lunotriquetral dissociation

Presents complaining of pain over the radial side of his wrist for several months.  The symptoms began after a fall on his outstretched hand.
This patient has dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI) associated with scapholunate dissociation.  This is the most common type of carpal instability.  As in this case, a fall on the outstretched hand with the blow directed at the hypothenar eminence is the most common mechanism for this injury.  The normal scapholunate interval should be less than 2 mm.  An interval greater than 4 mm is pathognomonic for scapholunate dissociation.  This patient’s scapholunate interval is increased above 2 mm which suggests scapholunate dissociation.  An unstable scaphoid fracture is another common cause for DISI; however, this patient’s scaphoid was intact with no evidence of fracture.

When diagnosing DISI, one must measure the capitate-lunate angle and scapholunate angle.  The capitate-lunate angle is less than 20-30 degrees in a normal patient.  The axis of the capitate is drawn from the midpoint of its head to the center of its articular surface with the lunate.  The axis of the lunate is drawn perpendicular to a line through its distal poles.  If the capitate-lunate angle is greater than 20-30 degrees, a DISI or VISI (Volar Intercalated Segment Instability) may be present.  In a DISI, the scapholunate angle is often greater than 60 degrees and the lunate is tipped dorsally as demonstrated in this case.  The axis for the scaphoid bone is drawn as a line connecting its proximal and distal volar convexities.  A scapholunate angle greater than 60 degrees is associated with scapholunate dissociation.  In a VISI, the scapholunate angle is less than 30 degrees with the lunate tipped in a volar direction.  A VISI is much less common than a DISI, and it is the most frequent carpal instability pattern encountered in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Scapholunate dissociation associated with a DISI can result in degeneration and collapse of the medial scaphoid, lateral lunate, and radiocarpal joint.  When this occurs, the process is described as a SLAC (scapholunate dissociation with advanced collapse) wrist.  This patient does not have a SLAC wrist; however, he is at risk for developing one if no treatment is initiated.
