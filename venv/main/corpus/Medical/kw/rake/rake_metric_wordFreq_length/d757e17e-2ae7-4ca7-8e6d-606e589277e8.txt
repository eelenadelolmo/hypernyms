Pulmonary AVM (PAVM) are associated with complications including systemic embolization of clots and bacteria, brain abscess and infarction, hemoptysis, and hemothorax.  Large shunts may cause hypoxia/cyanosis and heart failure.
• CXR shows a solitary pulmonary nodule/opacity within the left lower lobe.  

• Axial CT images of the chest demonstrate a well-defined solitary peripheral mass with curvilinear structures extending to/from,  consistent with feeding arteries and draining veins.
Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformation (PAVM)
• Arteriovenous Malformation
• Hamartoma
• Old Granulomatous Disease
• Malignant neoplasm  
• Solitary metastases
This asymptomatic 27 y.o. woman had a routine screening chest radiograph.  No family history.
Pulmonary AVM (PAVM) are associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, an autosomal dominant disease with a prevalence of roughly 1/10,000 in some populations.
