An MRI showed a large right cerebellar mass with effacement of the fourth ventricle and hydrocephalus.  Subtotal resection of the mass was performed.
Fig 1. Axial T1 weighted MRI shows coarse striations resulting from irregular, abnormally thickened cerebellar folia.

Fig 2. Axial T2 weighted MRI also showing the same coarse striations resulting from abnormally thick cerebellar folia. 

Fig 3. Gross appearance of a portion of the surgical specimen showing the coarse widened folia.

Fig 4. Low magnification histological section showing subpial of myelinated fibers overlying a band of large neurons that replace the Purkinje cells and outer portion of the internal granular cell layer. 

Fig 5. Higher magnification of the abnormal large neurons.

This 56 year old woman had breast carcinoma for which she  had bilateral mastectomies six years apart. She also had a thyroidectomy in her twenties. Six years after the second mastectomy, she developed gait unsteadiness that progressed to the point that she was unable to walk.
The associated breast cancer and thyroid disease form the constellation of findings known as Cowden disease - an autosomal dominant phakomatosis.
