Texto: 
Right adnexal tenderness to palpation without a mass.

Quantitative hCG was 18,000 mIU/ml.
The patient was taken to the operating room where an ectopic pregnancy was visualized and an salpingectomy performed.
fetal pole with heart rate in rt fallopian tube
Ectopic Pregnancy
There is no differential when a fetal pole with cardiac activity is seen outside the uterus.
25 yeal old pregnant female, at approximately 6 weeks gestation, presents to the emergency room with right adnexal pain.  She is status post bilateral tubal ligation with reanastomosis.  Follow up HSG demonstrated unilateral right sided tube patency with evidence of stricture at anastomotic site.  The patient has been actively trying to conceive 'naturally' for two years without success.
This case is distinct from those that show findings consistent with an ectopic pregnancy, in that the imaging confirms the extrauterine fetal pole.
