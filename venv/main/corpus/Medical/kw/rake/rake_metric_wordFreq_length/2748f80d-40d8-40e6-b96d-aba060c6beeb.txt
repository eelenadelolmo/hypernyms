Texto: 
Palpable large left-sided varicocele.
None required, however, surgical ligation should be considered given the patient's history of undesired infertility.
Ultrasound images demonstrate multiple left peritesticular small, round, cystic structures that communicate with each other (appreciated on real-time cine images) consistent with dilated peristesticular veins.  Most of these structures are 2-3 mm or greater in diameter.  Augmented venous flow is demonstrated during Valsalva maneuver.
