• Abdomen distended
• Lower extremity swelling
Supra renal IVC filter placement
• 16 x 13 x 10 cm pelvic mass
• ascites and left pleural effusion
• suprarenal IVC thrombus
• renal vein thombus
• omental caking
Supra-renal inferior vena cava thrombus
Tumor thrombus
Bland thrombus
28 y.o. woman with an acute onset of abdominal pain three days ago, preceded by  a 9-10 day bout of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia.
Determined level of thrombus from CT and placed filter without venogram to avoid causing embolization.

The reason that thrombus occurred above and within the renal veins was indeterminate. The initial pathology for the pelvic mass was leiomyoma.  
The patient is undergoing further workup to evaluate cause of ascites and pleural effusion.
