Texto: 
• Afebrile
• No tenderness to palpation of the maxillary and frontal sinuses
• Full range of motion of the jaw
• No erythema of the skin, conjunctiva, or sclera of the eye
• Extra ocular muscles were intact
• Pupils were equally round and reactive to light 
• Vision 20/20
Treatment: The patient under went resection of the facial mass and arterial embolization of the left renal mass prior to 3/22/2011.

Followup: The patient has been followed continously and the renal mass is stable according to the last CT of the abdomen on 4/10/2012
CT of the head 12/3/2010
» 3.5 x2.5 x2.3 cm invasive destructive mass at the junction of the left zygomatic arch, left maxillary sinus and inferiolateral wall of the left orbit
»contains small bony fragments

MRI of the head 12/14/2010
» 3.5cm expansile mass centered at the malar eminence. 
» Mass enhaced homogeneously except for small areas of hypointensisty. 
» Flow voids within the mass

MRA of the head  12/14/2010
» Enlarged blood vessels seen extending toward and within the left orbital mass.  
» The hypervascularity of the mass is suggestive of a metastasis

CT of the abdomen and pelvis 1/25/2011
» 5 cm lower pole left renal mass
» Heterogeneus enhancement with contrast
» Contains calcifications
» No renal vein involvement
» No significant lymph node enlargment

Post treatment CT of the head 3/22/2011
» Resection of the mass
» Lateral wall of the orbit has been resected
» Surgical mesh in place
» Lateral and anterior wall of maxillary sinus have been resected
» Postoperative fibrotic soft tissue at site 

Post Treatment CT of the abdomen and pelvis 3/22/2011
» 5 cm mass at lower pole left kidney
» metal artifact at the left renal hilum consistiant with embolization
» Increased area of hypodensity suggesting devascularization
» IVC filter in place

Follow up CT of the abdomen and pelvis 4/10/2012
» Stable Renal mass
Renal Cell Carcinoma
• Squamous cell cancer 
• Osteosarcoma
• Chondrosarcoma
• Hemangiopericytoma
• Hypervascluar metastasis
63 yo man, smoker, presents with proptosis of his left eye.  The patient denied any trauma, facial pain, or change in vision.
When thinking about Renal Cell Carcinoma the classic triad of flank pain, hematuria, and flank mass should enter your mind.  This, however, is a rare occurrence and most individuals are diagnosed due to an incidental finding during abdominal imaging for another reason. This case unique because the initial clinical manifestation was proptosis of the left eye and not one of the typical things you think of when dealing with renal cell carcinoma. 

The initial CT showed a mass causing bony erosion.  This finding triggered followup imaging with the MRA and MRI which revealed that the 3 cm mass was vascular and most likely a metastatic lesion.  The next CT of the abdomen was to look for the primary tumor and unfortunately was found on the left kidney.

The biopsy definitively conformed the diagnosis of metastasis but it was the radiologist's interpretation of the imagining that caused the primary team to look deeper into the origins of the facial mass.
