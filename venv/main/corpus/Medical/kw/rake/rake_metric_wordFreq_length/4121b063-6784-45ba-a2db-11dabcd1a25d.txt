Texto: 
Left lower quarant pain to palpation, negative urinalysis, normal WBC count
Prone to stone formation where the ureter crosses the anterior fused portion of the renal parenchyma.  No specific follow-up.
CT was performed without contrast to look for a ureteral stone, and because this rather portly gentleman had plenty of mesenteric contrast agent (i.e fat)
Horseshoe Kidney
Incidentally noted Horseshoe kidney
