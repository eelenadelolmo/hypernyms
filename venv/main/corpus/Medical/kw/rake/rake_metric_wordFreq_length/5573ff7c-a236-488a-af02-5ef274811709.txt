PHYSICAL EXAM:	1-2 cm ulcerated nodule on the left thumb. He also had a 5mm violaceous papule on his right palm 
LABORATORY:  CBC, SMA7, LFT's and UA were all within normal limits. Chest X-ray showed a right apical density. Follow up CT scan of the chest showed a non mass-like pleural based opacity in the right lung apex most suggestive of pleuro-parenchymal scarring. It also revealed a borderline sized carinal lymph node. HISTOPATHOLOGY: Ulceration with transdermal atypical lymphoreticular infiltrate of Ki-1 positive T-lymphocytes and numerous eosinophils.
No treatment.
LYMPHOMATOID PAPULOSIS (1997 Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, Case#18A) submitted by: Stephen Flax CDR, MC, USN
Presented with a 20 year intermittent history of
recurring crops of erythematous papules at various body
sites. Some of these lesions would break down in the center and heal in 1-2 months usually with scarring. He presented to our emergency department with a 2-3 week history of an ulcerated enlarging lesion on his left thumb. This was only mildly tender. At the same time he had a new lesion emerging on his right palm.
