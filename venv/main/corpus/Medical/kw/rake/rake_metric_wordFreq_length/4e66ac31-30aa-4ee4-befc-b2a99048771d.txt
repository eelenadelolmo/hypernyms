Neoplasm (metastasis)
54 year old woman with known metastatic colon cancer involving the liver and mesenteric lymph nodes.  She now presents with left sided tongue atrophy and neck pain when turning her head to the left.
The CT scan of the skull base was interpreted as being normal.  

The Radiation therapist ask for a review of the study in light of the Nuclear Bone Scan which had been done 3 weeks prior to the CT scan.  AT the point the subtle lesion was detected.

MRI was not done due to claustrophobia.
