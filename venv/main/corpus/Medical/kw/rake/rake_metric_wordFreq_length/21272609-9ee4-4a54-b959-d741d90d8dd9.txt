Meningiomas are the most common extra axial tumors.  They are derived from meningothelial cells within the arachnoid granulations.  Most meningiomas are sporadic and most commonly occur in middle aged females.  However, multiple meningiomas may be seen in patients with NF2, familial or patients status-post radiation.  Meningiomas are typically divided into 3 categories; benign, atypical meningioma and anaplastic meningioma.  Most meningiomas are found supartentorial which accounts for approximately 90 percent.  The cerebellopontine angle location makes up less than 5 percent of all meningiomas.  Imaging characteristics of meningiomas under CT are hyper to isodense and demonstrate strong enhancement.  Many will show calcification or cystic areas and up to 20 percent may show a bony change such as hyperostosis.  Imaging characterics under MR are isointense on T1, hyperintense on T2 and will show strong enhancement with the possibility of a dural tail.  Angiography may demonstrate a spoke wheel appearance with a persistant blush, strong early uptake of contrast and will persist through the venous phase.
