â€¢ Decreased level of consciousness.
â€¢ No focal neurological deficit noted.
Vitamin K and supportive therapy
â€¢ CT shows "thickening" of the falx and the tentorium bilaterally
â€¢ MRI shows extensive bilateral extraaxial subdural fluid consistent with hematoma (SDH) overlying both cerebral hemispheres.  The SDH is also seen layering in between the cerebral hemishperes; and, along the tentorial leaves - extending into posterior fossa.
Acute bilateral subdural hematomas, convexity, interhemispheric, tentorial
â€¢ Subdural empyema
â€¢ Subdural hematoma
â€¢ Subarachnoid hematoma
â€¢ Epidural  hematoma
