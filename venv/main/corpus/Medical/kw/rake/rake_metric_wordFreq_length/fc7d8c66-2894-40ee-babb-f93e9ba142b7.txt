Slender male, currently asymptomatic.
Thus far, this patient has been received medical therapy only.  Interval clinical and radiologic reevaluation is planned, with the reevaluation interval to be determined based on symptoms and disease progression.
Several regions of discontinuous and asymmetric bowel wall thickening with alternating regions of dilation.  No fistulas were identified in this patient‚Äôs case.  Enhancement localized to the regions of mural thickening was demonstrated following the administration of intravenous gadolinium DTPA.
Crohn Disease

&#61550;	Metastases / lymphoma
54 year-old male with recurrent abdominal pain and diarrhea.
The exact etiology of Crohn‚Äôs disease is unknown.  There is a familial disposition.  Most common age of presentation is 15-25 years, with an equal distribution between the sexes.  There is a four-fold increase in incidence amongst smokers.  The most common presenting symptoms include diarrhea, pain, melena, weight loss and fever.  

Associated abnormalities include arthritis, cholelithiasis, sclerosing cholangitis, uveitis and ankylosing spondylitis.  Based on pathology, there are three stages of Crohn‚Äôs disease.  The early stage includes hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue and shallow mucosal erosions (aphthoid ulcers).  The intermediate stage is defined by transmural extension within the mucosa and subserosa with marked fold thickening.  The advanced stage includes transmural extension to and through the serosa and deep ulcerations and fissures.

Lesions can occur anywhere along the entire length of the gut, from the mouth to the anus.  The terminal ileum and proximal colon are the most common sites of involvement.  Skip lesions more commonly involve the distal ileum.

10-20% of patients lead symptom-free lives.  Medical treatment includes steroids, azathioprine, mesalamine, and antibiotics.  Surgical treatment involves resection of the affected bowel.  30-53% recur after surgical resection.
