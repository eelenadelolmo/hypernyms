Diffuse TTP, Soft, non-distended, +BS, No HSM, No rebound tenderness.
CT demonstrates homogeneous density of thickened bowel wall with intestinal lumen surrounded by edematous mucosa.  The distal jejunum and terminal ileum were involve.  Intervening segments of bowel were unremarkable.
Subsequent colonoscopy demonstrated nodularity within the terminal ileum.
Small bowel follow through revealed delayed transit time with persistent narrowing and thickening of the distal jejunum and terminal ileum.
Crohns Disease
Thickened small bowel  folds are nonspecific and can be seen in a wide variety of condtions, including : Inflammatory bowel dieseae, other inflammatory conditions, ischemia, hemorrhage,infection (TB, celiac). neoplasm (lymphoma, carcniod, adenocarcinoma) and amyloidosis.
Decreased Small Bowel transit time is possible in: Inflammatory bowel dieseae, Hypothyroidism, Diabetes, Scleroderma, Opiate use or Celiac disease.
19 year-old male with epigastric abdominal pain and hematochezia.
Crohns disease is an idiopathic inflammatory process which can involve any part of the GI tract from the esophagus to rectum (small bowel-80%).  This patient's findings are limited to the distal jejunum and terminal ileum.  These findings constitue "skip lesions", or discontinous involvement of bowel segments, with normal intervening bowel.
Crohns can be categorized into 3 phases: early, advanced and stenotic.  This patient's presentation is most consistent with the early phase which includes nodular enlargement of lymphoid follices with obstructive lyphedema fist arising in the T.I..  Later, "advanced" findings may include  coboblestoning and lumenal narrowing.  The final or "stenotic phase" involve strictures with dilated proximal loops.
Crohns Disease can exhibit many extraintestinal manifestations including hepatobiliary, GU, MSK findings.  This young patient did not demonstrate any of these at this point.
