Post-treatment hypocalcemia is a follow-up concern.
Ultrasound: hypoechoic region adjacent to the left thyroid lobe consistent with parathyroid tissue that is abnormally enlarged, corresponding in location to the scintigraphic abnormality.

Tc-99m sestamibi scintigraphy: A focal nodular uptake abnormality, intensifying during the imaging interval relative to the thyroid gland, best localized to the lower third of the left lobe of the thyroid gland.  More precise localization is not possible with planar imaging, but did occur with SPECT (not shown).  SPECT imaging localized the focus to the posterior aspect of the lower pole of the left lobe of the thyroid gland. 

No additional uptake abnormality is detected in the neck or mediastinum.
