Surgery.
Portable abdomen demonstrates a "double-bubble" sign with no distal abdominal gas.  This radiographic finding and given clinical history was diagnostic and patient went for surgery soon after. Post-op films show enteric tube following the expected course of the proximal small bowel in the mid abdomen, with interval decompression of the stomach and proximal duodenum.
Additionally, limited visualization of the lung bases demonstrates abnormally increased pulmonary vascular and interstitial markings consistent with shunt vascularity and edema, likely the sequelae of congenital heart disease.
Duodenal Atresia
Plain film findings with history nearly pathognomonic, but DDX of High Obstruction:
1-Malrotation with or without Midgut Volvulus
2-Doudenal-Jejunal Atresia
3-Annular Pancreas
4-Duodenal web or Diverticulum (intraluminal)
5-Preduodenal Portal Vein
Newborn infant with bilious vomiting in first 24 hours of life.
