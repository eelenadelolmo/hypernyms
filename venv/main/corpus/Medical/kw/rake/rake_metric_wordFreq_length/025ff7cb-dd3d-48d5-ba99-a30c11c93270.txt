Texto: 
Palpable mass in left adnexa.  No fever, normal WBC count.
Most patients undergo surgical excision, as ovarian torsion is the most common complication.  Rarely (3%) Dermoid Cysts may undergo malignant transformation.
US:

Complex solid and cystic mass with multiple interfaces and a hyperechoic focus with posterior shadowing compatible with calcification.

Normal ovarian blood flow - no torsion.

Other findings, not specifically seen in this case, are fat/fluid levels, the tip of the iceberg sign and a fine mesh-like pattern which represents matted hair.
Ovarian Dermoid Cyst
Dermoid cyst
Ovarian neoplasm
TOA with a focus of air (also hyperechoic with dirty posterior shadowing) - unlikely in this case, as pt did not have symptoms of infection/PID
32 yo F presents to ER with left sided pelvic pain and palpable mass.  Rule out torsion.
- Benign germ cell tumor
- Well differentiated derivatives of 3 germ cell layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm -> Fat, sebaceous fluid, hair, bone, teeth
- The most common ovarian neoplasm (5-25%)
- Bilateral (10-25%)
- Rare malignant transformation (3%)
- Most common complication is torsion
