All aortic aneurysms must be monitored for risk of rupture, which can be fatal.  A follow up MRI should be conducted at six months after the initial imaging or at the time of symptom development if this occurs earlier.  If unchanged at that time the interval can be extended to one year.  Expansion merits a decreased interval and is dependent on rate of expansion, etiology and comorbidity.  Control of blood pressure is emphasized and beta-blockers are the primary agent used to target blood pressure in the 105-120 mmHg range.   Other antihypertensive classes should be added if the target is exceeded.  Primary care should communicate and coordinate with the patent‚Äôs cardiologist.  If greater than 5.5 cm, surgical repair or endovascular stenting is indicated.

57 y.o. woman presents for follow-up after an MVC 10/20/1X.  She was driving through an intersection when the other vehicle T-boned her care on the passenger side door.  She was belted and the airbag deployed compressing her chest.  She was going approximately 30 mph while the speed of the other vehicle is not known.

She was taken to the ER at BGH.  Her chief complaint was of chest pain followed by abdominal pain.   She did not report neck pain, headache, loss of consciousness or nausea/vomiting. Initial chest x- ray indicated cardiomegaly and possible mediastinal widening.  

Same day CT torso confirmed mild cardiomegaly and ruled out mediastinal hematoma.   No rib fractures or dislocations were indicated. There was a tiny right sided pleural effusion.  CT of the cervical spine and abdomen did not indicate any acute posttraumatic abnormalities.   EKG indicated sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs.  Blood pressure was elevated to 226/143 at 76 bpm.   Glucose was 135.   CBC, CMP and coagulation studies were within normal limits.    Amylase and lipase were within normal limits.  eGFR was >60.   

Follow up with her primary care and consulted cardiologist detected persistently elevated blood pressure above her baseline elevation and required upward titration of metoprolol and Lisinopril on two separate occasions due to lack of control of systolic blood pressure in the 170‚Äôs.  Currently, per patient, it is now under control.  

At this visit she also noted persistent bilateral neck, right shoulder, and mid back pain as well as bilateral pain and paresthesia in her upper extremities.  This pain has prevented her from carrying out her duties as an administrative assistant, which involves work at a computer station.  She is currently on a leave of absence from her job and hopes to return to work soon.  

She was referred to a neurosurgeon who ordered cervical and thoracic MRI‚Äôs which detected an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm as an incidental finding.  The studies were conducted on 11/23/15 approximately one month after the accident.

An investigation of persistent mid back, shoulder, hand and wrist pain led to MRIs of the thoracic and cervical spine on 11/23/15 one month after the accident.   They did not indicate any vertebral fractures, dislocations, spinal cord or nerve root compression.  There was evidence of an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm with a maximum dimension of 3.9 cm.   As outlined in the topic, ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm is one possible sequela of rapid deceleration injuries and the water hammer effect like those experienced during airbag deployment during an MVA.  The patient is a lifetime nonsmoker, which is a significant risk factor and she does not have apparent connective tissue disease or a family history of such disorders. 
Temporal considerations:    The visual evidence is indisputable, yet the etiology is less certain and most likely multifactorial.  Chronic hypertension and hyperlipidemia can weaken vessel walls creating a predisposition to vascular injury secondary to acute deceleration and chest wall trauma.   The initial chest CT on the day of the accident did not detect an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm indicating recent (post-accident) development.    The chest x-ray was indicative of borderline mediastinal widening.  There are no cross sectional chest images prior to the accident for comparison of the aortic diameter.    The fact that there were and currently are no compressive symptoms such as dyspnea, dysphagia or hoarseness is not helpful in elucidating the etiology since most thoracic aortic aneurysms are asymptomatic.   Considering the mild cardiomegaly was present at the time of the accident it is unlikely that the aneurysmal dilation, if acquired at the time of the accident contributed to the cardiomegaly.  This is important because thoracic aortic aneurysms can contribute to the development of heart failure.   The sharply elevated blood pressure discovered after the accident may be due to emotional stress due to the patient‚Äôs pain symptoms and uncertainty about her ability to return to work.  Irrespective of the cause, this elevated blood pressure most likely contributed to development and/or worsening of the aneurysm and needs to be monitored closely to avoid rupture.
