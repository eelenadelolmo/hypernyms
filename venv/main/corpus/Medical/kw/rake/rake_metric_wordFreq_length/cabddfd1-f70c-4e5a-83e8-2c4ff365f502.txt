Pertinant Positives: Subtle Left Facial Droop
The initial treatment of choice for Glioblastoma Multiforme is surgical resection with maximal preservation of neurological function. However, few if any patients are cured with surgery alone. Therefore, adjuvant focal external beam radiation therapy along with chemotherapy is usually added. The median survival rate with supportive care is 14wks, 20wks with resectionn alone, 36wks for surgery with radiation therapy, and 40-50wks with the addition of chemotherapy.

Patient with history of hypertension, osteoarthritis and hyperlipidemia presents with one month history of gait disturbance, requiring cane. Progresses to Left facial droop and Left lower extremity weakness.
Glioblastoma Multiformes are CNS neoplasms derived from immortalized astrocytes. They occur in all ages with peak at 65-75 years of age. The are more common in men (men > women 3:2), and more common in whites. The most common presenting symptom is headache, followed by memory loss, motor weakness, visual symptoms, language deficit, and cognitive/personality changes.
