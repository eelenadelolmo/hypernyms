Dr. Mullins, please add some information here.  The patient is likely to have had a pneumothorax appreciable on physical exam at the time of presentation.  Vital signs should be included.  any extremity injuries should be discussed. I notice the axillary arteries to be of different calibers, with the left being smaller than the right.  This can be seen with spasm due to peripheral vascular injury.  Peripheral pulses should be discussed.  

Also look at the ER note for any other findings.
Consideration was given to coil embolization, but the neck was deemed too wide.  Nonoperative treatment is currently being used.  Surgical vs. stentgraft will be made is there is rupture or change in size.

If conservative management was chosen, a follow up scan should be performed to look for necrotic lung.
Contrast enhanced axial CT images with oblique sagittal reconstructions and 3D modeling demonstrate a bilobed outpouching of contrast at the posterior aspect of the left pulmonary artery contained by mediastinal hematoma.
Pulmonary Artery Pseudaneurysm
Pulmonary artery laceration
pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm
pulmonary artery aneurysm
Nidus of AV fistula
Draining vein antiparallel to the artery
A 45 year man presents to the emergency room after major trauma.  The patient was riding a motorcycle when he was struck by a car.
This finding may have be incidental.  Injury to vessels due to blunt trauma are usually at sites where a vessel is relatively fixed, such as at the inferior surface of the isthmus of the aorta, near the ligamentum arteriosum.
