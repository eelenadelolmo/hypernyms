Treatment/Management: No known effective cure/treatment. Steroids have not been proven to change course of disease once fibrosis has begun. Stopping smoking may slow progression. Neurofibromatosis 1 has soft tissue neoplastic tendencies that should be monitored periodically for interval changes if there is suspicision for malignancy or if the patient is symptomatic.
CXR: Ill-defined density in upper lateral peri-hilar region on PA view, not definitively seen on lateral projection, but possibly more anterior.

CT, chest w/contrast: Multiple soft tissue attenuated skin nodules noted on anterior chest. No pulmonary nodules or masses seen.  Pulmonary fibrosis with honey-combing predominately occurring in the upper lobes. Bullous changes are seen adjacent to mediastinum near azygoesophageal recess. Pulmonary scaring and honey-combing extends to right lower lung.
Pulmonary manifestations of Neurofibromatosis 1. However, pulmonary fibrosis with bullous formation from smoking related pulmonary diseases canâ€™t be ruled out.
Emphysema
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)
Autoimmune disorders (Sarcoidosis, RA)
Collagen-vascular diseases with fibrosising aveolitits
66 y.o. female with NF1, vomiting, 25 pack year smoking history, No history of COPD.  CXR obtained initially and Chest CT later obtained for further evaluation of CXR findings.
Dx:  Pulmonary fibrosis with bullous formation consistent with pulmonary manifestations of Neurofibromatosis 1, however, smoking related pulmonary diseases canâ€™t be ruled out.

Disease Discussion:  Neurofibromatosis 1 (von Reckinghausenâ€™s disease, or NF1), is a autosomal dominant disorder involving Chromosome 17 of probable neural crest origin affecting all 3 germinal layers.  Considered the most common neurocutanous disorder, both neuroectodermal and mesenchymal derivatives.  Typically NF1 is recognized on clinical exam (85% of patients) with cutanous neurofibromas.  NF1 can manifest in any organ in the body. Projection of neurofibromas over the thorax on frontal and lateral radiographs may be misinterpreted as a pulmonary nodule (as demonstrated on above CXR), so it is important to use CT to help differentiate.

Pulmonary involvement occurs in 10-20% of all NF1 patients. Occurring usually not until adult hood. The lung parenchyma can progress to developing interstitial fibrosis with associated severe thin-walled bullous formations reported to typically occur in the upper lobes and apical segments of the lower lobes bilaterally and symmetrically. Honey-combing, also described as subpleural small-blister-like changes, is reportedly seen in the bibasilar regions of the lungs.  These findings may be coincidental with other lung diseases, however, the noted mesenchymal abnormalities caused by NF1 may affect lung parenchyma.  The pathology of the lung parenchyma shows alveolar wall thickening progressing to fibrosis and lung destruction. Pulmonary function tests show either an obstructive or a restrictive process.
