Marked upper arm swelling and bruising
Soft Tissue swelling of the upper arm and "bucket handle" fracture of the distal humerus consistent with characteristic metaphyseal lesion.
Classic Metaphyseal Lesion- Accidental Trauma
Non-Accidental Trauma
8 month old infant presents with upper arm swelling, after care-giver tripped coming down the stairs, dropped the infant, and then grabbed him by the upper arm to prevent fall.
In this patient's case, the history matched the injury findings, and the mechanism of injury, although accidental, was identical to the twisting force of non-accidental trauma.  No other injuries were discovered, and investigation concluded that this was an accidental injury.
