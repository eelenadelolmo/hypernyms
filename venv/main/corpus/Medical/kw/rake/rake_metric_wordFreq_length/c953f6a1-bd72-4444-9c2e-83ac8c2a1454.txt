Non-contributory.
Large mass in the right upper lobe with invasion of the pleura. 

On PET, the lesion in the lung is very hot with SUVs of 11.0 initially that increase to 14.0 on the delayed images.  The central photopenic region corresponds to necrosis which can be seen on the CT as a hypodense center.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Based on the chest x-ray findings:
- benign neoplasm
- malignant neoplasm
- hamartoma
- granuloma (inflammatory or infectious)
- AVM (unlikely in this case given the size)
Cough with one episode of minimal hemoptysis.
The patient recieved a PET scan because research has shown that PET will more accurately stage a lung cancer than a CT.  PET/CT is even more accurate than either modality alone.

In this case, given no distant metastatic lesions and no contralateral hilar lymph nodes seen on PET, the lesion remained at a IIIA stage which is a resectable lesion although the prognosis is poor, 10-35% estimated 5 year survival.
