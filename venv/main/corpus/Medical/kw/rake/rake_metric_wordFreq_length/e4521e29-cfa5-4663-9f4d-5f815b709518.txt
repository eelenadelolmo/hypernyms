1.)  AP Knee: Chondrocalcinosis demonstrated by wedge shaped calcification seen in the fibrocartilaginous menisci and curvilinear calcification of the hyaline cartilage seen best on the medial aspect of lateral femoral condyle. Calcification of the cruciate ligaments is also appreciated. The medial and lateral tibio-femoral joint spaces remain preserved.

2.) Lateral Knee: The femoro-patellar joint space is preserved with minimal subchondral sclerosis. Curvilinear calcification in the hyaline cartilage of the medial and lateral femoral condyles and  the calcified menisci are also seen.

3.) Left Hip: Uniform narrowing of joint space with axial migration of femoral head. Numerous subchondral cysts.Mild degenerative change with osteophyte formation
4.) Right Hip: Joint space preserved. Calcinosis of femoral hyaline cartilage. Sclerotic changes in acetabulum.
Calcium Pyrophosphate Dihydrate Crystal Deposition Disease (CPPD) (Pseudogout)
1.) Cation disease
2.) Crystal Deposition Disease
3.) Cartilage degeneration from unknown cause.
61yo Caucasian male with 4-5 year history of intermittent acute episodes of swollen, red, painful knees and left hip. Episodes of pain last 1-2 weeks and are usually relieved with NSAIDs.
CPPD may produce the clinical symtoms and findings of pseudogout and occurs usually in persons  over age 50 with no gender preference. Some studies show its prevalence to 3-5% of the adult population as demonstrated by calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposits in the knee joint making it the most common crystal arthropathy. However, it is estimated that there is only one symptomatic patient for every 2-3 patients with gouty arthritis.

When chondrocalcinosis is identified the differential diagnosis is relatively short. It is essentially the 3 C's 1) Cation disease, 2) Crystal Deposition Disease, 3) Cartilage degeneration from unknown cause.

Cation Diseases includes 1) Hyperparathyroidism, 2) Hemochromatosis, 3) Wilson's Disease. Approximately 30-50% of patients with Hyperparathyroidism or Hemochromatosis have arthropathy secondary to calcium pyrophosphate deposits. It is thought that high concentrations of these ions inhibits the normal hydrolysis of calcium pyrophosphate leading to crystal formation and deposition. Wilson's disease is rare and the neurologic symptoms far outweigh the joint manifestations but it is associated with chondrocalcinosis.
Crystal Deposition disease included gout (sodium monourate) or Pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate) crystals in the joint space. The crystals are irritating and clinically both of these diseases can present similarly. Identifying an associated effusion and chondrocalcinosis makes CPPD more likely. Examination of the synovial fluid confirms the diagnosis. Under polarized light the calcium pyrophosphate crystals are short blunt rods rhomboids and cuboids and have weakly positive birefringence. The sodium urate crystals are needle shaped and show strongly negative birefringence. CPPD most commonly affects the knee, wrist pubic symphysis. In a patient with CPPD at least one of these areas will be affected. A presumptive radiologic diagnosis may be made if two or more skeletal areas show chondrocalcinosis.

The other forms of cartilage degeneration are often associated with calcium hydroxyapatite. These crystals are deposited in the tendons and joint soft tissues. It is associated with unusually high levels of collagenase.
Ochronosis is another disease associated with calcium hydroxyapatite. The cartilage destruction comes from the underlying metabolic disorder absent homogentisic acid oxidase. This excess homogentisic acid is deposited in the cartilage. It is associated with osteoporosis, multiple level disc degeneration, loss of joint space, and intra-articular loose bodies. The spine is most frequently affected.
