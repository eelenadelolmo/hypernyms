MRI revealed multiple ring-enhancing lesions throughout the brain bilaterally.
Multifocal brain abscess
Hematogenous (most likely) vs contagenous spread.  Etiology due to TB, opportunistic infections, neurocysticercosis, cryptococcosis, metastasis, multiple sclerosis, IV drug use, sinusitis, dental infection, endocarditis, pulmonary infection, abdominal infection.
