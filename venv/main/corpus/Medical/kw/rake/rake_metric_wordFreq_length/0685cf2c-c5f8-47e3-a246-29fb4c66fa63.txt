Texto: 
Neck pain elicited with full flexion of neck.  Neuro exam intact, alert and oriented, rest of exam within normal limits.  Blood and CSF cultures negative.  CSF analysis RBC 38 WBC 218 98% segs gluc 27 protein 68.  Abscess culture with scant growth of Streptococcus intermedius.
Initially treated empirically with parenteral Rocephin and Vancomycin.  Rocephin was changed to Merrem.  Treatment will be continued for 4 to 6 weeks.  Follow-up MRI 3 weeks after discharge from hospital.
Initial CT head with and without contrast revealed multiple ring-enhancing lesions scattered throughout the supratentorial brain.  

MRI revealed multiple ring-enhancing lesions throughout the brain bilaterally.
Multifocal brain abscess
Hematogenous (most likely) vs contagenous spread.  Etiology due to TB, opportunistic infections, neurocysticercosis, cryptococcosis, metastasis, multiple sclerosis, IV drug use, sinusitis, dental infection, endocarditis, pulmonary infection, abdominal infection.
17 y/o man with fevers to 42.4 degrees Celsius and headache s/p 7 days of parenteral antibiotics for meningitis worsening clinically.
The patient began responding to parenteral antibiotics.  He was later discharged home on antibiotics with follow-up MRI in 3 weeks.
