Soft tissue swelling about the knee with possible joint effusion.
The patient was initially treated conservatively with 12 months of rest and rehabilitation.  Arthroscopy will be consider after 12 months if no appreciable healing is identified.  Treatment options would include antegrade or retrograde drilling in an effort to stimulate healing.
Plain Films and MRI revealed a 1.6cm oseous irregularity along the lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle.  A loose fragment was suspected on plain films.  The MR revealed fluid signal intensity surrounding the fragment without displacement of the fragment.
