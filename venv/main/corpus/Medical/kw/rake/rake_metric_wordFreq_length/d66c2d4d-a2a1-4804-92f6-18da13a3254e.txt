Physical exam reveal a protuberant abdomen with decreased bowel sounds.
Removal of source of possible tumor origin required bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy. Surgical debulking (performed on a number of occasions) of mucinous ascities was performed for relief of symptoms. The patient has also received multiple rounds of chemotherapy with Taxol/Carboplatin.
An acute abdominal series suggest early small bowel obstruction, with a dilated loop of small bowel and paucity of large bowel gas. The abdomen is protuberant, with centralization of bowel loops suggesting ascites. This is best demonstrated on follow up CT Scanogram obtained at a latter date.

CT images demonstrate ascites that causes mass effect on abdominal viscera, demostrated by scalloping of the liver margins.

28 y.o. woman with onset of crampy abdominal pain.
Her diagnosis was confirmed by CT imaging and pathologic examination after the surgical debulking, hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy.  Pseudomyxoma peritonei is a complication of intraperitoneal seeding of mucinous producing cells from a number of neoplastic processes, leading to mucinous ascites.  The majority of true examples (diffuse form) are due to appendiceal mucoceles from mucinous adenocarcinoma.  Mucinous neoplasms of the ovary and colon can give a similar appreance. Some suggest that even some suspected ovarian sources originated from the appendix, with secondary spread to both the ovaries and peritoneum.

Seeding may occur from rupture of the primary tumor, or from accidental rupture during surgical exploration and/or excision.  The majority (~95%) of the peritoneal material is acellular mucin, which is produced by the neoplastic cells implanted within the peritoneal cavity. 

Findings on CT include loculated ascites with scalloping of the abdominal organs and septations - with or without calcification. The Peritoneal surface may also contain punctate calcifications. The mucinous ascities is usually loculated, and a key finding is mass effect on the solid viscera, such as scalloping of the liver and displacement of hollow viscera (bowel). This is in contrast to typical non-neoplastic ascites, which will surround organs, but may not alter their normal contours.

Although the primary process may be benign or malignant, some authorities believe the unrelenting diffuse form is only from malignant disease.

Treatment often consists of removal of the primary tumor, omentectomy, and debulking of the mucoid material but recurrences are common. There is progressive distention of the peritoneum and compression of abdominal viscera. Repeated surgical debridement of mucoid material from the abdomen carries the risks of surgical complications, which is often the eventual cause of death. Patients also often experience progressive wasting, and can suffer from repeated bowel obstruction.
