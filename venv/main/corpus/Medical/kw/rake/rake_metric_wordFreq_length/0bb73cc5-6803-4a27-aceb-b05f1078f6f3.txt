Sagittal T1-weighted images demonstrate a hypointense region involving the inferior aspect of the right cerebellum.  T2-weighted images show hyperintense signal involving the right cerebellum with extension into the right medulla.  Diffusion-weighted imaging shows high signal consistent with restricted diffusion in the area of T2 hyperintensity.  This is confirmed on ADC mapping images.
