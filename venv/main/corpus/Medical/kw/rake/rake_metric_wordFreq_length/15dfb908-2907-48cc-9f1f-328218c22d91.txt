Texto: 
Normal breast exam.  No palpable masses, skin thickening, nipple retraction or nipple discharge.
No treatment neccessary.  Just continued annual screening mammograms and monthly self breast exams.
MLO views of both breasts demonstrate bilateral, right greater than left, coarse linear calcifications seen within mostly dilated ducts.  They are larger than 0.5 mm in thickness and do not branch.
Close up (not specefic magnification views)of the MLO demonstrate the benign characteristics of these calcifications to better advantage.
Secretory Calcifications of the Breast
No differential given appearance.
65 y/o woman who is asymptomatic in regards to the breast, is due for annual screening mammogram.
