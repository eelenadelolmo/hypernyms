Pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding during 6th week of pregnancy with 11000 quantitative HCG.
When evaluating intrauterine pregnancies of early first trimester, it is critical to remember size criteria for appearance of normal structures.  The expectations for being able to see internal structures in the gestational sac are based on mean gestational sac sizes.  At a Mean Sac Diameter (MSD) of 10mm a yolk sac (thin walled ring structure of <6mm) must be present.  By 16mm MSD, a fetal pole must be present.  If these discriminating features are not present, the pregnancy is abnormal.  The differential involves the items listed above.  A careful search for an adenexal mass and close attention to free fluid, secondary indicators that increase concern for an ectopic, should be sought.
