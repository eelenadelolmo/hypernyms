In the above patient, who additionally has renal failure and heart failure, the decision was made to manage the condition medically (with intravenous antibiotics) rather than surgically.  In addition to following serum markers for infection (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate), the PET scan was performed to “quantify” the intensity of involvement, with planned repeat scan 3 weeks following antibiotics to assess response.
CT: June 15 -- 4.2 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm noted.
July  18 – (image at same level as above). AAA now measures 4.9 cm and has surrounding, diffuse inflammatory fat stranding, with partial indistinctness of the aortic wall.

Indium-111 WBC scan –	Twenty-fours hours after IV injection of autologous WBCs, whole body planar images were performed.  Intense fusiform radiotracer uptake is present in the region of the abdominal aorta.  Findings were confirmed with Hawkeye camera (CT / SPECT fusion).  
  
PET Imaging-	After injection with F-18 Flourodeoxyglucose, images show intense increased F-18 FDG metabolism in the region of the infrarenal abdominal aorta in a ring-like configuration (SUV approx. 9), with additional region of increased metabolism (SUV approx 4) in region of sigmoid, representing either extension of infection, post-surgical change or residual/recurrent tumor.
Mycotic Aneurysm
mycotic aneurysm, inflammatory aneurysm, leaking aneurysm
Status post sigmoid resection (for carcinoma) in early June 2003. Discharged from hospital but readmitted 15 June for mental status change and intermittent fevers.  Imaging unremarkable for contributory etiology at that time.  Patient improved, was discharged, but re-admitted approx. 15 July with similar symptoms and sepsis, with 4/4 blood cultures positive for Staph. aureus sepsis.
Based on CT appearance:  mycotic aneurysm, inflammatory aneurysm, leaking aneurysm.   Combined with the In-111 WBC Scan, and with the patient’s know history of sepsis, it is highly suspicious for mycotic aneurysm.  Leaking aneurysm would likely be more associated with retroperitoneal hemorrhage and possibly decrease in Hb/Hct, neither of which were present.  Inflammatory aneurysm is usually associated with a mantle of perianeurysmal fibrosis.
