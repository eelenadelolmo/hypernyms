Texto: 
Physical exam, including CN I-XII, within normal limits. CSF positive for two oligoclonal bands.
Patient admitted and recieved solumedrol x 5 days.  Then discharged to home with followup in three months after repeat MRI brain and C-spine.  In the event of an another episode, immunomodulating therapy to be initiated.
The cervical spine demonstrates T2 hyperintensity within the cord at C3 and C4 with mild expansion of the cord. 

Enhancement in the right side of the brain and enhancement adjacent to the posterior horn of the left lateral ventricle are well visualized on axial T1 post gadolinium MRI.



These high signal lesions are consistent with demylination.
Multiple Sclerosis
â€¢ CNS infection (Lyme disease, syphilis, HIV infection, human T-lymphotrophic virus type I)

â€¢ CNS inflammatory condition (sarcoidosis, SLE, Sj?gren's syndrome)

â€¢ CNS microvascular disease (HTN, DM, vasculitis)

â€¢ Genetic disorder (leukodystrophy, hereditary myelopathy, mitochondrial disease)

â€¢ Structural or compressive condition of the brain and spinal cord

â€¢ Vitamin B12 deficiency

â€¢ Multiple sclerosis
21 y.o. woman with 5-7d h/o cervical neck pain associated intermittent shooting and tingling pains in both arms (L>R).  
Negative Medical history, Family history, or Social History.  No medications.
Physical symptoms, MRI findings, and positive CSF oligoclonal bands are strongly indicative multiple sclerosis.  The presence of CNS lesions that are disseminated in time and space with no better explanation for the disease process will confirm the diagnosis.
