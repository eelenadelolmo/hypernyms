1 Ophthalmic examination was normal.
2. Blood urea / sugar - normal
3. Peripheral blood smear - normal
4. X ray chest - normal
5. CT brain - normal
6. CT para nasal sinuses - Huge concha of middle turbinate on the right side
Conchaplasty was performed following which patient had immediate relief from head ache.
1. Huge concha bullosa of middle turbinate on the right side.
2. The concha was so huge that it fills the whole of right nasal cavity.
3. It even partially obliterates the right maxillary sinus cavity.
4. There was no evidence of inflammatory changes in the nasal or sinus mucosa.
Large concha bullosa (Middle turbinate syndrome)
Large concha bullosa
20 y.o. woman with headache involving the right side.  It was more retro orbital in nature - 3 years.  Headache was present throughout the day.  Patient had periods of remission during these 3 years.  Patient invariably felt better after a good sleep.
Headache was not associated with vomiting.  Patient gave no h/o head injury or seizures.  She also gave no h/o nasal block / discharge.
Concha bullosa can cause head ache by obstructing the drainage of anterior group of sinuses.  In this patient there was no radiological evidence of inflammation.  Probably headache in this patient could have been caused by stretching of infraorbital / anterior ethmoidal nerves.
