Quadraplegia
Placement of a IVC filter.
Ultrasound examination of the right lower extremity demonstrates a linear intraluminal echogenic area located in the common femoral vein. No acoustic shadowing deep to the area. These findings are suggestive of a small non- occlusive thrombus of indeterminate age.
Non occlusive Deep Venous Thrombus of the Common Femoral Vein
Intraluminal fibrin strand from prior line placement
Phlebitis
Venous valve thickening
20 year old Active duty male presented with a comminuted fracture involving the C3 lamina as well as nondisplaced fracture of the spinous process of C4 that led to quadriplegia.  The injury occurred weeks prior to this ultrasound.  The study was performed as part of routine evaluation.
