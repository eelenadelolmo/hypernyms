Dilation procedure during endoscopy.
Fluoroscopic images demonstrate in the prone position during barium swallowing a focal stricture above the GE junction that is approximately 3 mm in height. Supine images demonstrate similar findings. Following ingestion of a 12.5 mm barium tablet, there is obstruction, indicating the interior diameter of the lumen of the stricture is less than 12.5 mm.
