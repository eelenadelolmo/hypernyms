Texto: 
Patient reported headache initially.  Patient also suffered fractured tibia/fibula in MVA (not shown).


In six month follow-up visit, anosmia is confirmed.  Sense of taste intact.  No reported personality changes.
No specific treatment planned.
The original CT exam taken 3 days after the MVA shows frontal contusions bilaterally, paramedian in location.  There is a small amount of acute blood medially.  In addition, another area of midline contusion is seen overlying the olfactory bulb, involving the bilateral olfactory gyri.

On the MRI exam obtained six months later, the images demonstrate encephalomalacia in the areas of previous contusion/hemorrhage.
