Trans-sphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma. 6 month post-op MRI showed empty sella with trace residual pituitary parenchyma along the lateral margins. 6 month postop visual field testing showed complete return of visual fields and left eye, but residual temporal hemianopsia of the right eye with minimal return of central vision on the right.
As clinically suspected, there is a large suprasellar mass which 	
    measures approximately 39 mm CC x 24 mm TR x 23 mm AP. 50% of the mass is 	
    suprasellar and 50% is within the sella. As such, the mass shape is somewhat 	
    dumbbell in morphology. The sella appears expanded. The mass signal intensity is	
    mixed with multiple globular sites of T2 and T1 hyperintensity measuring on the 	
    order of 8 mm interposed with solid appearing, isointense to brain parenchyma 	
    tissue mostly compatible with areas of cystic degeneration with or without some 	
    degree of hemorrhage. There is superior mass effect upon the optic chiasm. 		
    In other regards, the brainstem, cerebellum, and cerebral hemispheres are 	
    otherwise normal in morphology without evidence of other abnormal enhancement, 	
    other mass lesion, hemorrhage, midline shift, or ischemia. Gray-white matter 	
    differentiation is appropriate. Specifically, no abnormal T2 or FLAIR signal 	
    alteration is present and no restricted diffusion is identified. 		
    The ventricles, basal cisterns, and sulci are appropriate volume for the 	
    patient's age. No abnormal extra-axial fluid or mass lesion is present. 		
    The orbital contents are unremarkable. No discrete middle ear abnormality is 	
    appreciated. 		
    The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. The remainder 	
    of the visualized soft tissues and osseous structures are normal. 		
    IMPRESSION: Findings essentially diagnostic large 4 cm pituitary macroadenoma.
Pituitary Macroadenoma
Pituitary macroadenoma, pituitary carcinoma, meningioma, craniopharyngioma, lymphocytic hypophysitis
23 yo man presented to the clinic for required annual physical.  Patient had obvious visual field defects in the lateral fields.  Visual field mapping was then done with optometry the same day which showed bitemporal hemianopsia.
Pituitary macroadenomas are benign epithelial neoplasms composed of adenohypophysial cells and account for 10-15% of all intracranial tumors. Tumors exceeding 10 mm are defined as macroadenomas, and those smaller than 10 mm are termed microadenomas. Most pituitary adenomas are microadenomas.  Morbidity  varies from incidentally discovered nonfunctioning tumors to disabling macroadenomas. Morbidity results from mass effect, hormonal imbalance, and patient comorbidities. Women of childbearing age are diagnosed more frequently with pituitary adenomas as compared to men, possibly due to presenting complaint of amenorrhea. Incidence increases with age, peaking between the third and sixth decades. Patients with pituitary macroadenomas may be asymptomatic or may present with complaints due to hormonal imbalance or mass effects, such as visual deficits, headache, elevated intracranial pressure, or intracranial hemorrhage
