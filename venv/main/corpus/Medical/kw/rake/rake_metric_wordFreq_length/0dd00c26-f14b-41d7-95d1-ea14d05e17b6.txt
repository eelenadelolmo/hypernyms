Horseshoe kidney
24 y.o. with four days of right lower quadrant abdominal pain and minimal periotoneal findings. Previous Hx of right lower quadrant pain for several months.
Patient’s symptoms were vague and the clinician initially considered gastrointestinal pathology (e.g. appendicitis). 

Radiology noted the unusual vertical orientation of the long axis of both kidneys, suggesting a horseshoe kidney. Normally, the axis of the kidneys is roughly parallel to the psoas muscle, and *point* to the T10 vertebral body.

A CT was ordered by the clinician who still suspected gastrointestinal disease.  Confirmation of the horseshoe kidney by CT - that also demonstrated nephrolithiasis, a common complication associated with horseshoe kidneys.

The soft tissue isthmus that connects the kidneys across the midline, consists of fibrous material or renal parenchyma.

Embryologically, the isthmus is an impediment to normal rotation and ascent of the renal anlage, as it reaches the inferior mesenteric artery - as in this case.

The renal vascular supply is typically anomalous.  Rotational anomalies and the unusual anterior course of the ureters result in varying degrees of obstruction giving rise to urinary stasis, infection, and stones.

Other associated anomalies of the gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal and respiratory tract can occur.
