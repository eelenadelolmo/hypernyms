General: Well developed female in no acute distress.
VS: Stable
HEENT: unremarkable.
Chest: Scar in left breast.  Lungs demonstrated slight wheezing in lower lung zones bilaterally.
Heart: RRR. nml S1 and S2.
Abdomen: Normal bowel sounds.  Non-tender.  No masses palpated.
Rectal: No mass, guaiac negative.
Extremities: unremarkable.
Diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates, predominantly in lower lung zones bilaterally on PA projection.

CT demonstrates classic peri-lymphatic distribution of disease, desmoplastic reaction, intersitial edema, and dilated lymphatics involving the bronchovascular bundles, thickening of the fissures and interlobular septa.  Also small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
Lymphangitic Carcinomatosis from Primary Breast Adenocarcinoma
1. Lymphoma
2. Sarcoidosis
3. Lymphangitic spread of neoplasm (metastatic or primary)
33 y/o Caucasian woman with 2 week history of progressive cough, fever, and night sweats.

Past Medical History:
Left lumpectomy and axillary exploration for ductal adenocarcinoma.
The differential diagnosis includes sarcoidosis and lymphoma that like lymphangitic carcinomatosis, can predominantly involve the pulmonary lymphatics.  However in a study by Honda et al(2), the major difference among the three diseases is that lymphangitic carcinomatosis involves the interlobular septa and subpleural interstitium (fissures) to a greater extent than either sarcoidosis or lymphoma.  Also they reported that in malignant lymphoma, large nodules (>1cm) were more often seen.  Further sarcoidosis was more involved in bilateral lungs.  

In our case, the patient already had a history of a primary neoplasm well known to produce lymphangitic carcinomatosis (breast cancer - adenocarcinoma).  The lack of large nodules (>1cm) also argues against malignant lymphoma.  Furthermore, the hilar and right paratracheal nodes lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged by size criteria.  Hence sarcoidosis was unlikely - especially because she also has small bilateral pleural effusions, a rare finding in pulmonary sarcoid.  All things considered, the best fit for her diagnosis is lymphangitic carcinomatosis from metastatic breast cancer.
