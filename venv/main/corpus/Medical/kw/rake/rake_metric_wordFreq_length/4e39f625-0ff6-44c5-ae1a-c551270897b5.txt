Following injection of Tc-99m DTPA, cortical-phase images reveal a photopenic space-occupying lesion involving approximately one-half the diameter of the upper pole of the left kidney.  Additionally, two separate collections of tracer are visualized within the right kidney.  Select CT images at the level of the kidneys demonstrate bilateral duplicated renal collecting systems with massive dilation of the left superior moiety ureter, indicating likely obstruction.
