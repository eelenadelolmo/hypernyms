Patient has had close clinical and laboratory follow to evaluate for complications.  Patient is scheduled in June for Follow up MR to evaluate for tumor response (decrease size and/or enhancement pattern).
Depending upon the response, she may have the left lobe lesion treated.
CT ABDOMEN 05 APR 2004:  Liver demonstrates a nodular contour consistent with chronic cirrhosis.  There are areas of heterogeneous density, throughout the right lobe of the liver, without definitive circumscribed mass identified.  Hypertrophy of the caudate lobe.  The left lobe appears clear by CT. Small spenule is present. Atherosclerotic vascular calcification of the abdominal aorta without aneurysmal dilatation. Degenerative changes of the spine. 
 
MR Abdomen 10 APR 2004:  The liver is diffusely nodular consistent with cirrhosis.  Multiple hyperenhancing lesions seen throughout the right lobe of the liver which appear to conglomerate to a mass in the superior portion of right lobe measuring approximately 13 X 10 cm.  A separate conglomeration mass is seen in the inferior portion of right lobe near the tip measuring approximately 7 X 7 cm.   Additionally there is a hyperenhancing mass measuring approximately 3 X 2 cm in the Left lobe of the liver not seen on the CT.

Angiography and Chemoembolization 16 APR 2004:  The injection of the right hepatic artery initially shows two areas in the right lobe (superior and inferior) of the liver with increased arterial size, neovascualrity, tumor staining and puddling of contrast material.  On a subsequent injection (image from later in the run), there is early opacification of a portal vein branch in the area indicating a fistulous communication with the proximal right hepatic artery (also notice the increasing tumor stain and puddling on this later injection).   Subselected injection of the inferior branch of the right hepatic artery.  Image taken during the infusion of the Chemotherapeutic-Ethiodol-Contrast mixture into that lower liver lesion.  Notice the dense material present in the upper liver lesion, representing Chemotherapeutic-Ethiodol-Contrast mixture from the prior infusion of that upper lesion.  (Due to technical malfunction, images of that infusion were unavailable)  The Gelfoam embolization images were not included.

Non contrast CT (post procedure) 16 APR 2004:   Immediately post Chemoembolization  this non-contrast CT shows hyperedense material (Ethiodol-Chemotherapuetic- Contrast mixture and Gelfoam-Contrast mixture) within two masses in the right lobe of the liver.
Hepatic Artery Chemoembolization of HCC.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
Metastatic disease.
59 year old African American Female referred to the Interventional Radiology department for palliative Chemoembolization of a Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
This 59 year old African American female has had Hepatitis C infection since 2001.  Follow up alpha-Fetoprotein levels became elevated in Febuary 2004, after being stable for years.  CT showed heterogeneous density, without obvious mass, in the right lobe of the liver. (Although it was not three phase liver protocol, only standard CT with contrast).   MR evaluation demonstated multifocal hyperenhancing lesions in the right lobe of the liver, in the region of heterogeneity on CT scan.  Additionally, a hyperenhancing lesion was seen in the left lobe, that was not appretiated on the CT (even in retrospect not visible).  Because of the multifocal nature she is a not a surgical candidate for either resection or transplant.  Radiation Oncology determined that because she was asymptomatic and her lesions were larger than 7 cm, none of their protocols were appropriate.  She was then referred to Interventional Radiology for Palliative treatment with Hepatic Artery Chemoembolization.
In this case, during the initial hepatic arteriogram, a small arterioportal fistula was identified in the proximal right hepatic artery.  This precluded the use of the standard protocol to infuse the Chemotherapy-Ethiodol mixture into this vessel (Do not want this mixture getting into the portal circulation)  Instead the superior and inferior branches of the right hepatic artery were selectively accessed and half the mixture was infused into each.  Then the catheter was withdrawn to embolize the entire right hepatic artery.  This was done to both, cut off blood supply to the liver tumors (per protocol) and attempt to close the aterioportal fistula.
