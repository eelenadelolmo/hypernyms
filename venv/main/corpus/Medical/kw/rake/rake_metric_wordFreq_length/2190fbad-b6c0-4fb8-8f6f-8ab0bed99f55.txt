24+5 week old female (day four of life) who is undergoing repeat head ultrasound screening after negative screening on day one of life.
Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is not an uncommon phenomenon in the premature infant.  With an incidence of 15% in neonates less than 1500 grams and less than 32 weeks, it is the most common intracranial abnormality in this subset of patients.  The incidence doubles (30%) when the infant is less than 28 weeks and less than 1000 grams.  The two factors leading to ICH in these premature infants are 1. instability of the cardiovascular system and 2. the absence of an autoregulatory mechanism.  The first factor leads to sudden fluctuations in systemic blood pressure, and without an autoregulatory system these fluctuations are transmitted directly to the vasculature within the brain.  

ICH tends to occur within the first 3 days of life.  Within 72 to 96 hours, 80% to 90% of ICH has occurred, and it is rare for ICH to occur after the first week.  The classification of Papile and colleagues is used to categorize the severity of ICH into four grades:
 Grade 1 hemorrhage is described as subependymal hemorrhage at the germinal matrix.  
 Grade 2 occurs when the germinal matrix ruptures through the ependymal wall and enters the lateral ventricle.  
 Grade 3 intraventricular hemorrhage causes dilatation of one or both lateral ventricular spaces, and in its severe form the ventricular cavity may be completely filled with blood.    
 Grade 4 hemorrhage is described as intraparenchymal hemorrhage with a highly echogenic focus with irregular margins in the parenchyma typically adjacent to the lateral ventricles.  

The above mentioned case would be classified as a grade 4 hemorrhage.  The hyperechoic focus in the right cerebellum is typical of an intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH).  The location of the hemorrhage is atypical given that the most common sites of IPH are in the frontal and parietal lobes.  IPH is usually associated with intraventricular hemorrhage and ventricular dilation; these aspects that are not found in this case.  An intracerebellar hemorrhage is thought to be caused by one or more of the following three processes: primary hemorrhage, venous infarct, and/or extension of a subarachnoid/intraventricular hemorrhage into the cerebellum.  

The prognosis for a grade 4 hemorrhage is related to the severity of parenchymal injury.  Major motor deficits will be present in 90% of premature infants with IPH, and greater than 70% will have diminished cognitive function.  More specific to intracerebellar hemorrhage is a high mortality rate in premature infants, and term infants with these lesions suffer with significant neurologic deficits.  Given the severe consequences of ICH, ultrasound screening protocols have been established for premature infants.  In the asymptomatic premature infant, a screening head ultrasound should be performed between the 7th and 14th days of life.  If no ICH is detected, then a repeat head ultrasound should be performed at term (36-40 weeks).  In the symptomatic premature infant, the timeframe for ultrasound screening must be individualized.
