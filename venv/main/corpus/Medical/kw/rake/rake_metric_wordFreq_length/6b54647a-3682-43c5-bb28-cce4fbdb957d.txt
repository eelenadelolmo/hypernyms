Surgical repair of the aorta
Transection of the posterior wall of the aorta at the level of the median arcuate ligament with associated thrombus and continuing extravasation into the retroperiteum causing secondary acute flow limiting stenoses of the celiac axis and the aorta itself.
Traumatic Aortic Injury
Traumatic aortic injury
Iatrogenic aortic injury
Aortic dissection
Mycotic aneurysm
Endoleak
28 y.o. man in a motor vehicle collision.
At the time of this study, the extravasation of contrast was Largely constrained, resulting in the formation of a pseudoaneurysm, not unlike an iatrogenic femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after a cardiac catheterization.

The defect in the wall of the aorta is too large in this patient to attempt trancutaneous treatment with thrombus injection.
