Ultrasound demonstrates peritoneal collection of material with somewhat regularly scattered echogenic foci in a markedly hypoechoic background distending the abdomen and surrounding the viscera.

CT demonstrates material of ~25 hounsfield units surrounding the viscera and creating a scalloped margin along the solid viscera (liver/spleen).  Minimal regions of enhancement are seen in this in the region of the greater omentum.  A dense calcification is seen in the right lower quadrant
Peritoneal carcinomatosis - likely appendiceal origin
Peritoneal carcinomatosis (pseudomyxoma peritonei) - 
    Benign vs Malignant
Abdominal mild discomfort for several months, primarily consisting of reflux symptoms.  Patient noticing increasing abdominal girth - pants are no longer buttoning.
