Abdominal distension, high residuals noted.
One of the infants received bowel rest and antibiotics and is doing well. The other infant went to surgery and had part of the ileum resected.  This child is also doing well.
Two different frontal radiographs demonstrate the "football sign," with free air outlining the falciform ligament.  Lateral radiograph also demonstrates free air.

Former 26 week premature child now at 10 days old with abdominal distention. Additional 28 week premature infant displayed with similar history.
As outlined in the factoid, NEC is often associated with premature infants.  Surgery is a treatment, although non-operative treatment can also be used in selected cases.
