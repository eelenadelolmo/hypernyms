No remarkable findings on physical exam at time of study; all within normal limits.
Repair of anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the left coronary sinus with unroofing of the coronary artery technique. Patient scheduled follow up with CT surgery clinic and was advised to return to hospital with concerns or worsening symptoms.
Anomalous origin and course of the RCA from the left sinus of Valsalva with an interarterial proximal course (between aorta and pulmonary outflow tract)
Possible intramural course of the proximal RCA
Normal segmental cardiac anatomy with normal left ventricular wall motion and systolic function
Anomalous Right Coronary Artery
Not applicable
Patient was a 12 year old hispanic boy who presented with nausea, chest pain, and syncope for 5 months prior to hospital visit. He underwent CT coronary angiography.  Patient had past medical history of symptoms related to his heart condition.
Anomalies of the right coronary artery are rare and it is even a rarer finding where the RCA has itâ€™s origin at the left coronary cusp.
