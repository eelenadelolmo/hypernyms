This patient has undergone bisphosphonate treatment.
Marked osteopenia noted on all radiographs. Significant bowing of tibia and fibula with muliple cortical irregularities compatible with prior fractures.  Wormian bones noted on occiptal aspect of skull.  Skull is also noted to be brachycephalic.

Dwarfism:
      Thanatophoric dwarfism
      Achondroplasia
