Texto: 
Palpable lump in right scrotum.
No metastatic disease was found; patient remains asymptomatic after right orchiectomy.
Ultrasound images demonstrate a normal-sized right testicle with multiple punctate nonshadowing echogenic foci (with occasional ring down artifact)
consistent with testicular microliths.  In the upper pole of the right testicle is an isoechoic mass which was new from a prior ultrasound and is worrisome for a germ cell tumor.
Testicular Microlithiasis
Testicular Microlithiasis with testicular tumor
50 yo male with history of undescended right testicle which was repaired in middle age; the patient had this ultrasound for a palpabale abnormality in the right scrotum.  The left testicle was normal on sonography.
Testicular microlithias is an uncommon condition ( prevalence 0.68% ) in which calcifications are present within the seminal vesicle tubules.  These calcifications can occur in normal as well as cryptorchid testes and have been reported in Klinefelter's syndrome, male pseudohermaphroditism and
testicular neoplasms.  Bilateral involvement may occur.

It is catagorized into limited (less than 5 microliths) and classic (at least 5 microliths) forms.  Initially felt to be a benign process, research has found an elevated risk for co-existing testicular tumors.  Ultrasound surveillance
may be necessary for these patients.
