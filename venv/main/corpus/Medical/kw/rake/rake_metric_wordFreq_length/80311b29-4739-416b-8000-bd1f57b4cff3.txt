Bilateral retroareolar nontender masses.
The patient was referred back to the surgeons in the breast care clinic for further management.  Surgical resection is an option however not a requirement for gynecomastia.

Ultrasound demonstrated a focal collection of dilated ducts in the bilateral retroareolar regions.
