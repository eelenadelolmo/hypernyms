N/A
Patient was subsequently taken to surgery for a hemicolectomy.
Upright view of the abdomen demonstrates an area of lucency in the left paravertebral area compatible with pneumoretroperitoneum.

CT:  Extraluminal air in the left paravertebral region is confirmed as pneumoretroperitoneum.

There is also dense aortic calcification.

A reservoir for a penile implant in the right lower quadrant is present.
Pneumoperitoneum
None
71 year old male with mucosal rent during colonoscopy, admitted for observation.
Iatrogenic pneumoperitoneum or pneumoretroperitoneum from endoscopic procedures can occur.  Vigilance in assessing for extraluminal air is important.  Visualization of structures such as the falciform ligament and outlines of retroperitoneal structures such as the psoas and kidneys, as well as extraluminal air and pneumatosis, are important signs of extraluminal air.
