Deferred
There was a referral for Nuclear Bone Scan and consult to medical oncologist at the time of addition of this case to the MedPIX database.
The first study indeed had no findings of acute cardiopulmonary disease. However, a brief survey of the periphery on th PA image proved to have evidence of a lytic osseous lesion.
The second study was remarkable for multiple lytic lesions in the appendicular skeleton.

Multiple myeloma
Initially this patient presented at 48 years old with a history of cough for 2 weeks. PA and lateral chest radiographs were taken and an impression of "No acute cardiopulmonary disease" was given. Then a year later the patient presented to her primary care provider with complaints of bone pain in her shoulders and arms. At this point, the patient was again referred for chest radiograph specifically to look for metastatic foci in the appendicular skeleton. In addition, her full history of undergoing a lumpectomy two years in the past was disclosed.
It is important to look at the whole chest radiograph. An incomplete survey resulted in missing the diagnosis of metastatic disease by a year. Even if the history given points in one direction, the radiologist needs to do a full assessment of the image.
