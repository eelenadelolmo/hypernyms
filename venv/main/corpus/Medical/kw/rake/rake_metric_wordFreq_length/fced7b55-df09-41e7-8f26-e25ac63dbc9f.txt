This is a 9 year old white male who presented at 8 years old to a new pediatrician for his well child check. At this time no abnormalities in growth or development were noted. He was a Tanner stage 1.
     One year later he returned for his 9 year old well child checkup. The physician noted that he had facial acne, a long jaw, and adult-like muscle definition and veins. He was noted to be at a Tanner stage 3. The patients mother denied any "laughing spells" or seizures.
     Laboratory data showed a testosterone level of 400 (>300 is an adult level). His cortisol was within normal limits.  A bone age was determined via x-ray and showed that he was at greater than 2 S.D. above the mean for his chronological age of 110 months.
Treatments today have been suboptimal.  Patients who have gelastic seizures have been given anti-convulsants without much success.  Frequently, the repeated seizures lead to cognitive deterioration.

Most experts believe that surgery is not helpful.
Impression:
- The pituitary gland is positioned within the sella turcica and demonstrates normal signal characteristics.

- The infundibulum is not thickened and enhances normally.

- A rounded 5mm soft tissue thickening is present along the tuber cinereum midway between the mamillary bodies and the infundibulum. This is isointense to brain tissue on all sequences and does not enhance with IV contrast.

- The ventricles are normal in size and configuration. No abnormal signal intensity within the hypothalamus is identified.
Hypothalamic Hamartoma
1. Hypothalamic hamartoma
2. Craniopharyngioma
3. Hypothalamic glioma
4. Ganglioglioma
9 year old white male with precocious puberty.
This child does not have gelastic ssizures. Some authors have  been successful using a long acting analog of LRH to control precocious puberty.
