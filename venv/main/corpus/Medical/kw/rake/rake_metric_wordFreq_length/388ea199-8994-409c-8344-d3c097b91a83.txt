Labs demonstrate an elevated Prolactin level.
Patient referred to neurosurgery for consultation.
Avidly enhancing suprasellar mass distinct from the pituitary measuring approximately 3.3 x 2.5 x 3.5 cm. The mass surrounds the left cavernous internal carotid artery extending into the&#8232; medial aspect of the right cavernous sinus. 

The tumor extends anteriorly to the left orbital apex.&#8232;  There is suprasellar and pontine cistern extension also coursing along the &#8232;posterior margin of the majority of the clivus. There is posterior extension&#8232; of the mass surrounding the left 5th cranial nerve involving Meckel's cave as&#8232; well as surrounding the cisternal portion of the 5th cranial nerve. The mass&#8232; extends to but not definitely within the left foramen ovale involving the&#8232; left foramen rotundum as well. The mass abuts the left margin of &#8232;the basilar artery and the left anterior margin of the mid brain. It extends &#8232;into the posterior-superior aspect of the sphenoid sinus as well.&#8232;&#8232;

A fluid intensity, non-enhancing structure is seen along the posterior margin&#8232; of the above described mass filling the superior pontine cistern with &#8232;extension into the left suprasellar cistern measuring 2.3x1.5x1.2 cm.
Parasellar Meningioma and arachnoid cyst
Meningioma with adjacent arachnoid cyst
Cystic Meningioma
Invasive pituitary adenoma
Metastasis
Schwannoma
42 y.o. woman with elevated prolactin. Please evaluate for&#8232; evidence of pituitary adenoma
Although a common lesion, meningiomas may present with unusual imaging features such as large meningeal cysts, ring enhancement, and various metaplastic changes.  The term "cystic meningioma" has been used to describe meningiomas with either intratumoral cavities or extratumoral arachnoid cysts.  It has been postulated that this is a result of tumor necrosis or by direct secretion of fluid by tumor cells.
