The patient has a long-standing history of abnormal facies.
Incidental finding.  No follow up indicated.
CT of the head shows an expansile, ground glass lesion with lytic areas involving the frontal, ethmoid and sphenoid bones.  No associated soft tissue mass is seen.
Fibrous Dysplasia
• Fibrous Dysplasia  
• Paget’s disease
70 y.o. woman with no significant past medical history.
Fibrous dysplasia of the skull is characterized by a "ground glass" appearance in an expansile bone. Common sites of involvement include the ribs, proximal femurs (Shepherd’s crook deformity) and calvarium. Three distinct patterns are noted including cystic (most active – 25%), pagetoid – 50%, and sclerotic (least active -25%).  

There are three major presentations:
monostotic (most common), 
polyostotic, 
McCune-Albright syndrome.  

Malignant transformation is possible into osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytomas.
