Multiplanar FSE T2WI (fetal MRI) shows several subependymal nodules in the left lateral ventricle with unilateral left ventriculomegaly.
Fetal Tuberous Sclerosis
Tuberous Sclerosis
38 y/o Caucasian woman pregnant with twins was evaluated with routine sonography that demonstrated a cardiac tumor in one of the twins.
The underlying brain lesions of tuberous sclerosis are subependymal nodules and cortical tubers.  The subependymal nodules are situated at the edges of the lateral ventricles.  On T2 weighted images, these subependymal nodules appear dark either because of magnetic susceptibility artifact from calcification and/or low concentration of mobile water.  The nodules stand out on T2 weighted images because they are adjacent to the bright signal of cerebrospinal fluid.   

To avoid confusing subependymal nodules with artifacts, some authors have advocated a criterion of observing these nodules on at least two scanning sequences in orthogonal planes and to cause a contour deformity of the ventricular wall.  Multiplicity of these lesions increases the likelihood of tuberous sclerosis as the cause of the lesions.  A normal prenatal MR however does not exclude the diagnosis of TS.  Furthermore, it is unclear how strongly CNS findings correlate with the subsequent neurodevelopmental outcome of the neonate.  Much research still needs to be done.
