Urine Values:
  Normetanephrine 24H: 406 ug/24hr  (53-310 ug/24hr)
  Metanephrine 24H:    594 ug/24hr  (95-475 ug/24hr)
Surgical resection is the standard curative modality. If the primary tumor is localized to the adrenal gland and is benign, then survival is that of the normal age-matched population. In patients with unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic disease long-term survival is possible. However, the overall 5-year survival is less than 50%. Pharmacologic treatment of the catecholamine excess is mandatory and surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy may provide palliative benefit.
Dose: 10.5 mCi Iodine-123 MIBG, IV.

Procedure: After pretreatment with SSKI solution to block uptake in the thyroid gland, radiotracer was injected.  24 hour delayed planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were obtained.

Findings:  The planar images demonstrated normal distribution of radiotracer activity and no uptake identified in the bilateral adrenal regions (not shown).  The SPECT images demonstrate in three orthogonal tomographic planes, focal uptake in the bilateral upper retroperitoneal/adrenal regions.  There are no other areas of abnormal radiotracer accumulation.
Bilateral Pheochromocytoma
Pheochromocytoma 
Neuroblastoma
Ganglioneuro(blasto)ma
(DDX for imaging findings only)
82 y/o white female with anxiety attacks and labile hypertension.   Laboratory values consistent with Pheochromocytoma.  Please evaluate with nuclear scintigraphy
