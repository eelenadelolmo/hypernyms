Physical examination: Patient has pain with ambulation. Knees  no pain to palpation, no nodules, no muscle weakness, no warmth to touch, no erythema.  
(Lt knee): full ROM.  
(Rt knee):some generalized swelling, + pain with extension, decreased ROM secondary to pain

Pertinent laboratory studies showed ESR 65 (H), ANA (-), Rheumatoid factor 10.8 (0-14), Urate 4.3, C-reactive protein 0.219, Glucose 107, K 5.1, Na 136, GFR nml, TSH nml, all remaining labs within normal limits
Physical therapy
NSAIDs as tolerated
Narcotics for pain control
Prophylactic low dose Colchicine
Intraarticular glucocorticoid injections
Aspiration of any future effusions
Chondrocalcinosis of the menisci of both knees with severe patellofemoral joint space narrowing bilaterally.  Medial and lateral intraarticular joint spaces are preserved bilaterally, as demonstrated on the AP radiograph. A suprapatellar effusion of the right knee is present. No left knee effusion is seen.

Long-term corticosteroid therapy
CC/HPI:  72 y/o female presents with history of several weeks bilateral persistent knee pain who now complains of an increase in right knee pain of abrupt onset over past few days.  The pain is minimally relieved with percocet, and self-rated as 9/10.  The patient denied any precipitating trauma, constitutional symptoms of fatigue/fever/weight change, and claims no arthralgias/myalgias/neuropathic pain. Patient has swelling and warmth associated with the joint pain.  Social history is significant for a positive current smoking profile and no ETOH use.
This patient with CPPD, with the classic linear calcifications in the menisci of both knees and the osteoarthritic changes at the patellofemoral joint, should be compared against the radiographic findings in HADD, with more dense calcifications, so one may appreciate the difference between the two pathologic processes on plain film.
    With this patient's history of stomach cancer and her age, NSAIDs might not be the first choice for treatment.  Intraarticular steroid injections in conjunction with aspiration of effusion (right knee) could providelocal disease control.
    Although this patient's temperature was normal and crystal arthropathies are more prevalent in an older population, an important diagnosis to rule out is septic arthritis.  If the patient was febrile with elevated WBC count and the knees was warm with erythema, infection could be considered,  and joint aspiration may be done with subsequent treatment if infection present.
