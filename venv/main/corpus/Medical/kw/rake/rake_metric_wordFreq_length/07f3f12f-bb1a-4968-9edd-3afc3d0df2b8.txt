Quantitative HcG: 125,000 mIU/mL 
Benign physical exam. Normal vital signs.
Patient will obtain serial quantitative HcG labs, and followup ultrasound.  If this progresses to embryonic demise, a d&c may be performed.
The uterus is retroflexed and contains a gestational sac at the fundus with a mean diameter of 2.37 cm corresponding to gestational age, seven weeks zero days.  A normal, complete decidual reaction is present, however there is a focal region of decreased subchorionic  echogenicity posteroinferiorly at the fundus with a volume of approximately 5 cc compared with a gestational sac volume of approximately 9 cc.  Yolk sac is present, is sonographically normal and measures approximately 3 mm.  Fetal pole is seen with an average measurement of 1.0 cm corresponding to gestational age, seven weeks one day. Fetal heart beat is seen on M-Mode Doppler at a rate of 141 beats per minute.  The adenxa were clear bilaterally.
Subchorionic hemorrhage
1. Subchorionic Hemorrhage
2. Uterine Myoma
3. Molar Pregnancy (co-existent)
4. Succenturiate placenta 
5. Chorioangioma
23 year-old black female with recently positive qualitative HcG.  Seven weeks EGA by dates.  New onset of painless, light vaginal bleeding.  Pelvic ultrasound was perfomed to r/o ectopic pregnancy or SAB.
The presence of a marginal abruption, or subchorionic hemorrhage is quite common in early pregnancy and if present before 12 weeks gestation, is considered by some to be an incidental finding.  After 12 weeks EGA, there is a less favorable outcome, with statistically a 50% loss rate.  A hemorrhage volume of less than 40% of that of the gestional sac has also been associated with a more favorable outcome.   

The other differntial possibilities listed can sometimes mimic the findings of subchorionic hemorrhage, but the imaging findings in this case, combined with the patients clinical history are fairly diagnostic.
