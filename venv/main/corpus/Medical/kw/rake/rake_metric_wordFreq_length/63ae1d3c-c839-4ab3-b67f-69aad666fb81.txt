Neck biopsy: Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma
Treatment consists of total or near-total thyroidectomy and removal of all involved lymph nodes. This is usually followed by radioiodine ablation to destroy the residual thyroid remnant and any metastatic tissue left behind after surgery. Thyroid replacement is then started to suppress TSH and prevent stimulation of residual thyroid tissue. Since papillary thyroid carcinoma in children is associated with a high rate of recurrence regular interval follow-up with serum thyroglobulin levels (a tumor marker) and radioiodine whole body scans are required.
