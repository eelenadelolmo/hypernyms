Texto: 
Palpable, mobile and nontender mass posterior to the right knee.
Otherwise unremarkable examination.
No labs.
Followup and treatment is only necessary if the patient becomes symptomatic.  Had the patient received a scan of her left popliteal fossa during the bout of pain and swelling months earlier, she may have had evidence of a ruptured popliteal cyst.
A well-circumscribed hypoechoic structure is localized posterior to the right knee.  Echogenic debris is visualized free-floating within the lumen.  The neck of the structure extends to the joint space between the medial head of the gastrocnemius and semimembranous muscles.  There is no internal color flow within the lesion.

The left popliteal fossa (not shown) is normal.
Popliteal (Baker's) Cyst
Popliteal (Baker's) Cyst

Popliteal artery aneurysm - no color flow

Cystic adventitial degeneration of the popliteal artery - no color flow

Septic arthritis - no erythema, pain or fever

Myxoid liposarcoma - no predominance of echogenic fat

Traumatic tear of the gastrocnemius muscle - intact muscle by US
63 year-old female with pain and swelling behind left knee 3 months ago, which has resolved.  Now with palpable abnormality posterior to right knee.
While MR is an excellent modality to evaluate popliteal cysts and exclude other possibilities within the differential diagnosis, ultrasound is less expensive and more readily available.  With color flow imaging, vascular abnormalities can be excluded.  If diagnostic features such as an apparent connection with the joint space between the medial head of the gastrocnemius and the semimembranous muscles are not visualized, then patients may benefit from MR if the diagnosis is clinically relevant.
