globes ruptured bilaterally with severe lid lacerations
The ruptured globes were repaired.  Although enucleation was not required, the patient will not regain sight in either eye due to the severity of the trauma.
Penetrating projectiles into the left and less severely right globes.  Note the numerous penetrating projectiles which are sand and rocks embeded deeply in the soft tissues of the face and scalp.  Fracture of the right zygomatic arch and penetrating fragment through the anterior wall of the right maxillary sinus, that is also filled with blood.
