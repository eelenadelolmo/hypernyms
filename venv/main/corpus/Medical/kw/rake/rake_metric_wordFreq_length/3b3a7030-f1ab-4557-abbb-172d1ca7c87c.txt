On second day of hospitalization, patient became tachycardic, short of breath, hypotensive, and febrile.  She developed a rigid abdomen and became lethargic.  An acute abdominal series suggested free air in the abdomen.  The patient was taken emergently to the OR where a large volume of pus was evacuated from the abdomen.  

Patient was discharge from hospital after stabalization and recovery.  Pathology report indicates a benign process.  Follow up with general surgery is planned.
1.  Large complex cystic lesion in the left upper quadrant which appears to arise from the pancreas and has an appearance of a mucinous cystic tumor with differential considerations given to solid and papillary neoplasm and cystic metastatic disease.
 
2.  Separate, nonenhancing cystic lesion in the posterior mediastinum at the level of the esophageal hiatus which may represent an enteric duplication cyst versus metastatic focus.
 
3.  Gastric varices/portosystemic collateral vessels,  mild central intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and delayed left nephrogram likely secondary to mass effect from dominant mass in the abdomen.

This 36 yo woman presents to the ED with severe upper back pain, nausea, four episodes of bilious vomiting, fevers, chills, and headaches.  The pain, which woke her from sleep, includes the majority of her back, left more than right, from the mid-scapulae to the middle of her back.  She denied any SOB or dizziness.  She endorsed having regular bowel movements and urination and that her LMP was one week ago.  Denies being pregnant and said she had two recent pregnancy tests, which were negative.

Mucinous cystic neoplasm
- A cystic epithelial neoplasm that occurs in most commonly in women in their 40s and 50s.  
- May be benign or malignant
- Does not communicate with the pancreatic ductal epithelium. 
- Columnar epithelium produces mucin  
- Often found incidentally, but may grow large enough to compress adjacent organs resulting in a variety of symptoms depending on the compressed organ.
- Best detected with contrast enhanced CT.  The may be uniocular, although, more commonly they are septated.  
- Concern for malignant transformation is increased if the any of the following features are present: a larger size (greater than 5 cm); a thickened or irregular wall; internal solid component; calcification of the cyst wall.

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms
- Patients often present with active symptoms, most commonly abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and weight loss.   
- Least common form of cystic pancreatic neoplasms
- More common in young women than men
- Appear as mixed solid and cystic pancreatic lesions on cross sectional imaging.   On MRI, they may appear as well demarcated solid tumors.  
- Malignant potential is not well known and no factors have been identified that predict malignancy with any reliability.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN)
- Potentially malignant intraductal epithelial tumors comprised of mucin producing cells.  
- Many may be detected incidentally in asymptomatic patients while others may present with non-specific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, anorexia or pancreatitis secondary to obstruction of the main duct.  
- Most frequently presents in the fifth to seventh decades with an approximately equal number of men and women affected in the United States.  
- Both pancreatic protocol CT and MRCP are good initial studies for detection of IPMN and can determine relationship to surrounding tissues, presence of lymph node involvement,  or metastatic disease.  
- Tumor diameter greater than 3 cm is highly suspicious for malignancy.
