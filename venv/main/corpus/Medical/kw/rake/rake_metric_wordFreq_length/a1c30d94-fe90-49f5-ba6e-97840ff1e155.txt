The patient was taken back to the OR for removal of the retained lap sponge.
Surgical sponges can be used for removing excess fluid from the field, packing, tissue retraction, or dissection. Radiopaque markers are incorporated into all sponges. Some are interwoven in the sponge itself. Others, such as the lap sponge, have markers located in an attached string or tail.
Retained lap sponge
Given radiopaque tail of sponge, the differential is either retained surgical sponge or sponge overlying the patient.  However, the lateral radiograph confirms the diagnosis.
57year old woman with fallopian tube carcinoma who had a surgical removal of the tumor 6 days ago; and, now complains of increasing abdominal pain and decreasing flatulence and bowel movements.
This case nicely demonstrates the radiographic appearance of a retained sponge.  Once the frontal view was obtained, a lateral was requested to confirm the location of the lap sponge.  With the lateral, the diagnosis was confirmed and the patient was returned to the OR for removal.
