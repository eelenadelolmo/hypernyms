Discontinuous nodular enhancement on contrast enhanced CT with positive NM RBC scan.
Hepatic Hemangioma
Hemangioma
(Hepatocellular Carinoma,FNH,Hepatic Adenoma,hypervascular metastases would not be expected to have positive RBC scan, although could potentially have similar appearance on CT)
Abnormal hepatic finding on CT scan in patient with abdominal pain.
A hemangioma is defined pathologically as a tumor composed of multiple vascular channels lined by a single layer of endothelial cells supported by a thin, fibrous stroma.  They are divided into two catagories; typical and giant.  Typical hemangiomas are small, asymptomatic and discovered incidentally.  Giant hemangiomas are >5 cm and may hemorrhage or thrombose.

CT findings include a hypodense, well circumscribed lesion on pre-contrast CT with nodular intense peripheral enhancement on dynamic bolus contrast phase.  Nuclear SPECT imaging  shows increased activity of 99-Tc labled RBC's on delayed blood pool imaging; however, this study is only useful if the tumor in question is 2-3 cm or greater in size.
