Asymptomatic lesions can be monitored with radiographs and clinical follow up.  Enlarging or symptomatic periosteal chondromas are usually removed with a rim of normal bone to decrease the chance of recurrence.  Malignant degeneration into a peripheral chondrosarcoma is extremely rare with these lesions.
AP and lateral radiographs of the right tibia and fibula:  A cortically based radiolucent lesion is present along the proximal lateral metaphysis of the fibula.  There is associated saucerization of the underlying bone cortex with an outer rim of periosteum and a very minimal periosteal reaction.  The lesion is confined to the cortex and does not appear to extend into the medullary canal.  No soft tissue mass is visualized.
Periosteal Chondroma
• Periosteal Chondrosarcoma
Complained of a palpable bump and mild pain along the right lateral lower extremity.
This patient is 38 years old which is a typical age when these lesions occur.  Most periosteal chondromas occur during the second through fourth decades of life.  This patient’s lesion involves the proximal metaphysis of the fibula (a long bone) which is typical for periosteal chondromas.  The fact that this patient’s lesion is cortically based and causes saucerization or scalloping of the underlining bone cortex is highly characteristic of a periosteal chondroma.  The lesion also has a thin rim of overlying periosteum with a very mild periosteal reaction which are also characteristic features of periosteal chondromas.  This patient’s lesion is also smaller than 3 cm which is more consistent with periosteal chondromas.  Periosteal chondrosarcomas tend to be larger and demonstrate invasion into the underlying cortex unlike the lesion in this case.
