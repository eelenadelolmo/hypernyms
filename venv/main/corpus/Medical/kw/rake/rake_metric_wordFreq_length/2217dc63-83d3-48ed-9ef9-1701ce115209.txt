Crepitus in neck region and decreased breath sounds in L lung field.
-Subcutaneous emphysema will resolve spontaneously without surgical intervention once the primary air leak is sealed.
-Specific therapy for pneumomediastinum is seldom needed. Therapy is typically directed at alleviating pain. Hyperbaric treatment can be performed but is indicated in the setting of baro trauma and not indicated for pneumomediastinum alone. In the case of life threatening situations, needle decompression can be used.
PA demonstrates sternal wiring.
Mediastinal lucent lines from diaphram to aortic knob.
Lucent line bilaterally midclavicular up through the soft tissue of the neck.
LLL chest tube with lucent lines superiorly.
Line peripherally in L lobe from the 5th rib inferiorly moving superior and medial to the 3rd rib superior to the aortic knob. There are lung marking inferior and to the line described with no lung archetecture superior to the line.
Pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, atelectasis
Subcutaneous emphysema/ Pneumomediastinum:
  1. Baro trauma
  2. ARDS
  3. Alveolar rupture
  4. Perforated viscus
  5. Ruptured upper airway
  6. Necrotizing fasciitis
  7. Trauma
  8. Surgery
67 y/o male s/p 3 vessel CABG.
