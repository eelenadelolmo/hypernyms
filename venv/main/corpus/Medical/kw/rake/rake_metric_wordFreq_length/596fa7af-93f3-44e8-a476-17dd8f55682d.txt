Carotid Artery Stenting and hemi-craniectomy.  Unfortunately, she died three days after admission, due to brain herniation.
â€¢ Angio: Bilateral ICA dissection with occlusion on right
â€¢ CT:  Hyperdense ACA and MCA signs due to embolization
â€¢ MRI: Acute ACA and MCA distribution infarcts on left
Carotid Dissection with left MCA and ACA infarction
â€¢ Embolic infarction
â€¢ Thrombotic infarction
â€¢ Dissection Infarction
41 year old woman with history of hypertension presents with 4 hour history of right-sided weakness and aphasia
Hyperdense ACA sign is significantly less common than the hyperdense MCA arteries.  These dissections were not associated with trauma.
Fibromuscular dysplasia was suspected.
