Lower extremity exam: Inspection revealed symmetric lower extremities with no edema, erythema, or other skin changes. There was no tenderness to palpation. The patient had full passive ROM of the ankle and sub-talar joints, with minimal pain. There were no focal neurological deficits. The patient moved both lower extremities well. 

No laboratory tests were performed for the evaluation of this patient.
Summary of Plain Film findings: There is bilateral pes planus. No definite bony coalition is identified. The dome of each talus is short, and there is sclerosis involving each talus. The right side is involved to a greater extent than the left. At the posterior aspect of each talus, there is an abnormal large calcific density with an appearance suggestive of an accessory ossification center, with significant sclerosis between the main body of the talus and this bony lesion. There may be fragmentation of the right talus. The talus and calcaneus on each side are abnormally parallel in alignment.

Summary of CT findings: The patient shows findings of bilateral os trigonum syndrome, greater on the right than left. Large os trigonum is present bilaterally with sclerosis, bony irregularity, and subchondral cyst formation along the synchondrosis between the os trigonum and talus. No tarsal coalition is identified at the anterior, middle, or posterior facets of the subtalar joints. Bilateral foot deformity is present with a high plantar arch and inversion of the foot.

The patient is a 9 year old girl who presented to a large children's hospital ED with complaint of chronic, bilateral ankle pain. She reported no history of trauma. She reported no history of skin changes or swelling, and there was no history of local or chronic infection. Pain was worsened with walking and activity. The patient had an irregular gate and an irregular wear pattern on the sole of her shoes (more wear on lateral portions).

The patient also has a past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, increased BMI, LVH/increased LV mass, acanthosis nigricans, and suspected insulin resistance.
