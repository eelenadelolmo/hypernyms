Conservative treatment, daily follow-up chest radiographs performed.  Patient discharged from hospital 5 days after event.
Pneumomediastinum, extensive subcutaneous emphysema in neck, pneumopericardium.
Pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium
Pneumothorax (especially for appearance at inferior lungs)
Stage IVA squamous cell carcinoma of the glottic region.  Esophageal dilation today for progressive dysphagia.  Severe onset of pain immediately post-dilation.
Pneumothorax may be mimicked by extrathoracic air dissecting between the chest wall and parietal pleura, or between superior diaphragmatic surface and parietal pleura -- both examples seen in this case.
CT is the most sensitive and specific way to evaluate for mediastinal air.
Although not demonstrated well in this case, the abnormal appearance of a "continuous diaphragm sign" is demonstrated by a lucent line beneath the heart border, that "connects" the bilateral hemidiaphragms. Air beneath the heart may create this appearance.
