Efferent pupillary defect left eye.
Surgical drainage
CT Progressive destruction of skull base with invasion of left cavernous sinus from sphenoid sinus mass.

MRI  Mass is fluid intensity on all scan sequences.
Sphenoid Mucocele and Sinusitis
Atypical fungal sinusitis
Squamous cell carcinoma of sinus
Mucocele
Infected Mucocele
44 year old woman with symptoms of sinusitis was evaluated by CT in January.  This is a followup visit in August because of worsening symptoms.
It is atypical for a mucocele to enlarge so quickly unless there is associated infection.

Absent flow void in left cavernous ICA is due to either compression by the mass or possible proximal stenosis or occlusion in the neck.
