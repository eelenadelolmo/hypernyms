small laceration under right cheek bone with proptosis of right eye
Craniotomy for decompression.  Ball bearing was removed
Fracture of lateral orbital wall with fracture fragments extending into orbit with resultant proptosis and inferior wall blow out fracture.  The projectile which proved to be a ball bearing then penetrated the anterior portion of the middle cranial fossa with some fracture fragments and air and proceeded without much evidence of trauma to the right posterior parietal area where there was an associated hematoma.
IED - improvised explosive device
Injured by nearby IED
