Texto: 
The anterior communicating artery aneurysm was treated successfully with intravascular embolization.  Imaging at 5 months revealed the cystic lesion to be unchanged relative to the initial scan.  The downside to treating with albendazole and steroids would be the development of increased inflammation, which could worsen neurological status. Given the risks of surgery and medical treatment, and his relatively asymptomatic state and no progression of lesion on repeat imaging, we will follow up with repeat imaging in 2 months.  If the lesion is worse at this time, we will treat.
Neurocysticercosis and Ruptured Subarachnoid Aneurysm
Metastatic lesions characteristically lodge at the corticomedullary junction and can enhance in a ringlike pattern, and often present with more edema than expected for the size of the lesion.  A High Grade Astrocytoma (WHO 3 or 4) can be included in the differential, although they are more likely to be heterogeneous with irregular borders. Fluid suggests parasitic infections, including cysticercosis, paragonimiasis, or echinococcus.
The patient is a 54-year-old man who presents with sudden onset headache, nausea, vomiting and hypertension.  Prior to these symptoms, he had been in his usual state of health.
In our patient, the cystic lesion had a racemose or grapelike appearance which is common when the lesion occurs in the subarachnoid area adjacent to the ventricles.  Racemose form refers to the presence of multiple cysts in the basal cisterns where the vesicles can have different sizes, and the cysts can be attached to the meninges; they do not have a scolex.  The racemose form of NCC, which appears macroscopically as groups of cysticerci, often in clusters that resemble bunches of grapes, located in the subarachnoid space, is associated with poor prognosis and elevated mortality rate (over 20%). Because of their location, they can produce hydrocephalus, which is caused by inflammation of meninges with subsequent fibrosis and obstruction.

A subarachnoid bleed associated with an aneurysm in the setting of NCC is a rare event with only four reports in the literature.  Huang et al. report a hemorrhage from a ruptured left MCA aneurysm, that was subsequently treated with a craniotomy and clipping of the aneurysm.  Kim et al report an aneurysm occurring in the anterior temporal artery.  In all of these case reports, the aneurysm was in close proximity to the cystic lesion, had inflammation and fibrosis associated with the aneurysmal wall, and were not in common locations for a berry aneurysm.  The location of the aneurysm in this patient, at the ACA, is a common location for a berry aneurysm.  The location of the aneurysm, in the ACA, is separated in space from the cystic lesion, in the right temporal area.  However, inflammation from a second smaller infected cyst (not picked up on MRI) cannot be ruled out.
