Patient is currently being followed by Rheumatology.
Foot: Osteoarthritis of the first MTP is demonstrated.  There is ossification of the Achilles tendon.

Wrist: Calcification of the TFCC and chondral cartilage of the wrist.

Knee:  Chondrocalcinosis is present.
Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease
Gout
Primary hyperparathyroidism
Hemochromatosis
Knee pain in an elderly male.
Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease is characterized by calcification in and around joints and by structural changes in the joints.  This is pyrophosphate arthropathy. Non-weight bearing joints such as radiocarpal, metacarpophalangeal joints, glenohumeral joints and the elbow are affected.  Patellofemoral and radiocarpal joint space narrowing may be seen.  

Subchondral cysts are one of the hallmarks of this disease.  Cysts may form before cartilage loss presents.  Cysts are larger and more numerous that in osteoarthritis.  

CPPD in fibrocartilage is most common in the menisci of the knee, triangular fibrocartilage of the wrist, acetabular labrum, pubic symphysis and annulus fibrosis of the intervertebral disk.  

Synovial calcifications are common in the wrist, knee, MCP and MTP joints.  Capsular calcification is most commonly observed in the elbow, glenohumeral, MTP, and MCP joints.  

Tendon calcifications are present in as much as 13% of patients.  The most frequently affected sites are the supraspinatus, triceps, quadriceps, gastrocnemius and Achilles tendons.

The lunotriquetral ligament is more common than the triangular fibrocartilage to be calcified.  Degenerative tears of the triangular fibrocartilage and degeneration of the articular cartilage of the lunate are associated with CPPD crystal deposits.

The knee is most commonly involved and affects the medial femortibial compartment.  Isolated patellofemoral narrowing should suggest underlying CPPD crystal deposition disease in an older patient, even without joint calcification.  Wedge shaped meniscal calcification is more frequent than linear calcification (lateral more often than medial).

The talocalcaneonavicular joint may be selectively affected  The Achilles tendon and plantar fascia may calcify.
