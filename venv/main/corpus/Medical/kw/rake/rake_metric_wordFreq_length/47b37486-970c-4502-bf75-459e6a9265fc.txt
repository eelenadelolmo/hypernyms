Slender, elderly male.  No abdominal pain, no localized symptoms.
In this older patient with multiple comorbidities and surgical risk factors, periodic monitoring is currently planned.
Lobulated multicystic lesion which involves the pancreatic head and uncinate process, predominantly.  The main pancreatic duct is dilated to 10mm and there is also branch duct involvement within the pancreatic body.  No mural nodules or solid masses are identified.
Combined-type Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm
• Chronic pancreatitis
• Pancreatic pseudocyst
• Mucinous cystic neoplasm
• Serous cystadenoma
79 y/o white male, preoperative evaluation pending CABG.  History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes.  Recent 50 lb weight loss.
Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), also referred to in previous literature as intraductal papillary mucinous tumor (IPMT) is a low-grade malignancy that arises from the epithelial lining of the main or branch pancreatic ducts, and is characterized by excessive mucin production.  IPMN is classified into three types: branch pancreatic duct type, main pancreatic duct type, and combined type.  Combined type is the most common.

IPMN presents clinically with diarrhea, pain, weight loss, acute pancreatitis and diabetes.  Typical age of onset is 60-80 y/o, more commonly in males.

CT findings for branch pancreatic duct type include a thin, irregular and peripheral lobulated multicystic lesion (“grape-like” clusters).The main pancreatic duct type appears as a markedly dilated and tortuous main pancreatic duct.  Polypoid lesions may be seen lining the main duct.  The combined type appears as a multicystic lesion (commonly within the uncinate process) which is contiguous with a markedly dilated and tortuous main pancreatic duct. MRCP will show communication between the dilated duct and cystic lesions.

The differential diagnosis for IPMN includes chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst, mucinous cystic neoplasm and serous cystadenoma.  This patient had no history of pancreatitis.  

Imaging features of IPMN with invasive carcinoma may include mural nodularity or solid mass measuring 3-10 mm, diffuse or multifocal main duct involvement, main or combined duct types, main pancreatic duct measuring > 10-15 mm, branch duct type measuring > 3 cm or mural nodularity, common bile duct > 15 mm, or evidence of metastases.  Generally, main duct and combined duct types are resected in good surgical candidates.  Branch duct type IPMN without suggestion of invasive carcinoma may be monitored.  Although all IPMNs are felt to have malignant potential.
