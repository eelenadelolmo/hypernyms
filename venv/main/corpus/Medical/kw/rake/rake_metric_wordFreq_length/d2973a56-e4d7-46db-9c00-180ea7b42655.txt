Texto: 
The patient's temperature is 99.8 F.  She is slightly tachycardic with a heart rate of 104.  Her other vital signs are normal.  She is very tender to palption over the left abdomen with positive rebound.  White blood count was 20K, amylase and lipase were normal.
Oral antibiotics are usually required.  Liquid or low fiber foods are advised during acute diverticulitis attacks.  In severe diverticulitis with high fever and pain, patients are hospitalized and given intravenous antibiotics.  Surgery is reserved for those with persistent bowel obstruction or abscess not responding to antibiotics.
There is diverticulosis of the transverse, descending and sigmoid colon.  The distal descending and sigmoid colon has prominent wall thickening with surrounding inflammatory changes of the pericolic fat with adjacent air filled diverticuli.  No discrete fluid collections or free air are present.
Diverticulitis
1.  Diverticulitis.
2.  Micro-perforated colon cancer.
54 year old female is brought to the emergency room with severe left lower quadrant pain.  The patient reports several prior incidents of similar pain and had previously been treated with antibiotics.
The patient was admitted to the hospital overnight and was started on intravenous antibiotics.  The patient was released the following day on oral antibiotics and underwent a follow-up CT scan to rule out an underlying mass.
