Cerebral vasculitis is a highly treatable condition; there currently is no standard management that has been established, but most authors agree that acute-phase treatment includes cessation of vasoconstrictors, treatment of associated conditions, vasospasm treatment (calcium channel antagonists), corticosteroids, headache relief, blood pressure control, and stroke, cerebral edema, and seizure treatment as needed.  A high dose intravenous steroids ‚Äì probably best as intravenous methyl prednisolone 1 gram daily for 3 days.  Other treatments including azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day) for 10 months, methotrexate 10‚Äì25 mg on a weekly basis, intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 mg/kg/day for 5 days), plasmapheresis, and Campath-1H may be used depending upon the etiology.

CT:  Axial Noncontrast CT of the Brain showed an acute SAH in the right frontal lobe brain.  

Cerebral angiogram:  Lateral projection of the right cerebral angiogram demonstrated irregular variable caliber in cortical vessels in the right MCA distribution.  

MRI/MRA:  Diffusion weight image, Apparent Diffusion Coefficient MRI, and T2-weighted images of brain demonstrate an acute infarct in the right mid-posterior cerebellar in the superior cerebellar vascular territory.  

Axial FLAIR MRI of the brain showed multiple nonspecific small foci of increased FLAIR signal within the anterior aspects of the external capsule bilaterally.  

3D time of flight MRA of the cerebral arteries demonstrated MCA cortical vessel caliber variation.

34-year-old African American G1P1 female with no significant medical history presents to the ER four days postpartum complaining of the ‚Äúworst headache of her life‚Äù on the right-sided of her head.
Postpartum cerebral angiopathy is a rare ailment that affects females who are otherwise healthy and recently had a normal pregnancy and uncomplicated delivery.  Like primary and other secondary cerebral vasculitis, postpartum cerebral angiopathy may cause ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and neurological deficits.  More commonly, secondary cerebral angiopathy occurs in the setting of other medical conditions such as infections, systemic vasculitis (Wegener‚Äôs granulomatosis & polyarteritis), connective tissue diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus & rheumatoid arthritis), medications, illicit drugs, carcinomas (lymphoma & leukemia), and Behcet‚Äôs disease.  Other conditions, therefore, need to be ruled out before a diagnosis of postpartum cerebral angiopathy can be made including preeclampsia /eclampsia. 

  Contrast catheter angiography and magnetic resonance imaging/angiography (MRI/MRA) are the typical imaging modalities used to help with the diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis although, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and Indium-labelled white cell nuclear scanning may provide some benefit.  Definitive diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis is typically made by biopsy of brain. 

  In this patient she presented to the ER with the ‚Äúworse headache of her life‚Äù on the right side 4 days postpartum.  Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) showed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with the right sylvian fissure and the sulci of the right frontal lobe.  Further vascular studies including a CT angiogram (CTA), contrast angiography, and MRA showed no evidence of an intracerebral aneurysm.  The patient had no history of hypertension and was not hypertensive during the headache.  She was tested several times throughout pregnancy with no evidence of elevated blood pressure, proteinuria, or headaches looking for preeclampsia.  The patient had an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 56 mm/hour.  

Upon further investigation the patient had a contrast enhanced angiogram which showed irregular variable caliber vessels with ‚Äúsausage linked‚Äù appearance in the cortical branches of both the middle cerebral arteries with a more prominence on the right side as opposed to the left.  The MRI also showed and acute 5 mm left cerebellar infarct located within a superior cerebellar artery vascular territory and multiple nonspecific small foci of increased FLAIR signal within the anterior aspects of the external capsule bilaterally.  

This patient had several classic imaging findings of cerebral vasculopathy of small vessel ischemic disease, SAH, and cortical enhancement.  She had no known significant past medical history including autoimmune disorders, systemic vasculitis, or connective tissue disorders.  She had a normal uncomplicated pregnancy and developed her first symptoms 4 days postpartum fitting the description of postpartum cerebral angiopathy.  

The patient was treated with oral prednisolone and was felt that a brain biopsy was not necessary in this case to make the definitive diagnosis.
