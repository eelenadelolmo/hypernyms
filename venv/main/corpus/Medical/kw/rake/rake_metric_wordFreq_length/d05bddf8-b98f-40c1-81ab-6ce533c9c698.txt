H. Pylori negative.
Serum gastrin elevated to 884 at time of study.
Unknown.
A large 5 cm mass is seen in the porta hepatis region on the CT examination, between the head of the pancreas and the inferior vena cava, causing mass effect on the vena cava.  A hypodense lesion in the liver is suspicious for a metastatic focus.
The In-111 octreotide scan demostrates an intense focus of activity in the porta hepatis region, with fainter foci of activity in the liver and left hilum.
