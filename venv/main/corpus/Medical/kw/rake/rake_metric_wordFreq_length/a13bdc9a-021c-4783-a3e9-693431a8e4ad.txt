Texto: 
The patient underwent surgery for removal of the mass overlying his lateral malleolus, which was symptomatic in terms of allowing his shoe to properly fit.  At surgery, the mass was tightly adherent to the periosteum.  Pathology confirmed a xanthoma.
AP and lateral radiographs of the right ankle, reveal a soft-tissue mass without internal calcifications overlying the lateral malleolus.  Additionally, there is fusiform thickening of the Achilles Tendon.

MRI of the Right Ankle:  There is a multilobulated mass, measuring 2.6 x 2.5 x 1.4 cm at the anterior aspect of the fibula, that is isointense on T1, hypointense on T2, and isointense to the Achilles tendon on T2 weighted sequences.  There is no associated bony erosion.  Additionally, there is marked thickening of the Achilles tendon without hyperintense signal to suggest tear.  Also noted is convex curvature to the normally flat or concave anterior aspect of Achilles tendon.

MRI of the Left Ankle:  There is marked thickening of the Achilles tendon without hyperintense signal to suggest tear.  Also noted is convex curvature to the normally flat or concave anterior aspect of Achilles tendon.  Thickening of the tendinous portion of the medial plantar fascia is also noted.

51 yo male with soft-tissue ankle mass.
Further history obtained reveals the patient has a past medical history significant for hypercholesterolemia.
