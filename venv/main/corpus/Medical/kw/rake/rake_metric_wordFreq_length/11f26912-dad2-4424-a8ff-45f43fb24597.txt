Initial retrograge urethrogram showed irregularity at the proximal bulbar urethra

Follow-up study one year later shows a high grade stricture in the same location
Urethral Stricture (Confirmed by Urethroscopy)
iatrogenic (from instrumentation)
posttraumatic
post-infections (bacterial)
neoplasm
History of gonococcal infection. Rule out stricture.

Initial retrograge urethrogram showed irregularity at the proximal bulbar urethra that was likely caused by known previous gonococcal infection.

Follow-up study one year later showed a high grade stricture in the same location.
