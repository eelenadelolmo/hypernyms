Corticosteroid therapy.

She is getting progressively worse.
Axial T2-weighted MR and FLAIR images show multiple subcortical white matter lesions with abnormally high signal intensity at the level of centrum semiovale.
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
• Normal variant with high signal in the corticospinal tracts
• Friedreich ataxia
• Vitamin B12 deficiency
• Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gherig Disease)
• Post-Polio Syndrome
• Multiple Sclerosis
47 y.o. woman  with 3 years progressive muscular weakness of both arms and both legs.  Recently, breathing became difficult because the muscles of the respiratory system are weakened.  Bulbar symptoms were absent.
Clinical differential diagnosis : 
Spinal cord lesions, Spinal bone lesions, Infections, Endocrine disorders
Examples: hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, diabetic radiculopathy.
 Toxins. Postpolio syndrome, Huntington's disease, Friedreich's ataxia, sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, polymyositis, myasthenia gravis, muscular dystrophies

High signal intensity in the corticospinal tract has also been described in some healthy individuals. In such cases, however, the abnormal signal intensity is not seen on the PD images.  

High signal intensity is alo seen along with Friedreich ataxia and vitamin B12 deficiency this  is usually limited to the internal capsule and does not extend to the corona radiata or brain stem as in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . 

This extended involvement distinguishes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis from the periventricular pattern of multiple sclerosis.
