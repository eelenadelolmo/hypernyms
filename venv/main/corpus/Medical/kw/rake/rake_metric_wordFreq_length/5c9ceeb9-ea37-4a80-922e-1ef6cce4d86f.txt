A 24- hour urine for cortisol, VMA, HVA, metanephrine and DAG was collected. The cortisol level was slightly elevated at two and half times the normal limit, 45 up to 101. Her epinephrine levels were slightly elevated at 105, as compared to less than 100. The remainder of her labs were all within normal limits.
The patient underwent right renal artery and right adrenal gland artery embolization prior to surgical resection of mass.
• CT shows a 9.8 x 8.5 cm mass that appears to be arising from the upper pole of the right kidney. 
• MRI confirms 9 X 9 X 9 cm heterogenous vascular mass at upper pole of right kidney with no apparent extension into the IVC.
• Venacavogram shows extrinsic compression from right renal mass but no evidence of intracaval filling defect.

36-year-old woman complains of progressive right upper quadrant pain.  No prior medical or surgical history.
The patient underwent a right renal and right adrenal artery embolization and a venacavogram. The venacavogram did not show any tumor thrombus; however, it did show that the mass was impinging on the cava. A 24- hour urine for cortisol, VMA, HVA, metanephrine and DAG were sent. The cortisol level was slightly elevated at two and half times the normal limit, 45 up to 101. Her epinephrine levels were slightly elevated at 105, as compared to less than 100. The remainder of her labs were all within normal limits. 

After the suspicion for pheochromocytoma was ruled out, the surgical team proceeded with performing a right radical nephrectomy. She was taken to the operating room where she underwent a right radical nephrectomy and partial liver resection via a chevron incision. She had a significant amount of tumor extending up to the liver posterior to the cava and laterally to the retroperitoneum. The right gonadal vein, the right ureter, the right gonadal artery in addition to the right kidney, and adrenal gland were removed on block. Surgical Oncology provided their intraoperative assistance with the partial liver resection.
