Subtle lucencies in a linear or tubular configuration on plain film correspond with cystic area posteromedially within RLL on CT.  Contrast CT shows a small feeding artery from the descending thoracic aorta.  The patient's cough and fever were due to consolidation of the sequestered lung.
Pulmonary Sequestration
cystic adenomatoid malformation
bronchiectasis
65 y/o WM with non-resolving cough and fever despite antibiotic therapy
While 90% of sequestrations are on the left side, this case is on the right. It is probably intralobar.
The feeding vessel was small and branched off the descending thoracic aorta.
