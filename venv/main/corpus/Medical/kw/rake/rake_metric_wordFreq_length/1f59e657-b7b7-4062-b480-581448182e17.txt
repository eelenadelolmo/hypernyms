Texto: 
On physical exam patient has an enlarged, nontender thyroid gland without palpable nodules.  Labs were significant for TSH <0.08 ÂµIU/mL (normal 0.5-5.0 ÂµIU/mL), free T4 of 5.88 (normal 0.71-1.85), and T3 of 510.55 (normal 59.00-174.00).
Patients was treated with  radioiodine ablation using 15 mCi of  I-131.
Thyroid uptake using 7ÂµCi of I-131 and thyroid scan using 10 mCi Tc-99m.  The 24 hour radioiodine uptake was determined to be 89.4% (normal range, 8-30%).  The planar and pinhole scan of the neck shows diffuse, homogenous uptake, right greater than left, in an enlarged thyroid gland.  The pyramidal lobe is visible.
GRAVES' DISEASE
Graves' Disease
17-year old white male with three to four-month history of proptosis, tachycardia, heat intolerance and weight loss.  Patient placed on Atenolol for control of heart rate.
Gravesâ€™ Disease is the most common cause of thyrotoxicosis.  The peak incidence is in the third and fourth decades with a female predominance of 5:1.  It is an autoimmune disorder characterized by circulating thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins, which bind to the thyroid stimulating receptors of the thyroid cells causing thyroid gland hypertrophy and increased synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormone.  Symptoms include tachycardia, heat intolerance, weight loss, diarrhea, agitation or nervousness, tremor and weakness.  This patient was atypical based on the fact that he was a young male. 

Laboratory findings in Gravesâ€™ disease include suppressed TSH and elevated levels of Free T4 and T3.  The 24-hour radioiodine uptake will be increased above 30%.  Thyroid scans using Tc99m show diffuse, homogenous uptake within an enlarged gland.   This patient had the classic signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism including a diffuse homogenous uptake greater than 80% on his nuclear medicine study.
