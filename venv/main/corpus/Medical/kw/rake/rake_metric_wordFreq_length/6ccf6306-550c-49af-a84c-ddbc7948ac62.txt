On initial evaluation, the patient was pleasant and cooperative with all vitals within normal limits.  The external ear canal was patent.  The tympanic membrane was non-injected and appropriately mobile without scarring or fluid within the middle-ear.  Initial speech language pathology assessment showed significant receptive, expressive and articulation deficits resulting in reduced pragmatic/play skills.  Audiological assessment showed a speech awareness threshold of 40 bilaterally at the middle level of hearing.  Tympanometry results were normal bilaterally.  Responses to tonal stimuli in the right ear were moderately-severe, sloping to a severe level of hearing at 1 kHz and 4 kHz.  Responses to tonal stimuli were unremarkable in the left ear.  Unmasked bone conduction responses were consistent with a sensorineural component.  Distortion product otoacoustic emissions were present at 2 kHz in the right ear and emissions were absent at 3-6 kHz in right ear.
Patient was fitted with a Phonak Aero behind the ear 311 hearing aids at a volume setting of 2?  which resulted in assisted speech reception thresholds at a normal to borderline-normal (20-25 db) level of hearing in soundfield.  The hearing aids required a subsequent volume adjustment to 2 bilaterally at audiological follow-up.  The patient was referred to speech and aural rehabilitation therapy.  

The patient was seen for follow-up over five years.  She continued to show a stable response to aided hearing with hearing aides that were finely adjusted during regular audiological assessment and testing.  Over the five years of follow-up, the patientâ€™s hearing loss was non-progressive.  His thyroid and renal function remained normal during follow-up.
A CT scan of the internal auditory canal and temporal bones was obtained which showed the external auditory canals to be widely patent bilaterally with a well-aerated middle ear.  There was no abnormal soft tissue or fluid density identified within the middle ear.  The ossicles had a normal appearance.  The aditus ad antrum and mastoid air cells were well aerated bilaterally.  The cochlea and semicircular canals were fully formed.  The internal auditory canals had a symmetric appearance.  The vestibular aqueduct was abnormally enlarged on the right but was normal on the left.

The patient is a 3 year old girl who was referred to a Speech Language Pathologist and Audiologist for evaluation of delayed speech and poor hearing. 

PMH:  C-section at 35 weeks for for low amniotic fluid and a non-reassuring fetal heart rate.  She failed her newborn hearing screening but received no follow-up assessment until she was 3 years old and presented with concerns for delayed attainment of speech, language and motor milestones.  At this time of presentation, she was using only single words in small sentences to communicate.  The parents denied a history otitis media, head trauma or hearing loss in the family.
The patient was diagnosed with enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome.  Initial imaging showed an enlarged vestibular aqueduct which is commonly associated with multiple syndromes, most commonly Pendred and Nonsyndromic Hearing Loss and Deafness which were both ruled out by genetic mutation analysis.  She was treated with hearing aids resulting in a significant improvement in speech recognition.  She was advised to avoid all contact sports to prevent a sudden traumatic hearing deficit.  Her hearing remained stable over the course of a five year follow-up period.  She will be followed with yearly visits for audiological testing.
