Texto: 
The patient is currently status-post right renal transplantation and is undergoing work-up for liver transplant.

It is important to remember that in utero, severe renal disease is accompanied by oligohydramnios from decreased fetal urine production, with resultant pulmonary hypoplasia.  In the neonatal period, patients are prone to pneumothorax, and may have associated VACTERL (Vertebral anomalies, Anal atresia, Cardiovascular anomalies, Tracheoesophageal fistula, Esophageal atresia, Renal and Limb anomalies) syndrome in conjunction with Potter facies (hypertelorism, epicanthus, low set ears, etc.).
AP radiograph of the chest and abdomen demonstrates hypoinflated lungs, with a markedly distended abdomen.
AP radiograph of the chest and abdomen demonstrates centrally placed loops of bowel, with prominent hepatic and renal shadows.
Cross table lateral radiograph demonstrates anteriorly displaced loops of bowel with a posterior abdominal mass.  Hypoinflated lung volumes are also seen.
Longitudal sonographic image through the right lobe of the liver reveals periportal heterogeneity, consistent with early hepatic fibrosis. No hepatic masses are seen.  An enlarged hyperechoic right kidney is partially shown with loss of the corticomedullary differentiation.
Sonographic images through the kidneys reveals enlarged hyperechoic kidneys with loss of the corticomedullary differentiation.  The right kidney measuring 16.6 cm and the left kidney measures 18.5 cm in greatest dimension.
MR images through the kidneys demonstrates a morphologically abnormal and markedly enlarged right kidney.  The patient is status-post left nephrectomy.  Mild hepatosplenomegaly is also seen.
Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease
DDx of AP radiographs of the abdomen.

Neonatal Ascites...Biliary Ascites (Perforation of Bile Duct), Urinary Ascites (Intraperitoneal bladder, ureteric, or upper tract perforation/ Posterior Urethral Valves), Chylous Ascites (congenital lymphatic abnormality)

Neonatal Abdominal Mass....Renal (Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney, Hydronephrosis, Polycystic Disease, Posterior Urethral Valves, Renal Vein Thrombosis (dehydration/hemoconcentration, Mesoblastic Nephroma)), Adrenal Masses (Hemorrhage, Neuroblastoma), Liver (Cysts, Hepatoblastoma, Hemangioendothelioma, Mesenchymal hamartoma, Metastatic Disease), Choledochal cyst, Duplication of GI Tract, Pelvic and Genital Tract (Ovarian Cysts, Hydrometrocolpos, Distended Bladder, Teratoma, Anterior Meningomyelocele)
2 day old male with abdominal distention.
