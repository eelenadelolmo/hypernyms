Patient is presently receiving monthly IVIG (2mg/kg) infusions with pretreatment of Tylenol 15mg/kg  and concurrent steroid bursts (Solumedrol 30mg/kg). Will reassess with CT, PFTs every 6 months.

Literature review shows current recommendations as follows:

* Systemic glucocorticoids - noted improvement during acute phase but unclear effects during resolution. Studies suggest fewer exacerbations and possible decrease in fibrogenesis. Oral >> inhaled. Generally starting dose recommended <1mg/kg/day
* Immunosuppression as adjunct to steroid treatment (most supporting evidence for decreased excarebations): 
     - Azathriopine 
     - Cyclophosphamide
* IVIG
* Tranfusions for anemia
During acute bleeding episode, areas of increased opacity and decreased lung volume are seen throughout the lungs, especially in the bases.
Idiopathic Pulmonary Hemosiderosis
DDX for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: 

immune related- anti-basement membrane antibody disease (Goodpasture's syndrome), vasculitis and collagen vascular disease (systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's granulomatosis, systemic necrotizing vasculitis, and others), and pulmonary capillaritis associated with idiopathic rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. 

Nonimmune-coagulopathy, necrotizing pulmonary infection, drugs (penicillamine), toxins (trimellitic anhydride), Heiner’s Syndrome, and idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis
Patient with diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis per open lung biopsy 10/07 who has been relatively asymptomatic but with persistent presence of hemosiderin-laden macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage and desaturation noted on exercise test in May 2008. 

HISTORY
Patient was product of pregnancy complicated by pre-eclampsia. Patient was born at 27weeks after 2 days of antenatal steroids. Significant respiratory distress requiring intubation was noted immediately after birth. 

Neonatal course included multiple doses of surfactant. 68 days mechanical ventilation, and 3 months of NICU care. Complications included multiple episodes of pneumonia, presumed sepsis, NEC, anemia, and electrolyte abnormalities. 

The patient was discharged home on O2 which she used until 9 months of age, as well as Fe, diuretics, steroids.

After 1 year of age, patient began to have multiple episodes of pneumonia, bronchitis, and asthma requiring hospitalization. Anemia, requiring 2 transfusions, was noted in context of one episode of pneumonia. 

In addition, the patient experienced failure to thrive, reaching less than 3% height/weight for her age.

At the present, the patient is at 25% height, 3% weight.

Parents otherwise deny recent URI, cough, wheeze.
