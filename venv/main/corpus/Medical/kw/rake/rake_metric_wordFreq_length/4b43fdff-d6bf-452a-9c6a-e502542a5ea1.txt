Standard treatment: ABVD w/XRT
Adriamycin [doxorubicin], Bleomycin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine

Prognosis is good, especially for young pts with early-stage disease 5 year survival rate of 90%
• Anterior (superior) mediastinal mass, surrounding the great vessels and aortic arch.
Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin’s Lymphoma
Mediastinal Mass:
• Thymoma 
- Most common 1° anterior mediastinal mass (20%)
• Lymphoma
• Germ Cell Tumors
• Mediastinal Cysts
• Pericardial, Bronchogenic, Enteric, Thymic
• Aneurysm of Ascending Aorta
• Thyroid/Parathyroid Tissue
A previously healthy 23 y/o woman presents with a 4-month history of itchy skin, night sweats, and a 20-lb unintentional weight loss.
• Signs & Symptoms
Often asymptomatic 
Most common = painless lymphadenopathy
1/3 of pts present w/systemic symptoms
Fatigue, generalized pruritis, “B” symptoms [low-grade fever, night sweats, weight loss]
Mediastinal masses may also produce mass effects

• Subtypes
Nodular Sclerosing
Mixed Cellularity 
Lymphocyte-Depleted
Lymphocyte-Rich
Nodular Lymphocyte-Predominant

• Nodular Sclerosing Subtype
Most common subtype in the US
Affects females > males
Median age of onset = mid-20’s

• Bimodal peak distribution of onset 
Young adults (15-35) and late adulthood (>55)
Associated with EBV and HIV
