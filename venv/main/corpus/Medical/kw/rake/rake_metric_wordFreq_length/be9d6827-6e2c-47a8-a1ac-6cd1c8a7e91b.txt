Diffuse low signal on T1 and diffuse high signal on T2 fat sat images indicating bone marrow edema of the left hip.
Transient osteoporosis of the hip.
>>Transient osteoporosis and related conditions
>>Avascular necrosis
>>Inflammatory arthropathy
>>Infection
>>Osteoid Osteoma
>>Metastasis
30 year old female 3 days postpartum with severe left hip pain.
>>Transient osteoporosis of the hip is an acute transient edema of bone marrow.
>>The differential diagnosis of bone marrow edema of the hip includes several entitities. The main diagnostic dilemma lies between avascular necrosis and transient osteoporosis of the hip. 
>>The absence of subchondral changes favors a transient condition such as transient osteoporosis.
