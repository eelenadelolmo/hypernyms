Physical exam or laboratory test results were not available.  However, these tumors are usually found incidentally on radiographs and usually are asymptomatic.  Typical physical findings, when present, are a nontender mass that grows slowly.  When patients develop pain, symptoms may result from mass effect of the tumor, particularly causing irritation and inflammation of neighboring vessels, nerve, or bursae. Pain may also result from malignant transformation to chondrosarcoma.
Treatment usually involves routine monitoring when tumors do not cause clinical problems.  If patients develop pain, then MR imaging should be done to evaluate for adjacent inflammatory changes such as bursitis and for malignant transformation. In adults, when the cartilaginous cap measures greater than 1 cm, the possibility of chondrosarcomatous transformation should be considered. In addition,  contrast-enhanced MR imaging may help differentiate  the benign osteochondroma  (enhancement usually only of the fibrovasular tissue around the cartilaginous cap) from chondrosarcoma. Typically with low grade chondrosarcoma, fibrovascular tissue between lobules enhances whereas in high grade chondrosarcoma may be more extensive.  When patients have positive MR imaging findings and  clinical symptomatology and/or when osteochondromas cause pathologic fractures, surgical resection is indicated.
Radiographs showed an osseous pedunculated mass continuous with and extending from the medullary  and cortical bone of the medial tibial metaphysis and pointing away from the joint. The mass  measures 1.1x1.16cm .  Stippled calcifications are consistent with the cartilaginous component of the lesion.
Osteochondroma
1. Peripheral osteochondroma
2. Peripheral chondrosarcoma
The patient complained of right knee pain, was evaluated at the Pain Clinic, and received Celecoxib qd for pain with variable results. The patient walked into Orthopaedics Clinic seeking further evaluation and treatment because of continuing pain in the right knee that had not resolved completely with medical management.
The characteristic radiographic findings of these tumors  are a  pedunculated or sessile mass projecting from and continuous with the metaphysis of  long bones, most frequently the tibia, femur, or humerus.  Typically, these masses point toward the diaphysis and away from the joint. Axial involvement is less common with single osteochondromas than multiple osteochondromas. On the radiographs, the cartilaginous cap appears as stippled calcifications. MR imaging confirms the  tumorâ€™s continuity with medullary and cortical bone and shows the high-signal-intensity cartilaginous cap surrounded by low-signal-intensity perichondrium.  Osteochondromas are found among all ages, although most commonly found in males less than 20 years of age.  Most are asymptomatic and found as an incidental finding.
