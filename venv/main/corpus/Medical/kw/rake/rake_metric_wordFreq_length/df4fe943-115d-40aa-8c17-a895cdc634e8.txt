Elongated (dolichocephalic) Keel-shaped skull with a palpable ridge over the sagittal suture
Cranial surgery pending
â€¢ Skull is elongated in sagittal (AP) diameter (dolichocephaly)
â€¢ Ridging along the sagittal suture line
Craniosynostosis; Scaphocephaly
â€¢ Cloverleaf skull
â€¢ Scaphocephaly
â€¢ Plagiocephaly
â€¢ Dolichocephaly
14 month old baby boy with abnormal head shape
The skull grows like the tectonic plates of the earth's crust - perpendicular to the fault lines (sutures).  When one of the faults (sutures) is closed or fused - then the skull must grow more from the remaining open sutures.
