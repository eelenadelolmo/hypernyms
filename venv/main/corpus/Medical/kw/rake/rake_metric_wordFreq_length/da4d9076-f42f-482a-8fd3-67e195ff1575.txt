Texto: 
pain distal interphalangeal joints bilaterally.
Medical management.
Degenerative joint space narrowing at the left 2nd DIP, right 2nd, 4th, 5th DIP joints with erosive component at all joints except right 2nd DIP.
Erosive Osteoarthritis
osteoarthritis, psoriasis
51 post menopausal female with hand joint pain
Erosive osteoarthritis: seen primarily in postmenopausal females.
Distribution DIP and PIP joints and 1st CMC joint and greater multangular-scaphoid joint in wrist as in primary osteoarthritis.

Distinguished from Primary osteoarthritis â€“ Erosive OA has an inflammatory component superimposed on osteoarthiritic changes.  In addition to osteophyte formation erosive disease and ankylosis can occur.  

Distinguished from psoriasis â€“ psoriasis has no osteophyte formation although late bony production can occur. Erosions are marginal whereas in erosive osteoarthritis the erosions are central.
Martel likened the appearance of psoriatic arthritic joint to that of mouse ears â€“ erosive osteoarthritis to a seagull.

The only other joints involved in erosive osteoarthritis are the IP joints of the feet. Erosions and osteophytes in any other joint in the body indicate an underlying inflammatory arthropathy with secondary osteoarthritis not erosive osteoarthritis.
