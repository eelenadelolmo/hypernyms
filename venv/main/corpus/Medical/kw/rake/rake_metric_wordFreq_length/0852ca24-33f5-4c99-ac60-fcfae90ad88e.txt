Surgery and chemotherapy
Plain films and CT show  an aggressive lytic lesion in the right humeral head and metaphysis with wide transition zone, cortical destruction, no significant periostitis, and dystrophic calcification but no significant tumor matrix.  MRI shows the mass to be enhancing.
Fibrosarcoma
Aggressive neoplasms such as malignant fibrous histiocytoma, plasmacytoma, metastasis, fibroblastic-osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma
52 yo female with right shoulder pain
Fibrosarcomas are rare aggressive tumor that tend to occur in the 3rd to 6th decade of life.  They occur equally in males and females.  They may be de novo or a secondary tumor in patients with history of Pagetâ€™s, osteonecrosis, or history of irradiation and prior chondrosarcomas.  Distribution favors metaphyseal and long tubular bones with femur(40%) and  humerus (10%).  

Radiographic appearance is as described with aggressive lytic features.  Usually little periostitis and tumor matrix is seen.  They may have pseudocapsules and if very large have necrotic areas.  

Clinically, they tend to be aggressive tumors that reoccurs and behaves much like malignant fibrous histiocytomas.

This patient under went resection and began chemotherapy.
