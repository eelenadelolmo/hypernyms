POST OP PHYSICAL EXAM:
GEN: Confused. 
VITALS: Mildly tachycardic. Otherwise unremarkable.
SKIN: Axillary petechiae. 
HEAD: CN intact. No depressed skull fracture, scalp contusions.
EXTREMITIES: Left femur status post ORIF.
Medical care is supportive in nature and includes maintenance of adequate oxygenation and ventilation, stable hemodynamics, blood products as clinically indicated, hydration, prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis and stress-related gastrointestinal bleeding, and nutrition. Steroids may be effective in shortening the clinical course.
Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images of the brain (after repair of a long bone fracture) demonstrate multiple small and diffuse T2 hyperintense foci in the subcortical deep white matter - mostly centrum semiovale - bilaterally.
Cerebral Fat Embolism
• Fat embolism syndrome (FES)
» Causes of FES - long bone Fx, liposuction, pancreatitis, burns
• ADEM
• Multiple sclerosis
• Hypertensive disease
• Dilated Vircho-Robin spaces
A 30 year old man was an unrestrained driver of an automobile who was transported to the trauma center with a femur fracture. Results of his preoperative head CT were normal. His GCS was 15 on admission.  He was taken to the operating room within 12 hours for open reduction and internal fixation of the femur fracture. Post op he was agitated and delirious.
Corticosteroids as prophylaxis for fat embolism syndrome: Several studies have demonstrated varying results using corticosteroids, usually methylprednisolone, in patients identified as being at high risk for the syndrome. Although the data appear compelling, the optimal timing, duration, and dose of steroids are undetermined (Randomized Controlled Trials of Corticosteroids in the Prevention of Fat Embolism Syndrome).
