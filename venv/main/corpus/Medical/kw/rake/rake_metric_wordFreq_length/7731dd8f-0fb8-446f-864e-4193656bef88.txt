Underweight
This patient is scheduled for an upper endoscopy with possible pneumatic dilation, which will also provide a better evaluation of the gastric cardia.
Tortuous and markedly dilated esophagus, which smoothly tapers to a beak at the GE junction. There is abnormal accumulation of contrast within the distal esophagus.  Residual food debris and secretions are present in the dilated esophagus.
Achalasia
• Achalasia
• Scleroderma
• Gastric/esophageal Carcinoma
• Peptic stricture with esophagitis
• Chagas disease
• Postvagotomy effect
62 y.o. man with dysphagia and regurgitation of solids. History of reflux.
Carcinoma of the esophagogastric region must be excluded. Most demonstrate some irregularity or mass effect although carcinoma at the gastric cardia may be smooth in appearance on upper GI. Symptoms are usually < 6 months.

Scleroderma is characterized by a dilated esophagus with patulous GE region; however, if complicated by peptic stricture may have this appearance.

Peptic strictures are commonly found with hiatal hernias, a rare occurrence with achalasia.  Peptic strictures are also rarely associated with aperistalsis.

Esophageal findings in Chagas disease would be similar to achalasia. Evaluation of other characteristic features of Chagas disease and travel history to endemic regions would aid in differentiation.
