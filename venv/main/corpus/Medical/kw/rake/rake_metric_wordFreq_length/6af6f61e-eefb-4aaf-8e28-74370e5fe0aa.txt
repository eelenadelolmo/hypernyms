Normal vital signs. Tender, erythematous, edematous, and ecchymosed right ankle.  Decreased range of motion due to pain.  Still unable to bear weight.
Treatment of the syndesmotic disruption is based on the radiographic findings.  There is a general consensus that the distal fibula needs fixed to the tibia with a syndesmotic screw placement.  However the number of screws and placement of screw is controversial. The general consensus is that the fibular fracture can be casted with out pinning.
Anteroposterior (A-P), lateral and mortise radiographs and coned down A-P radiograph of the right ankle through a plaster cast show widening of the tibiotalar and talofibular joints without evidence of cortical abnormality to any of the 3 bones.  There also appears to be widening of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis. Soft tissue swelling around the medial and lateral malleoli is also present.  Due to the plaster cast, trabecular detail may not be adequately defined.

AP and lateral radiographs of the right lower leg show a spiral fracture of the proximal third of the fibular diaphysis.  Due to the plaster cast, osseous abnormalities may be missed.

Follow-up AP and lateral radiographs of the right lower show a syndesmotic screw through the distal metaphysis of the fibula pinning it to the tibia.  There is evidence of some healing of the proximal fibular spiral fracture.
Maisonneuve fracture
Maisonneuve fracture
This is a 26 yo man who ‚Äútwisted‚Äù his right ankle while playing basketball. He stepped on another player‚Äôs foot. He was unable to walk initially due to pain and felt his ankle was very unstable.
One of the problems experienced in this case was the fact that the lower leg radiographs were not ordered at the time of the initial ankle radiographs with subsequent delay in treatment. A simple way to avoid this is the squeeze test ‚Äì squeezing the fibula against the tibia the entire length of the lower leg to demonstrate symptoms from the fibular fracture. This most likely would have been positive in this patient.
