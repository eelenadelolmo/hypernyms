Supportive.
Changes of the left distal forearm and hand consistent with history of polio (soft tissue atrophy and growth deformity) and post-polio surgical corrective changes. Osteoarthritic degenerative changes affecting the bilateral hands with the right phalanges affected more than the left phalanges.
Childhood polio and post-polio surgical corrective procedures
Initial considerations include conditions causing growth plate injury and growth arrest, such as Ollier's disease, multiple osteochondromas, polio, infection, radiation, cerebral palsy, spina bifida, trauma. Many of these can be excluded owing to lack of associated findings.
Hand pain, assess for arthritis.
