Texto: 
Somnolence and irritability.
No focal neurologic deficits.
Normal labs.
Reassurance (for hemangioma);
Routine monitoring with MRI or as symptoms dictate.
CT: Heterogeneous and hyperdense lesion of the anterior left thalamus, internal capsule and genu.  No definite calcifications identified

MR:  Lobular or somewhat "popcorn-shaped" heterogenous T1 and T2 signal mass is present in the thalamus with areas central of high T1 and a rim of very low signal on both T1 and T2 images that appears to thicken or bloom on gradient imaging.
Cavernous hemangioma (Cavernoma)
Other vascular malformation
Lymphoma
Contusion of the parenchyma - The hemosiderin ring allows you to tell it isn't acute.
CT ordered after minor traumatic incident and neurologic "deficit" warranted exam.
A "red herring" was the etiology which brought this pt to the ER for a head CT: his head had been pinned between a trailer and concrete and he exhibited initially the above Sx. This incidental finding, while classic in appearance, was unexpected in what was [otherwise] a trauma case.
