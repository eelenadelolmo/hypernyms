Complete resection is often curative, but will recur if incomplete.  Chemotherapy is used in cases of recurrence.
Diffuse encephalomalacic changes are seen in the right cerebellum secondary to a right suboccipital craniectomy.  A heterogeneous cystic and solid lesion is seen at the right cerebellopontine angle with heterogeneous contrast enhancement of a mural nodule.

This patient originally presented at the age of 3 with right facial palsy, worsening over a six month period, now undergoing routine surveillance post-resection and chemotherapy for a CNS tumor.
Tumors of the posterior fossa are the most common brain tumor in children.  They often present with symptoms of hydrocephalus (e.g. headache, vomiting and vertigo), cranial nerve or cerebellar symptoms (e.g. ataxia).  Obstruction of the fourth ventricle leading to hydrocephalus is not uncommon.  Cerebellar signs may be unilateral or axial depending on involvement of the vermis or a single hemisphere.  Astrocytomas and medulloblastomas are the most common posterior fossa tumors in children and present with similar frequency.  Ependymomas and hemangioblastomas are also commonly seen.

Astrocytomas are common in children but are not uncommon in adults.  The incidence is similar between male and female, with perhaps a slight female predominance.  Pilocytic astrocytomas are, by definition, low-grade (WHO grade I) tumors.  They are well circumscribed lesions and may be cystic, solid or both.  The cystic form is seen in greater than 75% of lesions and has a classic appearance of a mural nodule in a cyst.  With MRI, the mural tumor appears iso- or hypointense on T1-weighted images and iso- to hyperintense on T2-weight images.  The cyst wall does not consist of tumor cells and thus will not enhance on CT or MRI.  Complete resection is often curative, however solid tumors may not be as amenable to resection if the fourth ventricle is involved.

Medulloblastoma, a primitive neuroectodermal tumor, is rare in adulthood, most commonly occurring between ages 5 and 15 with a 2:1 male predominance.  These highly malignant tumors usually arise in the midline in the posterior fossa (85%).  Medulloblastoma appears hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2 and enhances with contrast.  It may appear well-circumscribed but is often found to be invasive at the margins on histology, often invades the fourth ventricle and will seed the subarachnoid space â€“ necessitating surveillance of the spinal cord.  Death usually comes within months if not treated.  Resection, chemotherapy and radiation can extend life, with 60-75% survival at five years.

Hemangioblastomas are benign, low-grade (WHO grade I) tumors that are associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease, but also occur in isolation.  They have a very similar appearance on MRI to astrocytomas, consisting of a cyst with mural module, but may also be solid or multiple with von Hippel-Lindau.  The mural nodule enhances and has classic flow and enhancement features on angiography.  As with pilocytic astrocytoma complete resection is often curative, however recurrence is not uncommon.

Ependymomas most commonly arise in the floor of the fourth ventricle.  This is a malignant tumor that can spread throughout the ventricular system.  This mass can be differentiated from the others discussed here as it often has calcifications on CT.  Complete resection is rarely achievable, but these are usually radiosensitive.  On MRI, ependymomas may appear as multiple small cysts that enhance with contrast.

MRI is the leading diagnostic and surveillance modality for posterior fossa tumors.  It provides greater detail of the lesion and has been shown to be more sensitive and specific than CT.  Although pediatric patients are more frequently sedated for MRI studies, there is no radiation and no iodinated contrast as with CT
