Stool Occult Blood positive, fecal leukocytes present, WBC within normal limits, H pylori Ab negative, TTG IgA negative.  CEA positive
Surgical removal of adenocarcinoma with colostomy placed.  Surgical course was complicated with C diff infection post operatively.  Chemotherapy with 5-FU + leucovorin + oxaliplatin (FLOFOX) initiated soon afterwards.  Plan to reverse colostomy after chemotherapy completed.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis with contrast: Development of at least a partial large bowel obstruction proximal to a focal segment of inflamed, thickened sigmoid colon.
Stage III T3N1 (1 of 22 Lymph Node Positive) adenocarinoma of sigmoid colon
Crohnâ€™s, diverticulitis, neoplasia
26 y/o M who originally presented to outpatient clinic with 1 month of LLQ pain and subjective fevers, chills, and loose stools.  Pt endorsed 30lb weight loss in past 2 months.
Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in U.S. men and women and is the second leading cause of cancer death overall.  It is very rare under the age of 40, with 90% of cases occurring after the age of 50.  Approximately 50% arise in the rectum, 25% in the sigmoid colon, and 25% throughout the remainder of the colon.  Clinical manifestations of distal colon cancer include change in bowel habits, obstruction, colicky abdominal pain, hematochezia and weight loss.  Screening should be performed starting at age 50 and repeat every 10 years with colonoscopy for average risk individuals.  Those with a positive family history of colon cancer or those with a history of inflammatory bowel disease are at an increased risk and may require earlier and or more frequent screening.
