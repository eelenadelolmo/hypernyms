Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in U.S. men and women and is the second leading cause of cancer death overall.  It is very rare under the age of 40, with 90% of cases occurring after the age of 50.  Approximately 50% arise in the rectum, 25% in the sigmoid colon, and 25% throughout the remainder of the colon.  Clinical manifestations of distal colon cancer include change in bowel habits, obstruction, colicky abdominal pain, hematochezia and weight loss.  Screening should be performed starting at age 50 and repeat every 10 years with colonoscopy for average risk individuals.  Those with a positive family history of colon cancer or those with a history of inflammatory bowel disease are at an increased risk and may require earlier and or more frequent screening.
