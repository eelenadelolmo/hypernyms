8 year old female with a history of hypothyroidism and severe short stature.  She has been lost to follow-up for three years but was restarted on Synthroid three months ago.  Now she is being seen by endocrinologist for short stature.

Endocrine abnormalities are common; in this case, the patient presented with signs and symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism and growth hormone deficiency.
