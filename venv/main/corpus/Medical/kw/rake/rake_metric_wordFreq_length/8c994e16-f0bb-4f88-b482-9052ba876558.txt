This patient was treated with pain medications to control the pain from the rib fracture and decrease splinting. She was prescribed Soma and Percocet. Incentive spirometry was given for atelectasis. She was treated conservatively for the rest of her pain and soreness, with rest, chiropractic adjustment, and massage therapy. 

She will follow up with a repeat mammogram and US in 3-4 weeks to evaluate whether she is demonstrating good absorption versus fibrosis, seroma, calcifications, and/or fat necrosis.

Further imaging of the areas of differential diagnosis are to be done by MRI.   Rib fracture and breast hematoma are two common sequelae of motor vehicle accidents, making these much more likely based on the clinical picture. Multiple rib fractures were confirmed by their presence on CT scan. Breast hematoma was confirmed by physical exam, mammography and ultrasound evidence.
The patient is a 54 year-old soman who was involved in a vehicular accident.  She reports that at this time she was a restrained driver of a vehicle which was stopped. She was struck from behind by another vehicle going approximately 40mph, causing her to strike her chest on the steering wheel. She felt as if she were “having a heart attack” from the pain in her chest and needed help to exit the vehicle. Airbags did not deploy. She denies any LOC or blood loss. She was taken by ambulance to the hospital at which time she noticed severe hematomas developed across her right breast. At the hospital, fracture of the 6th  rib on the right was noted and she was prescribed Percocet and Tylenol for pain control. 

Following this episode, the patient reports pain in her breasts, neck, middle back, right ribs, chest, lower back, as well as headaches. She reports some numbness in her right upper extremity. She denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of bowel/bladder control, photophobia, phonophobia, dizziness, syncope.

This patient has a past medical history of plantar fasciitis, chronic sinus problems, endometriosis, hepatitis C. She had a hysterectomy in 2012-2013. She denies any previous vehicular accidents, falls, athletic episodes wherein an injury was sustained to her neck or back.

Rib fractures as well as breast hematomas are most commonly caused by blunt chest trauma. The chest wall protects underlying internal organs by surrounding them with hard osseous structures including the ribs, clavicles, sternum, and scapulae. In addition, normal respiration requires an intact chest wall; rib fractures may compromise ventilation by a variety of mechanisms. Pain from rib fractures can cause respiratory splinting due to painful inspiration, resulting in sequelae such as atelectasis and pneumonia. Interestingly, the hospital radiographic evaluation only identified an old rib fracture of the sixth rib.  However, the doctor of chiropractic ordered a CT scan to further evaluate the possibility of further rib fracture and breast hematoma.  In this case, the patient did show bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis on CT. She was treated appropriately with incentive spirometry and pain medications to decrease splinting and improved with these treatments.  Following the CT scan the doctor of chiropractic worked with the PCP to order breast ultrasound studies that were inconclusive for hematoma but were helpful in evaluation the size of the lesions.  Such was then followed by mammography.

Multiple adjacent rib fractures (ie, flail chest) interfere with normal costovertebral and diaphragmatic muscle excursion, potentially causing ventilatory insufficiency. Fragments of fractured ribs can also penetrate surrounding organs, resulting in a hemothorax or a pneumothorax. Fortunately, this patient did not have any of these more serious sequelae.

This patient had trauma to the right breast from the force of her seat belt. When leaked blood accumulates in a fluid collection, at first it clots. Over time, the blood separates into a yellow fluid (which is the “serum” component of blood), and the solid fibrin component of a blood clot. Mild breast hematomas often resolve on their own within several days to weeks by means of reabsorption. Larger, more severe hematomas are more likely to lead to inflammation or fibrosis. When a hematoma resolves, it may become fibrotic, leaving behind scar tissue. It may also liquify to form a seroma. Ultimately, fat necrosis may occur in this region of the breast as well as diffuse calcifications. Myositis ossificans is a benign disorder in which non-neoplastic bone and cartilage form after trauma causing severe muscular contusion or hematoma. When a hematoma occurs, it creates an osmotic gradient for several days, causing fluid to be drawn into the area of the hematoma with resultant swelling. One postulated mechanism by which myositis ossificans occurs is inflammation of the muscular tissue after trauma, with infiltration of fibroblasts into the area within 3-4 days. Fibroblasts then differentiate into osteoblasts which produce osteoid becoming radiologically visible in 4-6 months. Maturation of the lesion takes place in 4-6 months. If a lesion does not decrease in size and tenderness following 4-5 days of conservative management, one should suspect the development of myositis ossificans, as is indicated in this patient. 

 These are all possibilities in this patient, who has a large and moderately severe hematoma. Future radiographic studies (mammography and ultrasonography) will reveal whether she is demonstrating good absorption versus fibrosis, seroma, calcifications, and/or fat necrosis.
