Physical exam revealed a non-tender thyroid gland with a non-tender palpable right thyroid nodules. 

PREOPERATIVE:
TSH = 160 mgIU/mL
FT4 = 14.3 ng/dL
RAIU: 13.8%

POST-THYROIDECTOMY:
TSH = 77.25mg/mL
FT4 = 0.06ng/mL
RAIU = 2.7%
Thyroid biopsy revealed follicular thyroid cancer.  The patient underwent thyroidectomy.  Post surgical thyroid scintigraphy revealed residual thyroid avid tissue in the thyroid bed and ablation with high dose I (131) was administered.
PREOPERATIVE thyroid nuclear scan was performed:  
I (131) 7.7 microcurie was administered 24 hours prior to imaging and measurement of the radioactive uptake was 13.8% (normal 8% - 30%). On the day of imaging technetium 99m-pertechnetate 11.0 millicurie was administered thyroid imaging revealed a photopenic region in the lateral aspect of the right thyroid gland.  The findings consistent with a cold thyroid nodule. 

POST-THYROIDECTOMY 1(123) scan demonstrated residual thyroid activity in the thyroid bed with no evidence of extrathyroidal malignancy.  I (131) ablation therapy followed with a 185 millicurie dose.

Patient presents for screening carotid ultrasound and a 3cm solitary right thyroid nodule was incidentally discovered.  The patient denied symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.
Pre- total thyroidectomy: 
A very low dose of I (131), which has a suboptimal imaging  gamma emission of 364 keV, a longer half life of 8 days, and is a cytotoxic beta minus emitter is used for the pre surgical radioactive uptake (RAIU) measurement. Thyroid cancers typically have normal RAIU.  Technetium-99m-pertechnate has an optimal imaging gamma emmission of 140 keV, a shorter half life of 8 hours, and has no cytotoxic beta emissions .   


Post thyroidectomy and preablation: 
Identifying residual thyroid advid tissue within the thyroid bed and beyond prior to ablation.  I123 has an optimal imaging gamma emission of 159keV, a half life of 13.27 hours, and no cytotoxic beta emissions.   Neck and pin-hole thyroid as well as whole body anterior and posterior planar images allow identification of iodine avid tissue in and beyond the thyroid bed. In preparation for ablation, the patient is hypothyroid secondary to hormone replacement medication withdrawl or is placed on thyrogen (recombinant TSH) which prevents hypothyroid symptoms.  Ablations dose is determined by the presence of absence of metastatic disease and tumor pathology.    

Post ablation:
Follow up thyroid scintigraphy is performed up to 10 days but not earlier than 5-6 days post ablation to identify metastatic disease and again between six to twelve month to identify residual or recurrent disease.  

The patients thyroglobulin levels are monitored and they are placed on hormone replacement therapy.
