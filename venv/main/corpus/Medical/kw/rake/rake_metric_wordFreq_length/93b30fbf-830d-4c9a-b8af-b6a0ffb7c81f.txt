L-Spine Films #1-#2
      #1:  L2-L5 with increasing density.  Many osteophytes.  Surgical clips in pelvic inlet consistent with prostatectomy.  No fractures.  Bones aligned.  
     #2:  Lateral:  L2-L5 with increasing density. Osteophytes throughout.

C-Spine Films #3-PA, #4-lateral, #5-odontoid
C2 & C3 are sclerotic.  Anterior osteophytes at C3, C5 & C6.  C5 with decreased vertebral body height.  Disk spaces are maintained.  
#5 odontoid - has increased antlantoaxial joint space on right.
Metastatic Prostate Cancer (blastic)
Blastic bone metastasis:
breast
prostate
lymphoma
carcinoid
rarely PNET (medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, children)
69 yo man presents with lower back pain & neck pain.  He had a total prostatectomy two years earlier.  Post-op followup PSA  was 17; and, two months later, PSA has risen to 39.   No other history is available.
Video for this Case = http://youtu.be/T2KtPKMpCrM

Blastic bone lesions are produced when the balance between osteoclasts and osteoblasts is shifted toward bone production.  Lytic bone metastases are created by a shift favoring ostoclasts.  Metastatic deposits do not directly destroy bone.
