Texto: 
Alert mental status.  Limited mobility.
Routine monitoring of head CT and shunt series to evaluate for hydrocephalus and intact shunt.
VP shunt tubing seen in the right upper quadrant (other images demonstrate it is intact throughout its course).

Incomplete fusion of the posterior elements of L5 and S1 (partially post-surgical sequelae).

Bilateral right greater than left hip dysplasia.
Chiari II malformation
Chiari II malformation (with history of myelomeningocele
Developmental hip dysplasia
15 yo male, history withheld, for routine follow up.
A 15 year old male with Chiari II malformation.  Early surgical correction of myelomeningocele and shunt placement for hydrocephalus has done well, but has limited mobility of the lower extremities.
