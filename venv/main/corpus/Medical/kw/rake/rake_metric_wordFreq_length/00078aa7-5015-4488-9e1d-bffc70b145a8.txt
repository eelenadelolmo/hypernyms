Unremarkable physical exam.
Therapuetic INR - Coumadin for Atrial fibrillation.
None required.  However, azygous continuation of the IVC can be surgically hazardous anatomy and should be included in radiology reports.  The azygous vein should be used if patients require a filter for lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
1. No airspace disease.  Mild cardiomegaly. Curvilinear opacity which extends over the right mainstem bronchus in the expected location of the azygous vein.

2. Large tubular structure with refluxed contrast which extends from the superior vena cava along the right side of the spine along a course paralleling the aorta into the abdomen where it crosses over to the left side.  The inferior vena cava is absent below the level of the liver.
Azygous Continuation of the Inferior Vena Cava
Azygous continuation of the IVC
Azygous dilation secondary to obstruction of the IVC
54 year-old woman with chest pain. History of Atrial fibrillation.
