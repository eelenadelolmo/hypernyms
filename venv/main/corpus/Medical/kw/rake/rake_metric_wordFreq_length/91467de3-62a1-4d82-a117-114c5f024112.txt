TTP in the anatomical snuff box.
Splinting in position of function along with orthopedic consultation.  Given the absence of apparent displacement, splinting will likely be sufficient to allow for complete healing.
Unremarkable frontal view of the wrist (other views not shown).  On coronal T1 MR, a low-signal-intensity horizontal line is present in the trapezium.  An additional non-linear focal region of T1 hypointensity is seen in the lateral aspect of the scaphoid.  On coronal T2 MR images, correlative regions of T2 hyperintensity are seen within the mid trapezium and the radial aspect of the scaphoid.
Trapezium Fracture (Occult)
Scaphoid Contusion
1. Occult Trapezium Fracture
2. Occult Scaphoid Contusion
22 y/o male with wrist pain s/p fall and TTP in the anatomical snuff box.  R/O scaphoid fracture.
As the trapezium forms the distal portion of the anatomical snuff box, TTP may be present on exam which can lead to a pre-MR diagnosis of occult scaphoid fracture.  In this case, there is post-traumatic edema/contusion but no fracture in the scaphoid.
