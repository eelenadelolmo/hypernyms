Discharged in good condition.
There is a previous slipped capital femoral epiphysis on the left with sclerosis.  The alpha angle on the left is 75 degrees.  There is mild joint space narrowing on left anterior with sclerosis and cystic change (anterior acetabulum).  A small osteophyte is present extending from the anterolateral aspect of acetabulum.

A 15 year old girl presents with pain in the left hip for the last 4 ‚Äì 5 days.  She has a history of SCFE on the right hip which had been repaired 3 years ago.  She says the pain is not the same as the SCFE, and that her left hip is ‚Äújust hanging there.‚Äù  It does not hurt when there is no weight bearing on it.
