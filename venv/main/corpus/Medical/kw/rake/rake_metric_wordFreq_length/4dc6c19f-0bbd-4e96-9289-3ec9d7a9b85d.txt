There are many different treatment choices for Kienbockâ€™s disease depending on the stage of the disease the patient is at.   In this case Kienbock's appeared to be at an early stage.  He was immobilized.  MRI evaluation was obtained following radiographic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis.  The patient was set up with an orthopedic surgeon who adminstered corticosteroid injection for the tendonopathy on the left wrist.  The treating Doctor of Chiropractic felt that a second opinion would be useful.  He was evaluated by a wrist orthopedic specialist who confirmed the diagnosis of Kienbock's and agreed with the concept of immobilization.  Such immobilization will occur over the next month with re-evaluation and repeat radiographs.
Xray
There is no fracture, or dislocation of any of the skeletal structures. There are mild degenerative changes at the lunate capitate articulation. There is increased density at the distal end of the lunate bone. 
MRI
There is increased signal of the lunate bone; the bone appears to be sclerotic distally. There is no fracture seen. There are some osteophytes at the space between the lunate and the capitate.
Kienbock's disease.
1. ulno-carpal impaction syndrome
2. intraosseous synovial cyst
3.transitory lunate ischemia after dislocation
4. fresh lunate fracture
Patient is 63yo male pedestrian involved in a motor vehicle crash approximately 2 and 1/2 month ago. His left hand directly hit the car's mirror and he fell down with both hands out-stretched. He was admitted to the hospital for 6hr's. X-ray was performed and it did not show any fracture. 

Patient presented complaining of wrist pain and swelling of both hands and wrists, but it was worse on the left side. The patient symptoms continued to exist from the day of his accident. His pain increases with hand movement. He stated that he sometimes has numbness, and tingling on all fingers on the left side only. 

He stated that he never experienced any trauma to his wrist in the past, and he didn't have surgeries to his hands in the past. He continues to take Lortab for the pain every 6hr's, and it decreases his pain for short time. According to the patient the pain in his wrist and hand decreased his daily function.
