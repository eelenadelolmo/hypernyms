Axial contrast enhanced CT image through the level of the heart demonstrates a large mediastinal mass that appears to be a conglomeration of masses with heterogeneous appearance and enhancement.  The mass displaces the heart to the right and compresses the left mainstem bronchus.  A pericardial effusion is also present.  Supraclavicular lymphandenopathy (not shown) was present as well. There is left lung atelectasis and a left pleural effusion.
