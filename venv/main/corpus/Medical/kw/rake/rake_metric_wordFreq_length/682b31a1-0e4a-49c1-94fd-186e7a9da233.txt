Urinary bladder stones are crystalline masses that form within the lumen of the urinary bladder.  Approximately 95% of all bladder stones occur in men, and risk factors may include foreign body or infectious material within the urinary bladder (that may act as a nidus), hyperconcentrated urine, and a poorly emptying urinary bladder (as might be seen with a neurogenic bladder or benign prostatic hypertrophy - BPH).  

Most urinary bladder stones are composed of calcium oxalate or struvite;  however, patients with gout may develop bladder stones composed almost entirely of uric acid (common in Asia).

Bladder stones are generally much less common than kidney stones.  Symptoms occur when the stone irritates the lining of the bladder or obstructs the flow of urine from the bladder.  Treatment may include observation, cystoscopic removal of smaller stones, lithotripsy, and surgical removal of larger bladder stones.

Note that bladder stones are somewhat common in dogs and cats [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_stone_(animal)]
