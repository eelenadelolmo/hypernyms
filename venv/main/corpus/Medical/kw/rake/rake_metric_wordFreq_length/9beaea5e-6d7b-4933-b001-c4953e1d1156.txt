Non-tender, non-distended abdominal and pelvic exam.  No adnexal tenderness.  Normal WBC count.  Stable H&H.  Quantitative hCG of 909 IU/L.
Surgical treatment with periodic follow-up evaluations until quantitative hCG returned to zero.
Transvaginal grayscale and color flow ultrasound evaluation of the pelvis demonstrates a moderate amount of free fluid in pelvic cul-de-sac.  No gestational sac is seen within the endometrium.  There is a heterogeneous mass anterior to right ovary with adjacent complex fluid.
Ectopic Pregnancy

27y/o G0P0 white female with 24 hours of abdominal “queeziness.”  Last menstrual period 2 weeks ago, but “lighter than usual.”
Ectopic pregnancy if defined by the implantation of a fertilized ovum outside the  endometrial lining of the uterus, most commonly within the fallopian tube (95-97%).  The incidence of ectopic pregnancy increased throughout the 1970’s and 80’s, presumably secondary to the increased rate of pelvic inflammatory disease.  The associated mortality rate decreased following this rise in incidence, because of increased awareness and earlier detection.

The classic triad of ectopic pregnancy consists of irregular bleeding, abdominal/pelvic pain, and a tender adnexal mass.  Only 60% of cases have a missed menstral period.  Signs and symptoms can present early, secondary to mass effect on the small caliber fallopian tube.  High risk groups include females with abnormal fallopian tubes from prior infection, developmental defects, or prior surgery, having an IUD in place, in vitro fertilization, and a prior history of ectopic pregnancy.  This patient presented with irregular bleeding, but without pain or tenderness.  She had none of the above-described risk factors.

Above a quantitative hCG level of 1500-2000 IU/L, an intrauterine pregnancy should be visualized on transvaginal ultrasound, if present.  This level is called the discriminatory zone.  The discriminatory zone for transabdominal ultrasound evaluation is higher, at 6500 IU/L.   A negative ultrasound examination at hCG levels below the discriminatory zone is consistent with an early viable intrauterine pregnancy or an ectopic pregnancy or nonviable intrauterine pregnancy.  Because this patient’s clinical examination was fairly benign and the quantitative hCG was below the discriminatory zone, the clinician elected to delay surgical or medical treatment for ectopic pregnancy at this initial evaluation.  The patient returned for follow-up examination in 48 hours with an unchanged clinical picture and a quantitative hCG level of 1217 IU/L.  Because the hCG level was not rising at the predicted rate for a normal IUP, laproscopic surgical intervention was performed at that time.  Subsequent follow-up examinations were performed until the quantitative hCG levels returned to zero.  Ectopic pregnancy was confirmed by histopathologic evaluation.

A complex adnexal mass in the presence of a quantitative hCG level above the discriminatory zone and empty uterus is highly suggestive of an extrauterine gestation and is the most common sonographic abnormality, these findings should be considered to represent ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise.  Nonspecific findings that should heighten a clinician's suspicion of ectopic pregnancy include the visualization of a fluid filled adnexal mass surrounded by an echogenic ring (bagel sign) and free fluid in the peritoneal cavity/cul-de-sac.
