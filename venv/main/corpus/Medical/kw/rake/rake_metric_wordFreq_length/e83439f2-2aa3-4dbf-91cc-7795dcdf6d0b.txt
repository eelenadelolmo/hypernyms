Focal area of heterogeneous echotexture in the region of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle which demonstrates enlargement.  There is a hypo-echoic rim around a hyper-echoic lesion with mass like appearance.  Real time sonography demonstrates that the lesion moves synchronously with the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
