Physical Exam and Laboratory: 
General: Well appearing adolescent male in no acute distress
Skin:       No rashes
HEENT:   MMM, anicteric. alopecia
Neck:     Supple with no significant LAD
Chest:    Clear to auscultation bilaterally
Heart:    RRR without murmurs/rubs/gallops
Abd:       Soft, nontender, nondistended, no HSM,
Extr:      Mild diffuse swelling of left thigh, nontender on palpation.
GU         Bilaterally descended testes with no masses
Neuro:   Normal
Chemotherapy (vincristine, doxorubicin, cytoxan, ifosphamide, and etoposide) and radiation
Figure 1= Left Femur lateral view:
Soft tissue mass of the distal anterolateral left thigh with cortical involvement of the posterolateral left femoral diaphysis, no evidence of soft tissue calcification, or osteoid matrix
Figure 2= Whole body bone scan:
Increased radionuclide uptake within the distal left thigh
Figure 3-5= Left Femur MRI with and without contrast:
Large mass within the distal left thigh replacing the muscle bellies of the vastus intermedius and biceps femoris with extension into the marrow cavity of the distal femur, consistent with known Ewing sarcoma.  
Figure 6-7 = Axial CT and T1 MRI of the pelvis.  There is evidence of metastatic disease to the left iliac chain lymph nodes.
