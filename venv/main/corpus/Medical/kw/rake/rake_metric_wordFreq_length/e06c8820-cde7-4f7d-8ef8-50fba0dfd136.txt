Low back stiffness.
The disease should be discussed in detail with the patient.  Treatment includes a regular exercise regimen to maintain mobility.  NSAIDs can be used to help with pain and mobility.  Extensive pain or disability due to spine or hip involvement may require surgery.

Ankylosis of the facet joints of the spine. Bridging syndesmophytes are seen at all levels. There is squaring of the vertebral bodies with increased density at the corners. There has been ankylosis of the sacroiliac joints bilaterally. The paravertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.

Ankylosing Spondylitis
Reactive Arthritis - ankylosis and syndesmophytes too extensive and symmetrical for reactive arthritis
43 year-old active duty man with chronic low back pain, now worse over the last 3 weeks.  No prior imaging.
This is an interesting patient with a history of chronic pain and stiffness, but no prior imaging or clinical suspicion for Ankylosing Spondylitis.  The imaging characteristic are diagnostic.
