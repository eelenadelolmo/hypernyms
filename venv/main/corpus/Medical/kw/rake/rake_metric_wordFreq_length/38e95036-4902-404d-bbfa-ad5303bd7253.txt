Opsoclonus and myoclonus.
Excision.
• Limited brain ultrasound (at time of normal abdominal ultrasound) demonstrates large echogenic midline suprasellar mass with marked hydrocephalus of lateral ventricles.

• Head CT with and without contrast shows large, vascular suprasellar mass extending into frontal and middle cranial fossae, marked hydrocephalus lateral ventricles, and right middle cranial fossa cystic mass - probably arachnoid cyst.

• MRI brain shows large suprasellar mass (T1 intermediate, T2 bright, heterogeneous enhancement) greatest dimension 7.3cm; obstructive hydrocephalus bilateral lateral ventricles with transependymal edema; splaying of circle of willis arteries; mass surrounding, narrowing, stretching RT ACA.  Large arachnoid cyst right middle cranial fossa.
Pilomyxoid Astrocytoma (PMA)
• Arachnoid Cyst - perhaps unrelated to mass
• Pilomyxoid astrocytoma
• Teratomatous tumor
• Malignant hypothalamic glioma
• Germinoma
• Atypical craniopharyngioma
14 month old baby boy presented with failure to thrive, opsoclonus and myoclonus.  Concern was for possible neuroblastoma and paraneoplastic syndrome.  Abdominal ultrasound was ordered.
