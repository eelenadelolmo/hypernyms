FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS #1:  MENINGIOMA.

DESCRIPTION OF SPECIMEN:

A: CUSA contents
B: Epidural mass invading periosteum of skull
C: Skull bone
D: Tumor

GROSS DESCRIPTION
Four specimens are received. Specimen A is received in formalin labeled CUSA contents and consists of 400 ml of brown fluid. The specimen is strained to reveal multiple brown tan hemorrhagic fragments of soft tissue which measure 1.5 x 1 x 0.8 cm in aggregate. The entire specimen is submitted in screened A1.

Specimen B is received fresh for frozen section then is placed in formalin.

The specimen is labeled epidermal mass invading periosteum of skull. It consists of two red white soft tissue fragments which measure 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.1 cm and 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm respectively. A squash prep is made and the 
specimen is entirely frozen as FS1. FS1 is entirely submitted in B1.

Specimen C is received fresh and placed in formalin labeled skull bone and consists of an irregular shaped fragment of bone measuring 8.0 x 9.0 x 1.0 cm.  In the center of the specimen there is an elevation measuring 3.5 cm and 
has a blue tinge.  Representative section is submitted in C1 for decal.

Specimen D is received in formalin labeled tumor and consists of a white tan fragment of soft tissue which appears to be a membrane and measures 6 x 2.5 x 0.2 cm. There is one area of the membrane which has white tan friable 
material. This area measures 2 x 1 x 0.3 cm. There are also multiple fragments of soft tissue which are brown tan and hemorrhagic and measure 1 x 1 x 1 cm in aggregate. The fragment of tissues which were received were entirely submitted in screened D1. The friable area and a representative section of normal appearing membrane are submitted in screened D2.


MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION/COMMENT
Specimens A1, B1, C1 (decal), D1 and D2 contain a highly cellular neoplasm.  The tumor is growing in sheets invading dura and bone.  In some areas it has whorls and in other areas it does not.  No psammoma bodies are found.  Much of the tumor has a meningotheliomatous appearance.  However, other segments have larger cells with more prominent nucleoli.  Small foci of necrosis are found in the tumor and apoptotic nuclei are present especially in specimen D1 and D2.  In D2 there is a segment of necrotic tumor and a central area where the cytoplasm of the cells are more eosinophilic.  This is surrounded by a streaming band of closely packed more blue staining neoplasm.  This area does not have an increase in connective tissue or reticulin.  The MIB-1 immunostain shows an index of 3-4% in the streaming band of tumor and in another similar area.

Note:  The presence of a higher turnover rate, the zones of necrosis and the moderate atypia make this a WHO grade II, atypical meningioma.

Addendum Comment

The trichrome and reticulin   stains were performed on block D2 to determine if a sarcomatous component of the neoplasm was developing.  The streaming band of the dark  cells did not contain collagen or reticulin.
