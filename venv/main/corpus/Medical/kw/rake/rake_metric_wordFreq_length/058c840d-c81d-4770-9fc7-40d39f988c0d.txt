Genitourinary: 5cm x 3cm testicular mass on the right side that is firm and approximately Tanner stage 3. No inguinal lymphadenopathy appreciated.

Labs: 
Beta-HCG â€“ Negative
Alpha-fetoprotein - Negative
After the initial suspicion for a testicular mass was confirmed on the testicular ultrasound with an increased suspicion for a testicular epidermoid cyst, the urologist chose to do a biopsy of the lesion. When the histopathology showed benign testicular epidermoid cyst, local excision of the cyst was performed. Sparing of right testicle was possible due to the benign nature of the mass. Patient had a post-op UTI, which cleared up quickly after the initiation of antibiotics. Since the surgery, patient has been getting testicular ultrasound at regular intervals with the encouragement of self-exam. There has been no recurrence of the mass in the last 5 years.
Summary of Image Findings:

-	Mass in the right testicle measuring approximately 1.4cm in its greatest diameter. The echo pattern appears inhomogeneous with a suggestion of layers and focal areas of echogenicity that shadow, thus suggesting calcifications (Image 1).
-	Minimal to no blood flow within the mass as indicated by the Doppler (Image 2).
Testicular Epidermoid Cyst
1.	Testicular epidermoid cyst
2.	Germ cell tumor such as teratoma
3.	Seminomatous tumor
4.	Hematoma with calcification
Painless, right-sided testicular mass noted by the patient during a shower
In this patient presenting with a painless testicular mass, the differential diagnosis list could be fairly extensive prior to ultrasound imaging. The ultrasound image showed an intraparenchymal mass with a cystic interior as opposed to a solid mass. The fact that the interior of the cyst was not anechoic helps rule out a simple cyst. Also, the lack of blood flow on Doppler helps rule out both a hematoma as well as an abscess which resembles a cystic appearing mass. In this case, patient had the more delineating target appearance on the ultrasound. Thus, testicular epidermoid cyst was strongly suggested based on the radiologic diagnosis. The suggestion of calcifications on the ultrasound clouds the picture by adding teratoma to the differential.
