Normal variant

The images are from an MR arthrogram, where a combination of iodinated and gadolinium based contrast material is injected into the joint prior to MR imaging.  The iodinated contrast is so the correct location is confirmed on fluoroscopy prior to sending the patient to the MRI Suite.
