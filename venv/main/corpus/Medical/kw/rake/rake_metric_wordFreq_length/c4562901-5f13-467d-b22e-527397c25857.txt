Image 1: Lateral view of the right knee from Jan, 2003: total knee arthroplasty with radiopaque material in the joint, predominantly in the patellofemoral component. Metallic back of the patellar prosthesis is loosened and is located inferior to patella.

Image 2: Lateral view of the right knee from Aug, 2001: total knee arthroplasty with no evidence of complication. Note the normal location of the metallic back of the patellar prosthesis.
Metallosis secondary to loosening of metallic back of patellar prosthesis of total knee arthroplasty, confirmed intraoperatively during arthroplasty revision.
- Arthroplasty failure with metallosis
- Other foreign body
- Hemarthrosis with dystrophic calcification
- Chondrocalcinosis
