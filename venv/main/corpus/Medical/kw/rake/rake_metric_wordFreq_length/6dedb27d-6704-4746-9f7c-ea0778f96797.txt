Texto: 
TSH  <0.01 uIU/ML	(0.34-4.82)
Free T4  >3.66 ng/dL 	(0.77-1.61)
TSI not available, but reportedly positive
Radioactive Iodine Uptake (RAIU) of 85%

Physical examination demonstrated no focal nodularity, and only mild enlargement of a non-tender thyroid gland.
Patient will be treated with 15mCi of I-131.
Homogenous, diffusely increased uptake within the thyroid gland (including within a pyramidal lobe), with relatively diminished salivary gland activity.

24 hour RAIU = 85%
Graves' Disease
Given the clinical history and laboratory data, the observed 24 hour RAIU and scan, are consistent with Graves' disease.
46yo woman with family history of Graves' disease, and recent development of ophthalmopathy.
