Obvious deformity of left femur
Vitamin D supplementation
Transverse fracture of the mid-left femur with apex-anterior angulation.  An important additional finding is marked lucency, widening fraying, and cupping of the metaphyses.
Rickets
1. Fracture of the left femur, likely an insufficiency fracture due to underlying osteomalacia.
2. Rickets (multiple causes of osteomalacia, including Vitamin D deficiency, end organ resistance, and renal failure), multifocal osteomyelitis, leukemia, neuroblastoma mets.
Leg pain
Rickets is a manifestation of osteomalacia, or failure of mineralization of bone.  Causes include nutritional deficiency, impaired absorption, renal failure, and renal tubular acidosis.  Two types: infantile: <2 yo, characterized by bowing of long bones, wide growth plates, cupped and frayed metaphyses.  A classic finding is the rachitic rosary â€“ enlarged cartilage at osteo-chondral junction of the anterior ribs.  The Vitamin-D resistant type usually presents >2 yo and is characterized by marked bowing of extremities with possible sclerosis.
