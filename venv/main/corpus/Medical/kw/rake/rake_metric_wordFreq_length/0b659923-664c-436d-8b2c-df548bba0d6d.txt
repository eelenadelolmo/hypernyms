Texto: 
• Confused and combative, obviously intoxicated.
• L. hemiparesis with slight L. hyperreflexia

NOTE: All of your scanners are having a PACS software security patch - they are all temporarily out of service.
Surgical drainage with complete recovery post-operatively.
Selective external carotid catheter angiogram shows:
1) active extravasation of contrast
2) displacement of vessels away from the inner table of the skull
Acute epidural hematoma, bleeding meningeal artery
• Epidural hematoma
• Dural A-V Fistula
• Subdural hematoma
24 y.o. man, after heavy alcohol intake, fell from a barstool, striking his head on the floor.  He was only unconscious for one minute - but awoke amnestic for the event.
Before we had CT and MR - non-invasive imaging - intracranial mass lesions were identified, localized, and often diagnosed using invasive methods, such as the angiogram used for this patient.  The displacement of the meningeal arteries nicely demonstrates the classic "bi-convex" shape of an epidural hematoma - as well as showing the bleeding meningeal artery.
