As the patient was experiencing cough and dyspnea, the pleural effusion was drained multiple times using fluoroscopy before he could be sent safely for biopsy. Imaging directly after the first attempt at draining the pleural effusion is shown, with little improvement despite taking off about 3L of fluid. Multiple attempts were needed to fully drain the effusion.

Following stabilization, biopsy and histological diagnosis, he was placed on COG protocol AHOD0831 for high-risk Hodgkin"s lymphoma. He received induction and consolidation chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, etoposide, cyclophosphamide and prednisone. He then received 14 sessions of focused mediastinal radiation.

He has since been followed up every month with CT scans every 3 months which have shown improving residual adenopathy. It is now about one year and two months post-diagnosis and he has had no recurrence of disease.
CXR: The left hemithorax is almost completely opacified and shows a small amount of aerated lung at the left hilum. There is also evidence of lymphadenopathy.

CT: Massive adenopathy of anterior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes extending anterior to the heart. Retrosternal lymph node mass measuring 5.8cm at maximal diameter. Bilateral enlarged cervical lymph nodes measuring 4cm at maximal diameter and one enlarged axillary lymph node. Pleural effusion with associated collapsed left lung. Small pericardial effusion. Splenomegaly.

CXR after drainage of pleural effusion: little improvement in pleural effusion.

The patient presented with worsening dry cough X 1 month with associated pallor and dyspnea. He had also had an unintentional weight loss of 15kg and had been sleeping with his shirt off due to night sweats. One day prior to presentation, the patient"s father noted enlarged supraclavicular lymph nodes.
With the history of rapidly-growing lymph nodes and weight loss, our patient was suspicious for malignancy as the cause of the opacity on the initial chest XR. Differential included mass, pleural effusion or hemothorax. Further evaluation of the pleural effusion was done by chest CT with contrast. This was chosen because CT allows for differentiation of various soft tissues and liquid densities. The entire area of the left hemithorax was obscured on plain film and therefore CT allowed the radiologist to differentiate the mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion and pericardial effusion that were found.

There was some suspicion for a bloody pleural effusion from lung infiltration of the patient‚Äôs disease, which was suspected to be Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma due to the patient‚Äôs age and the massive mediastinal lymphadenopathy. However, bloody effusion from direct lung involvement is more likely in Non-Hodgkin"s lymphoma (Light). Indeed, the cytology did not reveal a bloody effusion. Eventually the patient was diagnosed with Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma on cervical lymph node biopsy.

Although patients with Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma often present with a mediastinal mass, a pleural effusion is not typical. One review showed that in studies of malignant pleural effusions in adults, up to 15% have been associated with lymphomas (Das). In children, lymphoma has been proven to be the most common cause of malignant pleural effusions in multiple studies (Das, Cleveland). However, pleural effusion is more common in Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma and is rarely present in Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma at diagnosis (Sahn). When large pleural effusions occur with lymphoma, such as our patient‚Äôs effusion, are also more common in Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma (Cleveland). Malignant pleural effusions of any etiology have been found to be more common in patients over 40 years (Das).

Pleural effusions that do occur in Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma are typically caused by obstruction of lymphatic vessels from mediastinal lymph node involvement (Light), and are more likely to happen later in the disease course rather than at presentation (Cleveland). One review found that there is a 30% chance of pleural effusion with progression of the disease and 30-60% incidence of pleural effusion at autopsy (Sahn). A study of autopsies performed on 141 patients with Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma ages 15-78 found a 60% incidence of pleural effusions, of which 74% were bilateral (Wong). 

Furthermore, a recent review reveals that most recent studies on malignant effusions associated with lymphoma have focused on Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma (Das). One study found that the presence or absence of a pleural effusion was not predictive for a diagnosis of Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma for primary mediastinal lymphoma (Tateishi).  However, one French study did reveal 23.5% of Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma cases had a pleural effusion on presentation; methodology and demographic information were not available for this study to evaluate its relevance (Essadki). A PubMed search using various combinations of the terms ‚ÄúHodgkin‚Äôs‚Äù or ‚ÄúHodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma‚Äù and ‚Äúpleural effusion‚Äù did not reveal any similar studies. 

Pericardial effusions, also noted in our patient, have been found to be most commonly caused by lymphomas if malignant, but are uncommon in both Hodgkin‚Äôs and Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma overall (Das). One study revealed pericardial effusions in only 4% of Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma patients (Essadki). Splenomegaly is a known, but relatively uncommon finding in Hodgkin"s lymphoma (McClain).

The combination of a large pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and splenomegaly make this an unusual presentation of Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma. The lack of blood in the pleural effusion, however, was a typical feature of Hodgkin‚Äôs pleural effusions.
