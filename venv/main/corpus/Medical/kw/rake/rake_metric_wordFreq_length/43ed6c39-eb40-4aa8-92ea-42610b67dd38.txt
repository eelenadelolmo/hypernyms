Positive lateral joint line tenderness. Positive swelling of left knee.

20 year old male, varsity basketball player, with 1 day history of left knee pain after sustaining varus stress to his left knee.
Operative treatment for the patient's anterior horn tear was challenging secondary to the location of the tear and the technical aspects of arthroscopy. Operative treatment in this case was performed because the patient is a high level athlete without medical problems and with good prognosis for complete recovery.
