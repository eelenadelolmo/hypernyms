N/A
Patient is pending orthopedic evaluation.
Sagittal T1WI and T2WI Fat Sat images demonstrate a double PCL sign.  Coronal T1WI demonstrates displacement of the medial meniscal fragment in the intercondylar notch.

Two selected Sagittal T1 images demonstrate an area of decreased signal intensity in Hoffa's fat pad which raises the question of arthrofibrosis.
Bucket Handle Meniscal Tear of the Knee
-Oblique meniscomeniscoligament
-Torn displaced ACL fragment
24 year old female with history of ACL reconstruction with clinical findings of medial joint line tenderness.
The findings in this case are classic for a bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus. The sagittal images demonstrated less than 2 bow tie segments on the sagittal view (on the original scan) and a double PCL sign.  The coronal view demonstrated the free fragment in the intercondylar notch.  

The patient's MR which was not included here included an intact neo-graft (ACL reconstruction).  There was also an area of decreased signal intensity in Hoffa's fat pad which raises the question of arthrofibrosis.
