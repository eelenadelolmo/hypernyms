Texto: 
Distended but not hard abdomen, bowel sounds diminished but occasional high pitched rushes present in all quadrants, mild periumbilical tenderness, no masses, no hepatosplenomegaly, no rebound, no guarding.  No fever, no cough.
Lysis of adhesions.
Films I, II -multiple dilated small bowel loops with differential air-fluid levels consistent with obstruction; note also multiple vertebral and rib anomalies
Films III, IV - multiple dilated small and large bowel loops with enteric contrast through to rectum, consistent with post-operative adynamic ileus
Small bowel obstruction from adhesions

2 y/o girl with H/O VACTERL association.  Presented to ER with 18 hour H/O bilious vomiting, vomiting all oral intake, and mild periumbilical pain. 

Surgical history: gastrostomy for feeding tube at 1 day old, T-E fistula repair at 5 days old, and modified Blalock-Taussig shunt at 4 mos.
The H/O VACTERL association is not directly relevant to this case except to explain several of the radiographic abnormalities and to bring up the question of previous surgery in this patient. VACTERL is an acronym for several congenital anomalies which have a greater than random chance to occur together. This is important since finding one or two of the obvious abnormalities should initiate a careful evaluation for any others which may have been initially overlooked. The components of the VACTERL association are: Vertebral and rib abnormalities, Anorectal malformation, Cardiac anomalies, Tracheo-esophogeal fistula, Esophogeal atresia, Renal anomalies and Limb (especially radial) abnormalities. 

The chief complaint in this patient is vomiting of all oral intake for 18 hours. With no signs or symptoms of acute gastroenteritis and no diarrhea, then bowel obstruction becomes an important consideration. This beocmes more likely since the patient has a history of abdominal surgery. On examining the first two films, there is distension of the small bowel. In adults it is abnormal to find air in the small bowel. This can be normal in infants but would be less common in our patient who is almost 3 years old. There is no air in the colon or rectum, which typically should contain some air. On the upright film there are multiple stair-stepped air/fluid levels in the small bowel. Radiographically this is the classic presentation of small bowel obstruction. 

The patient was taken to laparotomy where multiple small bowel adhesions where lysed.
