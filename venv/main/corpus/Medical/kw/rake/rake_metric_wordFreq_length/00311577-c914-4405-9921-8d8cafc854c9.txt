(+)Hematuria
Cystic, ecstatic tubular dilatation of the collecting ducts becomes apparent during urography as striated and saccular collections of contrast material, “paint brush” appearance.
Medullary Sponge Kidney
Papillary Blush
Papillary Necrosis
25 year old male with history of recurrent kidney stones.
This case demonstrates the classic description of the "paint brush" appearance on excretory urography.
It could not be papillary necrosis or papillary blush for the following reasons.

Papillary Blush results from the normal concentration of iodine in non-dilated collecting ducts.  Unlike Medullary Sponge Kidney, the papillary blush is homogeneous and each individual tubule is not distinguished.  The opacification of the papilla fades into the cortex.

Papillary necrosis refers to destruction of the apex of the pyramid, with resultant areas of cavitation and sinus formation between the papilla and calyx.  Unlike Medullary Sponger Kidney, papillary necrosis is not usually associated with medullary nephrocalcinosis.  Papillary necrosis is usually characterized by 1 or 2 irregular cavities that readily fill at retrograde pyelography; those in medullary sponge Kidney usually do not.
