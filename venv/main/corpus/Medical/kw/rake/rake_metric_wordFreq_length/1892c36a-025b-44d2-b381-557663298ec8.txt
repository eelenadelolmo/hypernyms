Bilateral coarse breath sounds and crackles.
Ongoing.
Selected axial CT images of the head show severe intracranial posttraumatic changes to include left frontoparietal contusion and hemorrhage with edema and resulting extracranial herniation of brain.

Portable AP view of the chest shows, in addition to various tubes and lines, increased pulmonary vascular and interstitial markings with a predominantly central distribution as well as patchy alveolar opacities consistent with pulmonary edema.  In a patient with normal underlying cardiopulmonary reserve, no history of recent fluid resuscitation, and severe head trauma, this patientâ€™s pulmonary edema was felt to most likely be neurogenic in nature.
Neurogenic pulmonary edema
Cardiogenic pulmonary edema
Noncardiaogenic pulmonary edema
