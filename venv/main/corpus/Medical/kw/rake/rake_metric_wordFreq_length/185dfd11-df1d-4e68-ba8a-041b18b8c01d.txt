Early treatment is preferred to improve long term results and avoid complications such as avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Devices such as the Pavlik harness are used in younger patients with variable success. Alternative treatments if the harness fails included closed reduction under anesthesia and placement in a hip spica cast. Open reduction is reserved for those failing less invasive procedures.  Redirectional osteotomies are reserved for older children to prevent or delay degeneration of the hip joint.
Bilateral shallow acetabula with lateral dysplacement of the femoral heads.  There is also valgus deformity of the femoral necks.
Developmental hip dysplasia in a child with cerebral palsy
None.
3 year old female with history of bilateral hip dysplasia
This child demontrates bilateral hip dysplasia with shallow acetabula  The acetabular index angle is greater than 30 degrees and the femoral head ossification center is seen lateral to Perkin's line.
