Plain film of the abdomen demonstrate a non-aggressive mixed sclerotic and lytic lesion affecting the right ilium.

Oblique reconstructed CT images from thin-section axial CT images demonstrate coarsened trabeculae in a radial pattern within the right ilium extending from the body to the crest, approximating vascular channels.  

This image demonstrates fat content within the lytic portion, further supporting the diagnosis for hemangioma.
hemangioma, bone
