The gallbladder demonstrates a nonshadowing, nonmobile hypoechoic mass along the superolateral wall of the gallbladder, as well as a nonshadowing hyperechoic area along the lateral wall.  Decubitus images were performed which identified the hypoechoic superolateral mass as nonmobile, and the hyperechoic area as mobile.
gallbladder mass
gallbladder polyp
adenomyomatosis 
gallbladder cancer 
tumefactive sludge 
metastases 
chronic cholecystitis
59 yo woman with 6 month history of ascites.
While the mobile nonshadowing hyperechoic area on the lateral wall is consistent with sludge, the nonmobile nonshadowing hypoechoic mass adjacent to the superolateral wall could represent a polyp, cancer, or tumefactive sludge.  The mass lacks many of the characteristic features of gallbladder cancer (eccentric irregular wall thickening, infiltration of liver or vessels, bile duct obstruction, or associated lymphadenopathy) the size (>10 mm) makes this lesion worrisome for cancer.  The patient was scheduled for a CT scan to further evaluate the finding, with possible resection to follow pending the results of the CT scan.
