N/A
Patient was referred to gynecology by primary care clinician.
Sonographic images demonstrates a focal hypoechoic area in the junctional zone posteriorly and at the level of the fundus.  Also present were well circumscribed intramural hypoechoic areas compatible with fibroids (not shown).

MR:
Axial and Sagittal T2 weighted sequences of the pelvis demonstrate a focal area of thickening of the junctional zone posteriorly compatible with focal adenomyosis.
Adenomyosis
Adenomyosis
Leiomyoma
35 year old with heavy menses and clotting.
Adenomyosis consists of endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium with associated myometrial hypertrophy.  Clinically, patients present with excessive uterine bleeding with worsening dysmenorrhea.  These symptoms are nonspecific and are also a sequelae of leiomyoma, endometriosis and endometrial polyps.  Adenomyosis occurs in premenopausal women.  Adenomyosis may be diffuse or focal. 

Sonographic findings include uterine enlargement not explained by the presence of leiomyomas, asymmetric thickening of the myometrial wall, poorly circumscribed areas in the myometrium, cysts of varying sizes and increased echogenicity of the myometrium.  However, features are subjective.

Adenomyosis on T1 weighted sequences may not be apparent.  T2 weighted images exhibit low signal intensity in the junctional zone which exceeds a short axis measurement of 11mm in adenomyosis.  Small foci of increased T1 and T2 signal may represent associated hemorrhage in these lesions.

This patient demonstrated a focal area of decreased echogenicity confirmed on MR cmpatible with focal adenomyosis.
