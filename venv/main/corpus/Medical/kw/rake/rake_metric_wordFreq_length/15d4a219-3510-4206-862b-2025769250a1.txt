AP radiograph of the pelvis demonstrates bilateral, symmetric poorly defined erosive abnormalities with adjacent sclerosis (particularly in the ilium), with associated joint space narrowing, and intra-articular osseous fusion.

Examination of the hip joints demonstrates bilateral, symmetric, and concentric joint space narrowing producing axial migration of the femoral heads with respect to the acetabulum.  Also note the osteophytes creating a collar around the femoral neck.

23 y.o caucasian male with long standing history of low back pain.  Presents with complaints of decrease ROM of bilateral hips.
The sacroiliac joint abnormalities in ankylosing spondylitis must be differentiated from those accompanying other disorders.  This can be accomplished by analysis of both distribution and morphology of the articular changes.  

Classically, a bilateral and symmetric distribution is observed in ankylosing spondylitis.  Although a similar pattern can be evident in other seronegative spondyloarthropathies, such as psoriasis and Reiter’s syndrome, asymmetric, unilateral alterations may accompany these disorders.  A bilateral and symmetric distribution also is associated with the sacroiliitis of inflammatory bowel disease.  In rheumatoid arthritis, minor sacroiliac joint abnormalities commonly are bilateral but maybe asymmetric.  Bilateral and symmetric alterations of the sacroiliac joints also are noted in hyperparathyroidism, osteitis condensans ilii, gouty arthritis, and DJD, although in the last 2 conditions, an asymmetric or unilateral distribution is not uncommon.  Unilateral abnormalities are most typical in infection.

Poorly defined erosive abnormality with adjacent sclerosis, particularly in the ilium, with associated joint space narrowing, intra-articular osseous fusion, and ligamentous ossification is the characteristic appearance of sacroiliac disease in classic ankylosing spondylitis and in the sacroiliitis of IBD.  In psoriasis and Reiter’s syndrome, extensive bony eburnation is usually unaccompanied by intra-articular osseous fusion.  Sacroiliac joint involvement in rheumatoid arthritis usually is manifested as superficial erosions, minimal sclerosis, and absence of significant bony ankylosis.  Subchondral resorption of bone, predominantly in the ilium, in hyperparathyroidism leads to irregularity of the osseous surface, adjacent sclerosis, and widening of the intraosseous joint space.  In osteitis condensans ilii, a triangular segment of bone sclerosis is evident in the inferior aspect of the ilium and the joint surface is well defined.  In chronic tophaceous gouty arthritis, large, gouged-out defects with surrounding sclerosis is observed, whereas in degenerative arthritis, joint space narrowing, bony sclerosis, and anterior osteophytes dominate the picture.
