Physical exam demonstrated a right foot mass, tender to palpation located at the lateral dorsal aspect of the foot. Other exam and laboratory data was noncontributory.
The patient went to surgery and underwent synovectomy with good results. Follow up since surgery was not yet documented in our system.
Plain films were obtained at an outside facility and unable to be reviewed. MRI was performed and demonstrated an extra articular mass on the dorsal aspect of the foot with low signal on T1 and T2 with variable contrast enhancement. A gradient echo sequence demonstrated low signal as well as blooming artifact.

Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis, Synovitis, Siderotic synovitis, capsulitis, and scarring.
Patient is a 12 year old girl who presented with pain and tenderness over her right foot. She noticed growth of a tender mass near the ankle joint.
