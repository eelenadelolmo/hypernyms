Abnormal pulsoxiemtry
Anxious - required medical anxiolysis for VQ scan
D-dimer 2.58
Initially the clinicians in the ER reported a high level of concern regarding PE which required the weekend performance of a VQ scan for this patient with CRI.  In this case, the clinicians were not satisfied and proceeded to BLE US evaluation for DVT.  When that resulted as negative, no thrombolytic therapy was initiated.
Chest X-ray
•no acute cardiopulmonary disease
•multiple healed old right rib fractures
VQ Scan
•moderate unmatched segment within the inferior segment of the lingula - intermediate probablity scan
•relative defect of radiotracer signal from the mid anterior basal or lateral basal segments, however this defect does not extend to the parenchymal edge and is most likely artifactual
Positive VQ Scan - Clinician decided against Pulmonary Embolism
•Pulmonary Embolism
•Acute Myocardial Infarction
•Reversible Myocardial Ischemia
59 yo AAM with multiple recent hospitalizations, SOB, DOE
Scintigraphic images, when taken alone, reflect an intermediate probability
for disease state. Therefore between 20 and 80% incidence of pulmonary thromboembolism is present according to the amended Pioped Criteria of 1995.   We always include the following for VQ scans performed at WRAMC: Please note that the requesting clinician should interpret this data in light of his/her pretest likelihood ratio for disease state.
