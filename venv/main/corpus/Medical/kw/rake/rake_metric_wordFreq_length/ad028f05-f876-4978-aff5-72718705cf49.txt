CXR shows left-sided pleural effusion.  CT confirms left sided pleural effusion and also shows &#8220;bubbly&#8221; pneumomediastinum. UGI shows small perforation on left side of distal esophagus near the GE junction. There is spasm of the esophagus probably as a result of the perforation. There is also a large amount of aspirated contrast material.

Esophageal perforation from ingested foreign object, infection, neoplasm, or instrumentation.
85 year old woman reported vomiting several times after eating, probably secondary to food poisoning. While retching she experienced sudden severe pain in her mid chest and began to vomit blood.
