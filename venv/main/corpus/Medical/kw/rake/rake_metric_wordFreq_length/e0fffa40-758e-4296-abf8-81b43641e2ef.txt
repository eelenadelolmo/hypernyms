Texto: 
Egophony was heard on the right lower/mid lung field. Labs within normal limits, no leukocytosis.
Patient was treated with 21 day course of oral clindamycin with resolution of infection but with remaining cystic lesions on chest CT. Based on patient history of recurrent lung infections and radiographic findings, patient was suspected of having an intralobar pulmonary sequestration. Thoracic surgery resected the affected lung segment, confirming the diagnosis.
1st Image: PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate patchy air space density involving the right lower lobe. There is a cavitary lesion with an air-fluid level worrisome for abscess formation.  The remainder of the lung parenchyma is clear and evenly aerated without additional regions of consolidation identified.   There is focal extroconvex curvature involving the thoracic spine, unchanged.  

Next 3 images: Within the right lung base there is a large area of consolidation with accompanying bronchiectasis as well as a cavitary lesion with an air fluid level.  Several additional areas of patchy opacity are present likely representing accompanying atelectasis.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  No enlarged lymph nodes are identified.

Last image: There is a cluster of well-defined thin-walled cysts in the right lung base, some of which are confluent.  The previously noted marked soft tissue thickening around them has resolved during the study interval as has the air-fluid level.  No soft tissue thickening persists in this region.  The lungs are otherwise clear.

22-year-old woman with history of recurrent pulmonary infections presents with cough for 2.5 weeks, fever, intermittent sputum production, but no hemoptysis
This patient's history is typical for patients with intralobar pulmonary sequestration. She has had recurrent  RLL pneumonia - one episode was 4 years ago while in boot camp; and, a second documented RLL pneumonia one year ago as well. She also describes a long history of periodic episodes of severe fatigue and subjective fevers that were most likely undiagnosed pulmonary infections.
