Patient has had biopsies to test for Hirschprungs and Celiac Disease - both of which were negative. She received treatment to clean out her bowel.
Plain Film: Mottled gas Pattern in the LUQ (large intestine).

CT: Markedly abnormal study demonstrating stool-distended bowel extending from the distal transverse colon to the level of the rectum, with associated compression of several structures, most noticeably the distal right ureter with associated mild dilatation of the collecting system.  There is also shift of the adnexal structures and uterus to the left. The largest dilatation of the bowel appears to be at the level of the sigmoid colon which measures approximately 11.6cm in short axis diameter.
Idiopathic Constipation/Retained Stool
DDX for Mottled Gas Pattern on Plain film:
*Stool
*Abscess
*Sponge
*Bezoar

DDX for Constipation:
*Poor Diet
*Poor Bowel Habits
*Hirschsprung's Disease
*Medications: Iron, antacids, narcotic pain meds...
*Laxative abuse
*Anal Fissures
33 year old woman with constipation since childhood. She presented with abdominal distension and pain.
