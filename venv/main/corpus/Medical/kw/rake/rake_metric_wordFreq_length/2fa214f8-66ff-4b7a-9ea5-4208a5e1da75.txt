Pertinent PE:
EMG findings demonstrate an active C7 radiculopathy. 
Musculoskeletal: decreased range of motion of the neck in all four directions.
	Decreased range of motion of the right arm.  Unable to raise right arm past 90 degrees laterally and anteriorly without pain
	Full range of motion in other extremities.
Neurological:
	Sensory: Diminished light touch sensation ws noted over the hands and forearms bilaterally with monofilament testing.  Diminished sensation in the feet was noted bilaterally.  
                       Straight leg test positive for both legs.  
	Motor:+4 strength of upper right arm in flexion and abduction, +4 strength in the hip flexor bilaterally, 4+ leg extension and flexion of right side.
	Rest of exam is +5.  
	CN: III,IV, VI- intact
	       V- intact
	       VII- intact
	       VIII- decreased hearing on the left by finger rubbing test
               IX/X- intact
               XI- intact
	       XII- intact
The patient continues to receive chiropractic care to the upper cervical segments with symptomatic relief of his cephalgia.  The patient has been prescribed cyclobenzaprine to take before bed to help with neck pain and sleep.  He is to receive a C2 nerve block in 3 weeks for the pain.
â€¢ MRI Image findings:Straightening of the normal cervical lordosis is noted in neutral position.  No instability is demonstrated on sagittal flexion and extension imaging.  Decreased disc height is noted at the C5-6 and C6-7 levels.  Prominent modic type II endplate degenerative changes are present at the C5-6 level.  There is no evidence for focal marrow replacement or marrow edema of the lumbar vertebrae.  An hemangioma is noted at the T1 vertebral body.  The craniocervical junction is unremarkable.  There is no evidence for focal abnormal signal or focal expansion of the cervical spinal cord.  Mild degenerative spurring is noted at the anterior atlanto-axial articulation.  

At the C2-3 level there is a central/right paracentral disc herniation of the protrusion type measuring approximately 3 mm in AP dimension which effaces the right anterior subarachnoid space.  No significant foraminal stenosis is evident.  

At the C3-4 level there is no evidence for central canal or foraminal stenosis.  No significant intervertebral disc pathology is evident.

At the C4-5 level there is a right paracentral disc herniation of the protrusion type with posterior spurring measuring approximately 3 mm in AP dimension which effaces the right anterior subarachnoid space.  A mild degree of right sided foraminal stenosis is noted secondary to asymmetric posterior spurring, uncovertebral and facet joint degenerative changes.  

At the C5-6 level there is a broad based central disc herniation of the protrusion type with posterior spurring measuring approximately 2 mm in AP dimension which asymmetry to the left which impinges upon the anterior/left anterior subarachnoid space at this level.  A mild degree of right sided and moderate to severe degree of left sided foraminal stenosis is noted secondary to asymmetric posterior spurring, uncovertebral and facet joint degenerative changes.

At the C6-7 level there is a broad based central disc herniation of the protrusion type with posterior spurring measuring approximately 3 mm in AP dimension with asymmetry to the right which partially effaces the anterior/right anterior subarachnoid space.  A moderate degree of left sided and severe degree of right sided foraminal stenosis is noted secondary to asymmetric posterior spurring, uncovertebral and facet joint degenerative changes.

At the C7-T1 level there is no evidence for central canal or foraminal stenosis.  No significant intervertebral disc pathology is evident.  

No significant accentuation of intervertebral disc pathology is noted upon sagittal flexion and extension imaging.
Post-traumatic Headache more likely the result of cerviogenic origin from resultant disc herniation affect than from a post-concussive syndrome.
Post-Concussive Syndrome
Cervicogenic headache
Migraine
Cervical disc herniation
Lumbar disc herniation
Patient is a 43 y.o. male s/p head injury in June 2012.  He was seen at an outside hospital after he was struck on the superior part of his head by a piece of angle iron weighing 40 lbs falling a distance of 7 feet.  At the hospital he was evaluated by CT scanning of the head and was discharged with no evidence of hematomas.  he then presented for Chiropractic care.  Since his injury, he has developed headache, back pain, leg pain, and shoulder pain.  His headache is a constant pain that originates on the posterior head/neck and migrates into the left side of the head.  The pain is relieved by lying down in a dark room.  There is associated nausea and vomiting.  He has low back pain that is always present.  He has pain in his back while walking, sitting and most other activities of daily living.  The pain radiates down his right leg.  He has trouble lying with his legs straight.  His shoulder pain is on the right side near the clavicle and deltoid.  It is an intermittent pain that can be elicited with movement, most prominently with arm flexion. 

His past medical history is unremarkable other than injury mentioned.  He is not on any medications, has no allergies, and is a smoker.
Pertinent Review of Systems:
HEENT: headache, intermittent blurry vision of right eye, rhinorrhea
GI: nausea and vomiting 
Musculoskeletal: Back pain, leg pain, shoulder pain
Neurologic: Memory loss
Psych: Depressed
