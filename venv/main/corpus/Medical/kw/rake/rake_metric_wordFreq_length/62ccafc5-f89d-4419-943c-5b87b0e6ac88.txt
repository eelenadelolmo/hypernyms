Mutliple well-defined lytic lesions that coalesce and in an overall geographic appearance. 
Location is predominatly posterior half of calvarium. 
"Beveled-edge" appearance can be seen radiographically.
CT show greater destruction of the inner table compared to the outer.
Eosinophilic granuloma of the calvarium
Metastatic disease
Osteomyelitis
Lymphoma
Ewing's sarcoma
Eosiniphilic granuloma
Skull pain
Note the atypical greater destruction of inner table relative to outer table, yet still resulting in the classic "beveled edge" appearance
