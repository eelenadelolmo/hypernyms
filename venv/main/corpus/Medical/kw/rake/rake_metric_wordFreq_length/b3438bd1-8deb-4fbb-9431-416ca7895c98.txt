Patient’s symptoms were relieved with therapeutic injection of the talonavicular joint.
Axial CT with sagittal reformats through the ankle reveals cortical disruption at the proximal articular surface of the tarsal navicular bone. Multiloculated subchondral cyst adjacent to the cortical defect is noted.
Osteochondritis Dissecans of the Tarsal Navicular
Stress fracture (Expect to see partial or complete sagittal fracture line through navicular)
Osteonecrosis (Usually see sclerosis and/or collapse of the navicular)
40 year old female with chronic right dorsal mid foot pain. Patient’s symptoms were relieved with therapeutic injection of the talonavicular joint.
Osteochondritis dissecans is the traditional term used to describe osteochondral fracture. The osteochondral fragment may remain in situ or partially or completely detached from its origin, forming a loose body. Osteochondritis dissecans has been described in a variety of bones. The ankle accounts for 4% of all cases of OCD and the tarsal navicular bone is rarely involved. Most commonly, ankle OCD’s are seen in the talar dome. 

Radiographically, osteochondritis dissecans is often seen best on a lateral view as a lucent lesion disrupting the articular rim of the involved bone. CT demonstrates the navicular lesions well in both sagittal and coronal reformats, frequently as cortical depressions with a rim of sclerosis. MRI shows osteochondral lesions with low signal intensity on T1 and high signal intensity on T2 sequences (secondary to adjacent edema). Nuclear medicine bone scan typically shows mild to marked focal uptake in the region of the osteochondral defect. 

The pathogenesis of the process is unknown but believed to be related to repetitive trauma, particularly from forces transmitted through the metatarsal rays on plantar flexion of the foot. Treatment is conservative with non-weight bearing activity and analgesia. Only patients with completely detached osteochondral fragments need consider undergo surgery to remove a symptomatic loose body.
