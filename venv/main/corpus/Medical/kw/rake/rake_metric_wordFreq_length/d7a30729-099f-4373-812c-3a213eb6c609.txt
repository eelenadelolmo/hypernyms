Texto: 
Asymmetric proliferative erosions of the DIP joints with ill-defined margins, periosteal reaction and soft tissue swelling.
Psoriatic Arthritis
Reiter's Disease
Erosive OA
The presence of central erosions in the third and fourth digits of the left makes this case more difficult as it can be confused with erosive osteoarthritis. The erosive changes accompanied by illdefined bone formation at IP joint of the left thumb helps establish the correct diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis.
