Texto: 
Gluteal deformity noted on newborn exam with asymmetry and deviation of gluteal cleft towards the right.  On neurologic exam decreased tone is noted.  No suck, root, grasp or gallant reflexes are elicited.
At the time of creation of this case file, this patient has had no treatment.
The exam of the brain, cranium, craniocervical junction, and upper cervical spinal cord are unremarkable (not shown).  

There is normal alignment of the vertebral bodies and facets throughout the spine.  Bone marrow is homogeneous in signal intensity.  There is a tethered cord, terminating as a lipomyelocele.  The neural placode-lipoma interface is located within the spinal canal at approximately S3. There is associated posterior spinal dysraphism. No meningocele is identified. There is no syrinx.  Lipoma is noted in the subcutaneous region extending into the spinal canal more marked on the left side. The overlying skin is intact.
Lipomyelocele
Lipomyelomeningocele, myelomeningocele, meningocele, terminal myelocystocele, Chiari malformation, filar lipoma, tight filum terminale
The patient is a 1 month old female, born at 40wks EGA to a mother with gestational diabetes mellitus.
Exam of the brain, upper cervical spinal cord and cranium is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of Arnold-Chiari malformation or syrinx.
Cervical and thoracic spine are unremarkable with homogenous spinal cord signal intensity and bony structures which are normal in appearance and alignment.
There is a tethered cord, terminating as a lipomyelocele with the neural placode-lipoma interface located within the spinal canal at S3.  No meningocele is identified.  There is associated posterior spinal dysraphism/spina bifida.  There is a lipoma in the subcutaneous region extending into the spinal canal, with a left-sided predominance.  The overlying skin is intact. Deviation of the gluteal cleft is noted towards the right side.  There is no syrinx. Bladder is distended and constipation is noted.  A redundant stool filled sigmoid colon is noted.
