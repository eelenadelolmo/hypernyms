Osteoporosis, patchy osteonecrosis, subchondral radiolucent lines (crescent sign), osseous collapse, and fragmentation are recognized.

-	Pancreatitis, pregnancy
-	Lupus erythematosus
-	Alcoholism, atherosclerosis
-	Steroids
-	Trauma 
-	Idiopathic, Infection
-	Caisson disease, collagen diseases, cancer
-	Rheumatoid arthritis, radiation tx
-	Amyloid
-	Gaucher disease
-	Sickle cell dz

(Mnemonic - P L A S T I C   R A G S)
43 yo male with a h/o Crohnâ€™s disease and long term steroid use.
This is a good case of steroid induced bilateral humeral head osteonecrosis.  This particular patient had a history of Crohnâ€™s disease and long term steroid use for the past several years, placing him at a significantly higher risk for AVN.  

With the multifocal involvement, steroid induced AVN becomes the leading diagnosis (95%).  Furthermore, he has no history of any other diseases, trauma, or significant life-style practices that place him at risk for osteonecrosis, making the steroids the likely culprit.

Radiographic and pathologic characteristics of osteonecrosis due to corticosteroids are not unique, being also evident in cases of bony necrosis from other causes.  Osteoporosis, patchy osteonecrosis, subchondral radiolucent lines (crescent sign), osseous collapse, and fragmentation are recognized.  Preservation of joint space is also typical during the early stages of the process.
