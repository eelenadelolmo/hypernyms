Texto: 
Diffusely tender abdomen with voluntary guarding. All labs were normal. Pt was tachycardic but afebrile.
Pt was treated conservatively with NG tue, NPO and Morphine. Bowel obstruction was relieved approximately 10 hours later and plain films returned to normal. Pt's symptoms subsided.
Dilated loops of small bowel containing fluid with wall thickening and an apparent transition point in the distal ileum after an are of twisted bowel. There is free fluid surrounding the small bowel and in Morrison's Pouch. A gall stone is seen in the gallbladder and diverticulosis is seen in the colon. An apendix is not visualized.
High grade Small bowel obstruction
High grade partial small bowel obstruction from adhesions, diverticulitis, appendicitis.

Volvulus

Complete Bowel obstruction

Gallstone ileus
52y/o female with colicky, poorly localized abdominal pain beginning approximately 12 hours prior to presentation. The patient had vomited numerous times and was not passing stool or flatus.
A similar scenario has occured to this patient on 2 other occasions. No other CT studies are available for review, so it is unclear if the same anatomic point is the nidus for the obstruction each time.
