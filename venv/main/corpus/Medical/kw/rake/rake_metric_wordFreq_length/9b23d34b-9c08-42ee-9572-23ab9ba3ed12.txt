There is a small avulsion fracture of the lateral tibial plateau.
Segond fracture
twisting of knee with persistent pain.
While these are generally taught as being secondary to avulsion by the lateral capsule of the knee, there are newer indications that this injury may also be caused by tibial band attachments of the fibular collateral ligament....the debate continues.
