Plain film: The supine plain film of this infant at first glance demonstrates an apparent gastric outlet obstuction with a small amount of air within the proximal duodenum. The degree of gastric distention is variable, depending on the amount and frequency of vomiting. (Proximal gastric and duodenal dilatation can even be absent because of repeated emesis).	There is a
generalized paucity of gas distal to the apparent
obstruction. The lack of distal bowel gas suggests that the mechanical obstruction is complete. Distention of
gas-filled distal bowel is not seen, and there is no evidence of pneumatosis or pneumoperitoneum. These findings are relatively nonspecific, because in this supine film the duodenum is probably filled with fluid, thus making it invisible radiographically. The air in the distended stomach could erroneously suggest a gastric outlet obstruction. The "double-bubble" sign of duodenal atresia can also occur in malrotation but is not seen here.

Upper GI Series: The first finding to note is the abnormal position of the nasogastric tube passing downward into an abnormally positioned jejunum. Before presenting the rest of the findings, it is important to know the normal anatomical features. The normal duodenojejunal junction, or Ligament of Treitz, is at the same level as the duodenal bulb - anterior to the left transverse process of L-1. The proximal jejunum is
normally in the left abdomen.
Note the persistent dilatation of the duodenal bulb and proximal duodenum, terminating in a distinctive conical shape. (The cone is hidden because of the overlying duodenal dilatation). There appears to be an obstruction of the third portion of the duodenum. In addition to this, the duodenum lies somewhat further
to the right of the spine than normal (i.e.	poor fixation
secondary to the absence of the Ligament of Treitz).	The
mechanical obstruction is incomplete as evidenced by the passage of barium contrast beyond the point of obstruction into the jejunum. As the jejunum fills, it is seen to lie in an abnormal mid-abdominal and right-sided position. In this study, the "corkscrew" pattern of the small bowel (which is pathonogmonic of acute midgut volvulus) is absent. However, one can see the thickened folds of the valvulae conniventes. This is due to vascular obstruction and lymphatic engorgement. This is consistent with pathognomic spiraling of the small bowel around the superior mesenteric artery (i.e. vascular compromise can be assumed with certainty). Because of the mucosal edema, the corkscrew bowel segment may be difficult to see, especially at the most distal point of this contrast study. Finally, there is an oblique line formed by the narrowing of the contrast column. This is consistent with tight Ladd's bands.

functional obstruction secondary to Hirschsprung's    disease or meconium ileus/plug.
Nine day-old infant male who presents with bilious vomiting.
This was immediately operated on and found to have an acute midgut volvulus with vascular compromise.
The differential diagnosis for vomiting in neonates is extensive. Common etiologies include: gastroesophageal reflux, neonatal sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis (especially in premature infants), and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Some of the uncommon causes are: congenital atresias or stenoses (esophagus to anus), malrotation with midgut volvulus, and functional obstruction secondary to Hirschsprung's disease or meconium ileus/plug.
     As noted above, midgut volvulus occurs relatively infrequently. Nevertheless, the sudden onset of bilious vomiting in an otherwise healthy neonate should immediately be considered midgut volvulus until proven otherwise; it is an absolute surgical and radiologic emergency. The clinical symptoms are a manifestation of the complications of malrotation. The most common complications are mechanical obstruction (complete or partial) and vascular compromise due to volvulus with impending ischemic necrosis, perforation and shock.
In the radiographic evaluation of the child with bilious vomiting, the major question is whether a mechanical obstruction is present with a midgut volvulus. Plain films are useful and can demonstrate no abnormality, apparent gastric obstruction, duodenal obstruction, or apparent low small-bowel obstruction with multiple, distended loops of bowel. Next, an upper GI series is indicated to confirm the presence of midgut volvulus. This is the study of choice as opposed to using a barium enema, which is inadequate to make the diagnosis for two reasons. First, flouroscopic and spot film identification of abnormal cecal position is difficult in the neonate, as the colon is redundant and the cecum is normally high. Second, duodenal obstruction due to malrotation may occur in the presence of a normally positioned colon. The radiologic signs of malrotation on the UGI series include (1) abnormal position of the Ligament of Treitz; (2) spiral or corkscrew appearance of the duodenum; and (3) proximal jejunum in the right abdomen. It is an exceedingly rare case of malrotation that does not demonstrate at least one of these three signs.
