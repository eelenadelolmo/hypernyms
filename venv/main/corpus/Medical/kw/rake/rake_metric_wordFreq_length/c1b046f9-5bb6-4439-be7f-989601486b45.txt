•Axial CT image demonstrates bilateral extraaxial subdural  fluid collections which aremore prominent along the frontal convexities.  These have a slightly increased attenuation when compared with the CSF, and are consistent with chronic subdural hematomas.  In addition there is a linear density within the left subdural space and along the falx posteriorly consistent with an acute subdural hematoma.

•Multiple MR images confirm the presence of bilateral subdural hematomas of differing signal intensities consistent with acute on chronic subdurals
Child abuse/Non-accidental trauma
• Accidental Trauma
• Non-accidental trauma (Child Abuse)
4 month old baby girl brought to the ER after an acute life threatening event.
This case demonstrates the utility of MRI in evaluating the presence/extent of edema present in cases of non-accidental head trauma.  The presence of the subdural hemorrhages is evident on CT.  However, there was no evidence of edema (i.e. loss of gray-white differentiation, sulcal effacement, or reversal sign).  

Subsequent MRI revealed diffuse white matter restricted diffusion with corresponding increased T2 signal (out of proportion of the patient's stage of myelination) consistent with diffuse white matter cytotoxic edema.
