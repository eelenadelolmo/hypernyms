There was reported functional ROM of shoulders elbows wrists hips knees and ankles.

Strength
5/5 at Left upper extremities including intrinsic muscles of hands, grip strength firm bilaterally, however 4/5 strength was noted at Right deltoid, wrist extensors and flexors and intrinsic muscles of the hands
5/5 bilateral lower extremities including dorsiflexors, inverters, and everters of the feet.
SLR positive in supine/sitting position of right and left at 60°.
DTR 2+ at bilateral subpatellar and Achilles, 2+ in bilateral upper extremities.
Sensation- intact to light touch bilateral upper and lower extremities in all major dermatomes
Pathologic reflexes – Hoffman sign positive on right only.
Follow up included nerve conduction studies and electromyography studies at 2 months post injury which showed Right C5-6 cervical radiculopathy along with right L5 radiculopathy causally related to the injuries he sustained in the MVA.

He has continued to receive care from his chiropractor 2-3x per week and chronic pain management, along with conservative therapy for his shoulder for the rotator cuff injury. He also received facet joint blocks recently, but I was unable to see the patient since the time of the procedure.

The patient is a 52 y/o M s/p MVC. He was the restrained driver of his vehicle stopped at red light when two vehicles collided, and one of those vehicles then ricocheted into his passenger side front quarter panel. He reports going to a local hospital with neck and low back complaints. X-rays were taken at that time (images not available) d/c’d home with instructions to follow up with primary doctor.  

The patient then initiated chiropractic care 3x a week, pain management and was prescribed tramadol and Flexeril.  He denied any previous injury to the cervical and lumbar spine prior to the accident

On a scale of 0-10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is the most pain he has ever been in he reports that his neck pain is rated a 7/10 on average, 10/10 at its worst. He reports radiation of pain to right shoulder with associated numbness and paresthesias. 

He reports lower back pain rated  7/10. He reports that the pain is centralized to the middle of his lower back and does not tend to radiate. He does report numbness and paresthesias paraspinally.  He reports no  bladder or bowel incontinence

The patient has done reasonably well with conservative management: chiropractic care and pain management. He continues to have some pain and weakness that he feels is improving with his current care.

The patient’s history of a motor vehicle collision accompanied by radiating pain from the neck and  mild weakness on right upper extremity as well as pain, numbness and paresthesias of the right lower back raises suspicion for cervical and lumbar radiculopathy (Braddom & Spitz, 2009).  

Along with the right sided pain in his shoulders with some associated weakness, a rotator cuff injury or other shoulder pathology should be considered.  (Gerow, Matthew, Jahn, & Gerow, 1981)
 
His pain is most likely being produced from his injury. This is consistent with the EMG findings and his corresponding imaging. There is evidence of both foraminal stenosis and disc herniations in the cervical spine at the associated levels of radiculopathy as per MRI evaluation. 

In his lumbar spine, there is evidence of minimal diffuse bulge less than 2mm at the L3-4 level as per MRI.  This is smaller than the findings of a protrusion of 3mm which is considered clinically significant in the AP dimension which is most likely causing his pain as determined by the nerve conduction and EMG studies. 
He was seen by a spine specialist who recommended the patient continue his conservative therapy as long as he is receiving symptomatic relief with no worsening of symptoms or new onset of concerning symptoms.

Following up on his rotator cuff tear, he has elected to use conservative therapy, however if in 3-6 months his symptoms to not improve, it may be prudent to undergo operative repair.  (Gerow, Matthew, Jahn, & Gerow, 1981)

In this patient, he is noted to have both foraminal stenosis and disc herniations. However his disc herniations at the C5-6 and the C6/C7 levels are noted to be central. However, in the imaging, it was found that he had bilateral foraminal stenosis with greater narrowing on the right side which would be pre-existing to the MVA. In the described accident the impact to the vehicle that the patient was in was on the passenger side.  This impact would necessarily cause rapid right lateral bending of the cervical spine.  This trauma in the presence of IVF narrowing of the moderate to severe variety on the right side can cause neural impingement as a result of the accident.  Therefore, it is my opinion that the central disc herniations being small in nature are not the causative agent in this patient’s radiculopathy.  Rather it is the neuroforaminal narrowing that is rapidly compressed in the accident that can produce the neural injury and resultant radiculopathy noted on EMG evaluation.  Similarly the disc herniation/protrusion in the lower lumbar region is small and central in location favoring neuroforaminal encroachment associated with trauma as the causative agent producing radiulopathy.
