Serum Gastrin >1000
Abnormally increased uptake is present anterior to the right kidney in the region of the head of the pancreas, consistent with gastrinoma.
Symptomatic gastrinoma, diagnosed by labaratory and OctreoScan.
Metastatic neuroendocrine tumor.  Gastrinoma is the likely etiology, given symptomatology, abnormally elevated gastrin levels, and the location of the primary lesion.  Other neuroendocrine tumors that demonstrate abnormally increased uptake on OctreoScan include carcinoid, pheochromocytoma, neuroblastoma, paraganglioma, insulinoma, vipoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, etc.
Chronic nausea and vomitting with abnormally high serum gastrin levels.
