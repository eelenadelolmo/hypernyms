Physical exam and laboratory work up were normal.  Original ultrasound was performed for painless mass at superior pole of right testis which was found to be an epidydimal cyst.
Follow up and treatment of testicular microlithiaisis is somewhat controversial.  At this institution, patients are followed up with yearly screening ultrasounds, and advised to perform self-exams.
Testicular ultrasound demonstrates multiple, punctate, hyperechoic foci scattered diffusely throughout the testicular parenchyma.  These findngs are bilateral.  No other intratesticular abnormalities are noted.  Importantaly no solid masses were seen.
Testicular microlithiasis
Microlithiasis
23-year-old midshipman presents for one-year follow up for bilateral testicular microlithiasis.
Microlithiasis is not an uncommon incidental finding on testicular ultrasounds performed for other reasons, as in this case.  It is classified as classic if five or more microliths are seen on at least one view of the testis.  It is considered limited if there are fewer than this.  Microlithiasis has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of testicular malingnancy.  It is for this reason that in many institutions yearly screening ultrasounds are recommended.
