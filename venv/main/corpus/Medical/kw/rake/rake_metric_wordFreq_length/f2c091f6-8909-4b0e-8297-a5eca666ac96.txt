Normal appearing man, in no acute distress. 
Labs not available.
Patient underwent mechanical dilatation of stricture and was initiated on PO liquid corticosteroids with improvement in symptoms. No offending allergen was discovered.
Barium esophagram demonstrates persistent, thin, concentric rings within the proximal two-thirds of the thoracic esophagus with a corrugated or ringed appearance. This results in esophageal narrowing, and when the patient attempted to swallow a 12.5 mm barium tablet the tablet failed to pass beyond this narrowed esophageal segment.
