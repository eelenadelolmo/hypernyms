Abdominal Exam: Soft, obvious right sided mass, relatively non-tender.        Extremities:  All pulses 2+ palpable, equal
Patient underwent right radical nephrectomy and exploration of left kidney.  Uneventful hospital course.  Discharged to home on POD #6 following first course of chemotherapy by pediatric oncology service.
RUQ Ultrasound:  A large mass is seen in the right upper quadrant in the expected placement of the right kidney.   The mass appears heterogeneous with multiple cystic components.  The mass appears somewhat well marginated.  No hypervascularity is seen.  A wedge of renal parenchyma can be seen at the interface of the tumor and the liver on slide #2.
Abd. CT:   A 14cm, heterogenous renal mass extending from the right kidney with surrounding rim of renal parenchyma.  There are multiple low density collections within the mass.  There is no evidence of fat within the mass or calcifications (suggesting against renal angiomyolipoma or rhabdoid tumor of the kidney respectively).  Both kidneys demonstrate contrast enhancement and excretion.  No obvious tumor extensions into the renal vein or inferior vena cava is noted.  Mildly enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes adjacent to the kidney suggest possible malignant spread or may be reactive.
Wilmsâ€™ Tumor (nephroblastoma).  Negative left renal involvement.  Negative mesenteric lymph node pathology.

13 year old Caucasian female who presented to the ER following a two week history of right sided abdominal pain and one episode of hematuria (patient was not currently menstruating).  Patient denies fever, weight loss, nausea, vomiting.
Wilmsâ€™ tumor is a mixed embryonal neoplasm that is the most common intra-abdominal tumor and renal malignancy in childhood.  It is the fourth most common pediatric cancer1,2.  
The median age of sporadic Wilmsâ€™ is 44 months, although teenage patients (as in this case presentation) may present with it. The incidence of bilateral tumours is between 8â€“12% and the gender ratio is fairly even at 1:1.2.  The mass is usually smooth, fixed and firm, occasionally extending across the midline of the abdomen.  Though usually asymptomatic, 20-30% of patients experience hematuria, abdominal pain, hypertension, and fever.  Symptoms such as weight loss, cachexia, or bone pain are uncommon for Wilmsâ€™ tumor3.
Wilmsâ€™ tumor can spread locally through the tumor capsule or hematogenously to the lungs, liver, or the other kidney.  It may progress into the inferior vena cava as far as the right atrium3. 
Wilmsâ€™ tumor, which is intra-renal in development, must be distinguished from neuroblastoma.  Neuroblastoma typically arises in the adrenal glands and is the second most common childhood solid tumor.  Neuroblastomas also tend to have calcifications, another difference from Wilmsâ€™ tumors that may be discerned radiologically1, 4.
Patients with chromosomal aberrations on 11p13 and 11p15 have been shown to be at increased risk of Wilmsâ€™ tumor.  Such patients may present with other conditions that include aniridia, mental retardation, macroglossia, organomegaly, or genitourinary anomalies3.
The first line of diagnostic studies for Wilmsâ€™ tumor is ultra sound, providing a non-invasive means of evaluating tumor mass in the abdomen. It can be helpful in ruling out an extra-renal mass (neuroblastoma) or hydronephrosis5.  CT becomes especially useful in detection of bilateral tumors and in evaluation of other abdominal structures, peritoneum, and lymph nodes.  On CT Wilmsâ€™ tumor appears as a heterogenous, enhancing mass with less than 10% showing calcification.  A â€œclaw sign" of the displaced renal tissue may be seen2.  On MRI the tumors are hypointense with T1, variable with T2, and enhance poorly with gadolinium.  Gadolinium is given, however, to evaluate the other kidney for another Wilmsâ€™ mass2.
A chest xray is important when evaluating a patient preoperatively for lung metastasis.  Most centers, however, prefer the use of chest CT.  Though chest CT is a sensitive modality for Wilms tumor, it is susceptible to false positives for lung metastasis as well as inter-reader variability.  Histological assessment may show the presence of nephrogenic rests, primordial precursor lesions in the kidney, common in the setting of Wilmsâ€™ tumor6.
Nearly all patients undergo surgery as the primary treatment method.  Chemotherapeutic regimens of vincristine, doxorubicin, and dactinomycin with or without radiation therapy (depending on the stage of the tumor) are used in treating Wilmsâ€™ tumor.   Bilateral renal involvement is considered Stage V disease3.
Relapse rates are relatively low with 10-15% experiencing relapse in patients with favorable histologic findings.  They increase up to 50% in patients with anaplastic findings3.
