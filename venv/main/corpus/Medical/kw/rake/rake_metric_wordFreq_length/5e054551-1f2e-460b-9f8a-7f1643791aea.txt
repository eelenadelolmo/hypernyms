In most cases treatement is comprised of medical management of symptoms.
Radiosurgery is an option for lesions not associate with venous angiomas (which subserve normal brain). 
Surgerical resection is indicated for severe lesions.
Multiple axial MR images demonstrate a lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere which has a dark outer margin on all sequences. The remainder of the lesion has a coarsely heterogeneous signal intensity on the T1 sequence.  The T2 bright signal within this lesion shows a characteristic "popcorn" like configuration.  Axial GRE image demonstrates magnetic susceptibility "blooming."
Cavernous Malformation (preferred name)
â€¢Cavernous Malformation (a.k.a. Cavernous Angioma, Cavernous Hemangioma, Cavernoma)
â€¢Hemorrhagic Metastasis
Not reported by author.

However, patient's with studies similar to the one presented for review here can present with headache or seizures
The internal portion of the lesion contains intravascular lacunes of stagnant or slow flowing blood and extravascular blood products in various stages of degradation.  The dark outer ring that is most prominent on the gradient sequence is due to hemosiderin.
