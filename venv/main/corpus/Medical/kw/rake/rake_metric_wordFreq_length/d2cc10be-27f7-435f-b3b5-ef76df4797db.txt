The patient is in good general condition and he is seizure-free after surgery.
Conventional multiplanar MR Imaging demonstrates a cortically-based mass lesion in the anteromedial portion of the left temporal lobe. The lesion is hyperintense on T2-weighted  and FLAIR sequences, possibly containing a small cystic space in the medial portion. On T1-weighted sequence the lesion is slightly hypointense compared to gray matter signal intensity. There is no edema or mass effect in the surrounding brain parenchyma. Following contrast administration, the mass enhances strongly and homogeneously, except from the small cystic region in the medial aspect of the mass. 
The imaging findings are more compatible with a  low-grade intra-axial neoplasm
Anaplastic ganglioglioma (WHO grade III)
ganglioglioma
low-grade diffuse  astrocytoma
oligodendroglioma

An otherwise healthy 14-year old boy presents with 1-month history of complex partial seizures.
In the clinical setting of complex partial seizures, ganglioglioma is one of the most common tumors we have to think, despite the fact that the typical imaging appearance of a circumscribed cyst with mural nodule is not present. In this case , a major differential diagnosis would be diffuse low grade astrocytoma.
