Abscess was incised and drained with ~3 mls serosanguinous/pus fluid removed.  Patient was started on clindamycin 150 mg q8hrs for 14 days.  Patient was markedly improved clinically immediately following I/D.  Cultures were positive for gram positive cocci in singles and pairs consistent with Group A Beta Hemolytic Streptococci.  Patient was discharged POD#3.
The is an irregularly margined fluid collection in left lateral retropharyngeal space measuring 1.3 x 2.7 cm at its level of greatest area in the axial plane. Although the slice thickness is not noted the lesion extends from the nasopharynx to the oropharynax and in all likelyhood inferiorly in the retropharyngeal space.  There is only minimal enchancement of the margin of the lesion.
Retropharyngeal abscess
Retropharyengeal abscess, 
cellulitis, 
necrotic liquifactive lymph nodes
branchial cleft cyst.
Patient reported 1 ? weeks of sore neck and mild throat pain that became acutely severe the night prior to initial presentation.  Patient complained of inability to move neck secondary to pain and mother noticed left sided neck fullness and reported intermittent fevers.   On presentation, a lateral X-ray showed increased retropharyngeal space width and CT demonstrated phlegmon vs. abscess.  Patient was I/D’d 2 days prior to this study with no pus drainage and no clinical improvement.  Patient was started on IV clindamycin on admission.
