32 year old man presents to the general surgery clinic with left groin pain.
Due to the malrotation of the bowel it is possible tha the left groin pain could be due to an inflammatory condition such as appendicitis.  Although the appendix was not visualized on this exam, there were no finding to indicate inflammation.  There was a small fat filled left inguinal hernia noted on the CT exam.
