Texto: 
1. Severe dilatation of fourth ventricle (large cyst)
2. No dilatation of lateral/third ventricles (not shunt failure)
3. Ventricular shunt and chronic distortion of left > right cerebral hemispheres are new compared with head ultrasound from years ago (no other studies available)
Trapped or Encysted Fourth Ventricle = chronic sequela from old intraventricular hemorrhage
