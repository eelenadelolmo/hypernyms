Biliary colic consists of right upper quadrant pain occuring 15-30 minutes after a meal.  Pain typically is less than 4 hours duration and is not associated with fever or leukocytosis.  Ultrasound imaging demonstrates the presence of gallstones without gallbladder wall thickening.  HIDA scan shows visualization of the gallbladder within 4 hours.  Treatment usually consists of laporascopic cholecystectomy.  For patients with contraindications to surgery, a combination of chenodeoxycholic acid with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) or UDCA alone can dissolve multiple small (<5 mm) stones in up to 60% of patients with a functioning gallbladder.  Efficacy is lower with calcified stones.  Stones dissolve at a rate of 1mm per month.
The gallbladder is distended with multiple mobile, round, hyperechoic shadowing stones. No pericholecystic fluid is present.  There is no intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
