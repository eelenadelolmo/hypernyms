Physical exam is significant for weight less than the 10th percentile for age and no palpable masses.
Patient was referred immediately back to his pediatrician who arranged for inpatient admission. Patient underwent surgical repair the following morning with no complications.
Selected longitudinal ultrasound images of the gastric antrum and pylorus demonstrate pyloric hypertrophy and stenosis. The single wall thickness is 4mm (< 3mm normal). The pyloric length is 16 mm (< 15mm normal).  An early “cervix sign” is suggested on image #1, as the hypertrophied pylorus pushes into the antrum. “Shouldering” of the antrum is noted at the distal stomach on all of the images. Prolonged real time examination demonstrated frequent exaggerated peristaltic waves and no passage of fluid through the stenosed gastric outlet.
Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis
Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis

Infantile Pylorospasm (Wall Thickness 1.5-3mm with partial outlet obstruction and only delayed gastric emptying)
4 week old male has been experiencing projectile vomiting for 5 days. Parents complain of increased fussiness, decreased urine frequency, and progressive infant fatigue. Emesis is non-bilious and is almost always the same consistency of the infant’s most recently ingested feeds.
Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) is the most common acquired cause of gastrointestinal obstruction in the infant. Physiologically, HPS is idiopathic hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the circular muscle fibers of the pylorus with extension into the gastric antrum. There is an increased incidence in firstborn males and the condition may be inherited in some affected infants as a dominant polygenic trait. The condition is typically not congenital but rather develops over the first 2-8 weeks of life. The prototypical affected patient presents around 4-6 weeks of life with non-bilious intractable projectile vomiting. A palpable olive-shaped mass will be present in the right upper quadrant of up to 80% of affected patients. 

Ultrasonography is an excellent means of making the diagnosis non-invasively. On longitudinal imaging through the pylorus, signs of HPS include the cervix sign (indentation of pyloric muscle into the fluid-filled antrum), double track sign (parallel hypoechoic muscle layers with double adjacent echogenic mucosal layers internally), single wall thickness  > 3mm, pyloric canal length > 15mm, exaggerated peristaltic waves in the gastric antrum (with little to no fluid passage through the closed outlet), and shouldering or flattening of the pre-pyloric antrum over the hypertrophic pylorus. Transverse imaging may demonstrate the target sign (hypoechoic ring of pyloric muscle around the echogenic mucosa) and a transverse pyloric diameter > 13mm when closed. 

UGI can also make the diagnosis with great accuracy but it is technically more difficult and invasive to the patient. Findings on UGI typically parallel those described on US.  Elongation and narrowing of the canal, the string sign (passing of small contrast streak through canal), total transverse wall thickness > 10mm, caterpillar sign (hyperperistaltic waves in the stomach), and antral beaking (mass impression on antrum with small amount of contrast in proximal canal, similar to cervix sign described on US) have all been described as findings consistent with HPS on UGI examinations. 

Treatment is surgical and prognosis is usually quite good.
