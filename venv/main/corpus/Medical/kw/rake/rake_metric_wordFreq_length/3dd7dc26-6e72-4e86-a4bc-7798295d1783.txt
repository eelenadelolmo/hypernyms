Periorbital and facial edema and contusion.
Treatment involves reduction of the rotational deformity with fixation of the facial buttresses to restore the malar prominence and orbital volume.
CT of the facial bones demontrates fractures of the lateral orbital wall at the zygomaticofrontal suture, orbital floor in the region of the zygomaticomaxillary suture and zygoma.  There is a rotational deformity of the fracture fragment.
