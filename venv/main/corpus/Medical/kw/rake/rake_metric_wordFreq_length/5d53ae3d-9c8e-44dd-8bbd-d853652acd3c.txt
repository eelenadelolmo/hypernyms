Texto: 
Treatment usually consists of curettage or excision with wide margins and the use of adjuvants such as phenol and argon beam coagulation. Bone cement also, theoretically decrease recurrence and provides stability to the resected area. Recurrence rates with these measures vary between 5% and 15%.
Geographic,lytic,eccentric, expansile lesion at the femoral metaphysis extending to the joint surface.
