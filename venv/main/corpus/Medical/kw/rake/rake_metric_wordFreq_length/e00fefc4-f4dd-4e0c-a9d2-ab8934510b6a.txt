Texto: 
Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline.
Treatment for Paget disease focuses on interfering with osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity. Medications include calcitonin, an inhibitor of bone resorption and EHDP (disodium etidronate) which incorporates into the bone matrix and inhibits both resorption and mineralization.
Lateral radiograph of skull and axial views of skull (bone windows) show characteristic "cotton wool" appearance, calvarial thickening, coarsened trabeculation and bony expansion.
Paget's Disease
Metastatic disease
Hyperphosphatasia
70 year old man
The diagnosis of Paget disease of bone can be confirmed by radiographic appearance (as in this case) in addition to supporting laboratory values (elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and serum hydroxyproline).

Metastatic disease would not be as diffuse and regular as this appearance, typically.

Familial Idiopathic Hyperphosphatasia is a disease of youth ("Juvenile Paget Disease") that has no relationship to adult Paget disease of bone, but exhibits similar radiographic features: symmetric thickening of cortices of the long and short tubular bones; and, marked thickening of cranial vault and base. Serum alkaline phosphatase levels are elevated but calcium and phosphorus levels are normal.

Complications from Paget disease include: 
-deformity of bone, fracture, or neurologic compromise secondary to bone expansion and compression of neurologic structures (cord, nerve roots, cranial nerves) 
-neoplasms associated with Paget disease include sarcomatous degeneration and giant cell tumors

-arthridities: crystalline deposition (gout, CPPD), rheumatoid, ankylosing spondylitis, degenerative joint disease
