Crossed fused ectopia
N/A.
72 Y/O MALE with hematuria.
Crossed fused renal ectopia is a congenital anomaly which is normally asymptomatic.  It does however, place the patient at greater risk in the event of injury to the single kidney.  In this case, the CT demonstrates the anomaly but does not reveal the etiology of the patient's hematuria.
