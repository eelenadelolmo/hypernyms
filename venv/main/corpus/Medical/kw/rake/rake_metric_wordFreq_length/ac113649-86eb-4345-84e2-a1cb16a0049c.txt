Painless mass of the left ankle, an ultrasound was requested.
The patient is treated with intravenous antibiotics and surgical debridement.
Ultrasound demonstrates a soft tissue mass in the left ankle with calcifications, increased articular space, irregularity of articular surface and increased power doppler signal.
Radiographic findings correlate with sonographic findings, also showing decreased bone density.
CHRONIC OSTEOMYELITIS CAUSED BY STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS.
- Coccidioides osteomyelitis
- Tuberculous osteomyelitis
- Neuropathic joint
- Intraarticular chondrosarcoma
