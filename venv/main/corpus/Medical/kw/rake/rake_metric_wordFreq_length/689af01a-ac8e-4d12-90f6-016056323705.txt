RADIOLOGIC FINDINGS: axial CT of abd w/contrast 
  4 cm rounded solid mass in upper left kidney with extracapsular spread. Likely renal cell carcinoma. No
  evidence of regional lymphadenopathy or renal vein involvement. Evidence of left perirenal hematoma -
  resolving. Liver and lungs normal. 
  Multiple bilateral renal cysts, 6.5 by 5cm on right.
Renal cell carcinoma
primary tumors: 
  -oncocytoma - indistinguishable from renal cell ca preoperatively. 
  -Angiomyolipoma - usually have fat density on CT 
  -Transitional cell ca -usually in renal pelvis and collecting system 
  -Adrenal tumors 
  -simple cyst -smooth, thin wall on CT, sharply demarcated, no contrast uptake 

  secondary tumors: 
  -metastatic disease - lung, breast, stomach ca 
  -lymphoma
Request CT Abdomen with contrast. 
  60 yo male had a large left perinephric hematoma after mild blunt trauma. Unable to evaluate left kidney on prior study. Please evaluate.
Renal cell ca is relatively rare, comprising 2.3% of all adult cancers. It affects males twice as often as females and incidence peaks in the sixth decade of life. Renal tumors are being detected more commonly as incidental findings with the increased use of CT. Symptomatic patients may present with flank pain, hematuria, and/or abdominal mass. This tumor invades perinephric tissue but has not metastasized to regional nodes or to distant sites. The stage is thus T3aN0M0. 
  The treatment for renal cell ca is radical nephrectomy. Patients with tumors extending beyond the renal capsule have a 50% disease-free survival 5 yrs postoperatively. The cysts seen bilaterally are benign and have no association with the malignancy. 
 This case emphasizes the importance of follow-up studies, since the patient's initial CT showed a perirenal hematoma obscuring the left kidney.
