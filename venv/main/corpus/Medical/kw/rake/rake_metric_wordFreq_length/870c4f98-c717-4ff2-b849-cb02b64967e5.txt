Findings: Axial unenhanced chest CT demonstrates a well-circumscribed soft tissue mass at the right thoracic paravertebral space with evidence of osseous lytic involvement of the adjacent vertebral body.  MR images done for further evaluation demonstrate a T1 hypointense, T2 heterogeneously hyperintense, and avidly heterogeneously enhancing lesion at the right paravertebral space with T7 vertebral body involvement. Overall, this is an aggressive extradural process that favor a neoplastic and, much less likely, given that the patient had no symptoms attributed to this lesion, an infectious process.
Chordoma
