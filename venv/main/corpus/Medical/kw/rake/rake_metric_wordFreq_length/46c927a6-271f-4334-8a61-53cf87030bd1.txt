Texto: 
Patient not conscious, intubated, responding to pain in multiple locations.
Serial AP chest radiographs demonstrated gradual improvement in LLL collapse.
Marked lucency of the left chest with truncation and slight horizontal elevation of the left main stem bronchus.  Compensatory prominent appearance of right lung pulmonary vasculature, secondary to shunting from collapsed left lung.
Left Lower Lobe Collapse
Left lower lobe collapse secondary to
obstructing lesion i.e. mucus plug, blood clot, endobronchial lesion or extrinsic bronchial compression.
43 year old man admitted to the surgical ICU after sustaining a fall off of a two story roof the day before.  Patient stabilized initially at hospital closer to the accident; and , he was then transferred to our institution.
This individual&#39;s left lower lobe collapse was most likely secondary to mucus plugging after intubation or obstructing blood clot which developed after his fall.
