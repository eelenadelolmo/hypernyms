Recommend correlation with history and biopsy as needed
Not Shown: No new lung mass (atelectasis)
Right sided, slightly hyperdense 2cm mid renal mass with iso-hypo metabolic activity relative to the rest of the kidney.

Shown: PET/CT images of four Cutaneous and Subcutaneous masses with increased metabolic activity with SUV approximately 2.5. Which had enlarged slightly since the CT examination almost 2 years prior.
