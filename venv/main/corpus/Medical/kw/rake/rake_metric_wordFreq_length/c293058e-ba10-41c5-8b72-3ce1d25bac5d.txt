Adenomyomatosis is a benign condition characterized by hyperplastic changes of unknown etiology involving the gallbladder wall and causing overgrowth of the mucosa, thickening of the muscular wall, and formation of intramural diverticula or sinus tracts termed Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses. Adenomyomatosis is a common tumorlike lesion of the gallbladder with no malignant potential and may involve the gallbladder in a focal, segmental, or diffuse form.
