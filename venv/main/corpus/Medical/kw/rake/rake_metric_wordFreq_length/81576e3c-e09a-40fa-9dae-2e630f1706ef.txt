Texto: 
Minimal fever.  Remainder of examination unremarkable.
This patient is newly diagnosed and undergoing treatment.  Routine surveillance imaging will be performed to document progression or resolution.
Bilateral hilar adenopathy with right paratracheal adenopathy.  No parenchymal disease evident.
Sarcoid - Confirmed via biopsy.
Sarcoidosis
Lymphoma
TB (although this patient is PPD negative)
Metastatic disease
Pneumoconiosis (silicosis, berylliosis)
Leukemia
26 yo African-American female presents with fever and "flu-like" symptoms.  No unusual occupational exposures.  Acute onset of symptoms.  No weight loss.  Non-smoker. HIV and PPD negative.
These radiographs exhibit the classic "1-2-3 sign" of bilateral hilar adenopathy and right paratracheal adenopathy seen most frequently in sarcoidosis.  As this patient only exhibits adenopathy without evidence of lung parenchymal involvement, this would be categorized as stage 1 sarcoidosis.
