26 yo African-American female presents with fever and "flu-like" symptoms.  No unusual occupational exposures.  Acute onset of symptoms.  No weight loss.  Non-smoker. HIV and PPD negative.
These radiographs exhibit the classic "1-2-3 sign" of bilateral hilar adenopathy and right paratracheal adenopathy seen most frequently in sarcoidosis.  As this patient only exhibits adenopathy without evidence of lung parenchymal involvement, this would be categorized as stage 1 sarcoidosis.
