An MRI demonstrated a retro-ocular, intraconal mass on the right. A biopsy was performed and followed by tumor resection six weeks later.
Fig 1. Fat suppresed T1 axial MRI showing the retro-ocular, intraconal mass.  

Fig 2. Gross resection specimen showing the mass surrounding the optic nerve.

Fig 3. Histological section showing whorls of neoplastic cells abutting on the surface of the optic nerve.

Fig 4. Higher magnification showing the indistinct cytoplasmic margins, vesicular nuclei and occasional intranuclear vacuoles.
Optic nerve meningioma - intraconal
Differential Dx for Intraconal Mass:
<li>Optic nerve glioma (fusiform enlarged optic nerve w/enhancement)
<li>Optic nerve meningioma (surrounds a normal nerve)
<li>Optic nerve metastases
<li>Granulomatous disease
<li>Schwannoma and Neurofibroma (NOT intrinsic to ON - but may be adjacent)
This 50 year old woman had double vision in all gaze directions and decreased visual acuity in the left eye.
The differential diagnosis for intraconal masses centered on the ON should be focused on glioma (astrocytoma) and optic sheath meningioma.

Optic sheath meningiomas surround a normal or nearly normal diameter ON.  Gliomas often cause fusiform enlargement of the ON and abnormal enhancement.

In this case, the ON is NOT enhancing, and the mass appears to surround the nerve.

Optic gliomas in children are usually pilocytic astrocytomas, and >50% are associated with NF-1.

Optic nerve meningiomas classically surround a nerve of normal size and shape - producing a "stuffed olive" appearance.

Although this patient was treated with resection, other options include stereotactic radiotherapy:
