Texto: 
Unstable ankle.
Treatment will consist of internal screw fixation of the distal syndesmosis and posterior malleolus, followed by casting for several weeks.
Diffuse soft tissue swelling.  Communited fracture of the proximal fibula metadiaphysis.  Minimally-displaced posterior distal tiba fracture.  Medial and lateral malleoli are intact.  Possible old healed ligamentous injury to lateral malleolus.  Distal syndesmosis not wide.  Mortise symmetric / talar dome intact.

-Synchronous, isolated proximal fibular & posterior  malleolar fx.
Twisting injury to the ankle. Cannot bear weight.  Pain also laterally, just below the knee.
The instability of this injury can be underestimated by the radiographs, which do not demonstrate well the underlying ligamentous, syndesmotic, and interosseous disruption.  Often this fracture pattern is seen with a medial malleolar fracture, but in this case the deltoid ligament was disrupted instead.  The fracture of the fibula is proximal, where the force transmitted up and disrupting the interosseous ligament exits. Widening of the distal syndesmosis may also not be apparent. Looking just at the ankle then, this can give the appearance of an apparent "isolated" posterior malleolar fracture on plain radiographs, as in this case, and one must then look at the proximal fibula for the inevitable associated fracture.
