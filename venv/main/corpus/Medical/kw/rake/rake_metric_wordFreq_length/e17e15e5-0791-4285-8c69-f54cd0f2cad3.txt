37 year old man felt a pop in his knee; his knee began giving out four days later.  Felt constant pain, and there was no change with conservative treatment.
This case is interesting in that this injury seems to have occured atraumatically, with features of "O'donoghue's unhappy triad" not in the context of trauma.
