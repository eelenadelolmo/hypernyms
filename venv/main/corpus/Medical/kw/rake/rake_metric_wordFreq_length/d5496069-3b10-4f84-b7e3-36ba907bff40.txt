AFVSS
HEENT: WNL
Mild enlargement of several bilateral axillary lymph nodes.
Pt scheduled to follow up with GI for video-assisted thoracoscopic excision of the cyst, but he did not return for further appointments.
Well circumscribed, homogeneous mass along the distal esophagus. The margins of this mass appear to be nearly at a right angle to slightly obtuse angle with the esophageal wall.  In other words, not an acute margin.  This is not a mucosal based mass. but rather a submucosal (intramural) or a lesion extrinsic to the esophagus.
Foregut Malformation Cyst
• Foregut cyst (GI, bronchogenic)
• Leiomyoma (other mesenchymal tumors less likely)
• Pericardial cyst
32 y.o. man with a c/o dysphagia x 3days.  Denies fever/chills/wt loss.  (-)Odynophagia .

Denies tobacco use/social ETOH
Since the lesion was not resected, the specific type of foregut cyst could not be determined.
