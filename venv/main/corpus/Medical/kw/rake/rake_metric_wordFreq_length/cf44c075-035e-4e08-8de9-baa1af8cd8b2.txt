CXR: Dextrocardia is present with the stomach bubble on the normal, left, side of the patient.  No evidence of pneumonia.

CT: Dextrocardia without evidence of situs inversus. A persistent left sided SVC is seen with complete agensis of the left brachiocephalic vein.  The left SVC can be followed to the point where it drains into the coronary sinus.
Persistent Left Superior Vena Cava (PLSVC)
The differential diagnosis of a abnormal vessel seen on chest CT to the left of the arch of the aorta would include:
Persistent Left Superior Vena Cava
Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return
