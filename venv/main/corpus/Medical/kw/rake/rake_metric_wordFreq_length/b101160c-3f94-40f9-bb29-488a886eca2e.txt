Texto: 
Tenderness to palpation over bilateral distal tibiae. Minimal swelling.
Stress fractures are most effectively prevented by increasing the level of exercise slowly, adequately warming up and stretching before exercise, and using cushioned insoles and appropriate footwear. 

Treatment involves rest of the injured bone, followed by a gradual return to activity once free of pain. Recent evidence supports the use of air splinting to reduce pain and decrease the time until return to full participation or intensity of exercise. (Am Fam Physician 2003;68:1527-32.

• Plain Radiographs:
R Tib/Fib PA/Lateral - periosteal elevation, cortical thickening 
L Tib/Fib PA/Lateral - periosteal elevation, cortical thickening, sclerosis, and a true transverse fracture line 30% through distal third diaphysis

• Radionuclide Bone Scan
Increased radiotracer uptake on both flow and blood pool images in regions of right mid tibia and left distal third tibia.
The hemi-body images as well as spot tib/fib images demonstrate R mid tibial grade III stress fracture and a L distal third grade IV stress fracture.
Tibial Stress Fracture - bilateral, R mid tibial grade III and L distal third grade IV
Given the plain radiographic findings combined with 3-phase positive nuclear medicine Tc99-HDP study, the diagnosis of stress fracture is straight forward.
18 year old active duty man with 1 month history of worsening bilateral shin pain. No known trauma. Recent aggressive running.
