46 yo woman with a 15 year history of breast cancer referred to radiology for followup evaluation.
Liver metastases from breast cancer is usually a late finding and as this case indicates, possible other metastases have already occurred to other organ systems1,2.  It is therefore essential to have diligent follow up of treated primary breast cancer patients.   Thorough history and physical (review of system for systemic recurrence, and complete physical looking for locoregional recurrence) is recommended every 3-6 months for the first 3 years post primary therapy and then every 6-12 months for 2 years and then annually3.  Mammography should be taken every 6 months after radiation treatment if the patient had breast conserving surgical treatment.  Yearly mammography should be taken for those that did not have breast conserving surgery3.  Patients should also conduct monthly breast examinations3.  Pelvic examination should be conducted regularly, but could be extended if patient has had total hysterectomy and oophorectomy3.  If the patient had isolated and single liver metastases then the patient may be a good candidate for surgical resection.  However, due to possibility of extrahepatic lesions and numerous liver metastases, the patient in the case is not a good surgical candidate1,2.
