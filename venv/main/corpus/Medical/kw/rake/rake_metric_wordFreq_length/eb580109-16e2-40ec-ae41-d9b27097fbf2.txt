She recovered successfully from the appendectomy.  After improving her poor nutrition, she had an open abdominal surgery and this was found in her stomach extending down to her cecum. She was not happy afterwards because she liked the dietary intake restrictions that the bezoar allowed!
Rapunzel Syndrome (Gastric Bezoar extending to cecum)
25 yo female who had trichophagia. First admission for acute appendicitis, the bezoar was noted on a CT scan . She had about 100 lbs wt loss and could only tolerate about a tablespoon of liquid at a time. She had her appendix removed acutely and at that operation; and, the bezoar could be palpated in the distal ileum at the ileocecal valve.
