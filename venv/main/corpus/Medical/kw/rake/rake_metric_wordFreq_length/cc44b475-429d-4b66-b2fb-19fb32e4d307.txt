- Thin appearing male
- Coarse breath sounds
- Non-labored respirations, no grunting, stridor, retractions, wheezing, or cough
Following diagnosis of vascular ring, this patient was referred to a tertiary care center for further evaluation of treatment options.  The patient is currently awaiting a treatment plan.
Upper GI demonstrates a posterior indentation in the esophagus.  CT with contrast demonstrates a right-sided aortic arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery coursing behind the esophagus causing significant narrowing.  3-D reconstructions demonstrate the ligamentum arteriosum (arrow) completing the vascular ring.
Vascular Ring
• Vascular ring
• Aortic arch aneurysm
• Foregut cyst
• Lymphoma
• Neuroblastoma
• Metastasis
