Pelvic floor evaluation.
This patient was diagnosed with mild Hiatus enlargement based on the measurement of the H-line (see image description).  This is measured on the straining images (with valsalva).  Grading is as follows:

Grade 0 (normal)    <6 cm
Grade 1 (mild)           6-8
Grade 2 (moderate)   8-10
Grade 3 (severe)       >= 10

She was also diagnosed with a mild cystocele based on the 2 cm distance measured of the bladder below the H-line (see image description).  The grading is as follows for any organ below this line:

Grade 0 (no prolapse)   
Grade 1 (mild)            0-2 cm
Grade 2 (moderate)     2-4 cm
Grade 3 (severe)       >= 4 cm

Her final diagnosis was mild pelvic floor descent (also measured with strain).  This is the distance of the M-line - see image description.  Grading is as follows:

Grade 0 (normal)  0-2 cm
Grade 1 (mild)         2-4
Grade 2 (moderate)  4-6
Grade 3(severe)       >=6
