21 year old man presents to the emergency department with complaint of disorientation and increased blood alcohol level.  No evidence of trauma.
Choroid plexus neoplasms usually present under the age of 5.  They arise from or within the normal choroid, and therefore should touch the roof of the 4th ventricle.  Ependymomas of the 4th usually arise from the floor of the ventricle.
