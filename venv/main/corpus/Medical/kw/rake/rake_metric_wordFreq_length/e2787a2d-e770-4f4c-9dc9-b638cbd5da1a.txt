Coil embolization
Biliary drainage catheter present which traverses a posterior branch of the right hepatic artery. Directed catheter/microcatheter arteriogram demostrates contrast flow from the artery into the drainage catheter. 

Coil embolization of the lacerated artery, with multiple platinum coils ranging in size from 3x3 to 5x6.
Hepatic Artery Laceration confirmed at angiography
Hepatic arterial laceration
Portal venous laceration
