MRI recommended to define between Bicornuate and Septated Uterus.
The uterus appears normal in echotexture and size measuring approximately 8 cm in the long axis.  There appear to be two uterine cavities in the fundal area with hypoechoic area between.  One cervix was visualized.
 
Transabdominal imaging of the kidney was also obtained with demonstration of tissue crossing the anterior portion to the aorta with continuous and similar
echotexture of the bilateral kidneys.
Horshoe Kidney
Bicornuate Uterus
Horseshoe Kidney
Bicornuate Uterus
Septated Uterus
Menorrhagia work up to include US for pelvic congenital anomalies. Pt with known history of renal anomaly.
This patient had a known horsehoe kidney from an incidental finding from a previous study. Because there is an increased incidence of other congenital anomalies with a horseshoe kidney, the patient's symptom of menorrhagia suggested a study of the pelvic organs which revealed a probable bicornuate uterus
