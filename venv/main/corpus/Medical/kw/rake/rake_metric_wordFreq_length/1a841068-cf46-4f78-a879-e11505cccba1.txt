Texto: 
Physical remarkable only for lower abdominal/pelvic TTP.

CBC, CMP within normal limits.

UA with trace leukocyte esterase, moderate bacteria/HPF and 1 WBC but also with 30 epithelial cells/HPF.

Qualitative BHCG - Positive.

Serum BHCG - 6350 mIU/mL.
The case was discussed directly with the OB-GYN staff who reviewed the images with the Radiology team.  As the patient was hemodynamically stable, the decision was made to treat with Methotrexate 95 mg IM x1 dose. The patient will be followed with serial BHCG levels to ensure that values return to baseline.
Uterus demonstrates decidual reaction but no gestational sac.

Thick-walled structure in the left adenexa with internal hypoechoic cystic focus and surrounding hyperemia consistent with an ectopic pregnancy.
Ectopic Pregnancy
Early intrauterine pregnancy - before quantitative results
Ectopic pregnancy
Heterotopic pregnancy
24 year-old woman with lower abdominal pain that brought her to the ER during a business trip to the area.  She reports a prior right fallopian tube ectopic pregnancy 2 years earlier that was treated with surgery that spared her right ovary.  She notes that this pain feels different.
While not a known diagnosis for the patient, 2 ectopic pregnancies, with 1 on each side is concerning for pelvic inflammatory disease among other etiologies.  Cultures for sexually transmitted diseases are pending.  If she desires to conceive, hysterosalpingogram may help to define whether her anatomy is normal.
