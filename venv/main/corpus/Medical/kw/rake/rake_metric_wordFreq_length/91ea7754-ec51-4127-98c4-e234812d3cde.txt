Texto: 
Patient not seen by radiology so no physical examination was performed.No laboratory tests ordered on this visit.  Studies of the previous year included:     Amylase/Lipase low normal                     
Vitamin A: 0.16 (0.3-0.65 ng/L)    Carotene: 0 (4-51 ug/dL)                          
Vitamin E: 2.4 (5-20 ng/L)    
History of multiple sputum cultures positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Close follow up is required.  Breathing exercises and chest percussions help preserve lung function.  DNAse treatment promotes mucus clearance while inhaled beta-agonists or anti-cholinergics increase airflow.  Aggressively diagnose and treat any pulmonary infection to decrease morbidity and mortality.  Mild infections are treated on an outpatient basis but severe or resistant infections require IV antibiotic administration.  Patients also benefit from administration of pancreatic enzyme and fat soluble vitamin replacement.1
Trachea is midline.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  Bony structures are without abnormality.  A catheter is noted entering the right subclavian vein with the tip in the superior vena cava.  Cardiac borders are well delineated.  The costophrenic angles are clear.  No evidence of effusion or infiltrate.  There are diffuse thickened airway walls, seen most prominently in the upper lobes, right greater than left.  Tram tracking is present, consistent with bronchiectasis.  Minor fissure is elevated on the right indicating loss of volume of the right upper lobe.
Cystic fibrosis with bronchiectasis
Cystic fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, advanced sarcoidosis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis
Asymptomatic 20 y/o male with known history of lung disease presents for pre-operative evaluation
