Observation
AP/LAT FEMUR:  2 cm and 1.5 cm well defined, irregular sclerotic lesions in the central diaphysis of the Right Femur. There is a narrow transition zone with no cortical destruction, endosteal scalloping or peristeal/soft tissue changes.
MRI: clustered nodules with irregular shape having high T2 signal intensity and lobulated border with areas of low signal consistent with chondroid calcified matrix.  No endosteal, periosteal or soft tissue changes seen.
Enchondroma
1)Echondroma
2)Bone infarct (no serpiginous sclerotic border)
3)low-grade chondrosarcoma (not axial, epiphyseal, or proximal location; not painful; not large; no destructive cortical changes)
29 y/o male with thigh injury with incidental finding on xray of enchondroma.
The findings of this case are typical for enchondroma.  Not being at a higher risk location, asymptomatic, not large and no destructive cortical or soft tissue changes all favor enchondroma vs. chondrosarcoma.  Observation and periodic follow-up radiographs to assess stability is warranted.
