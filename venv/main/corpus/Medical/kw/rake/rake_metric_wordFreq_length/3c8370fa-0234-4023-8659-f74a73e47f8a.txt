Laboratory:
   (22APR2004) FT4: 2.11 ng/dL   (0.89-1.80 ng/dL)
               TSH: undetectable (0.35-5.50 uIU/mL)

   (10MAY2004) FT4: 1.26 ng/dL  (0.89-1.80 ng/dL)
               TSH: <0.08 uIU/mL (0.35-5.50 uIU/mL)

PE:(11MAY2004)
       No palpable nodules
       No thyroid enlargement
       No tenderness
The treatment is observation and allowing the patient to return to normal, along with symptomatic treatment.  The disease is almost always self limiting with no adverse sequelae, but occasionally it recurs and may result in permanent hypothyroidism.
Dose:   4.86 uCi I-131, PO.
 	4.65 mCi Tc99m-pertechnatate, IV.

Procedure:  Approximately 24 hours prior to imaging, patient was given Iodine-131 PO.  Uptake was calculated with Iodine-131 probe detector at four hours and again at 24 hours.  After 24-hour uptake was obtained, patient was injected with Tc-99m Pertechnetate and planar images and pinhole collimator images were obtained of the thyroid.

I-131 uptake:	 4 hour   3.1% (2-12%)
		24 hour   4.7% (12-30%)

24 hour Tc-99m Scan(11MAY2004):  Decreased but otherwise physiologic-appearing uptake. Given the amount of background activity and the subsequent decreased target to background ratio, the scan demonstrates decreased uptake in the thyroid.
Subacute Thyroiditis
Subacute Thyroiditis
Thyrotoxicosis factitia
Hyperthyroidism caused by iodine ingestion (e.g. amiodarone, iodine-rich contrast agents)
Struma ovarii
43 y/o female with acute onset of agitation, heat intolerance and loose stools, approximately two weeks ago (prior to the day of thyroid uptake/scan). Upon questioning on day of scan, relates having an upper respiratory infection 4-5 weeks prior to having symptoms.
See Factoid.
