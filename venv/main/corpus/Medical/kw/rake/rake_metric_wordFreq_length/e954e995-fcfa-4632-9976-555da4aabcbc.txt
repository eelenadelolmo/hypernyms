Vital Signs: Temp 98.3 F, BP 100/70, P 68, Wt 113lbs
Pulm: Good bilateral air entry with no crackles or wheezes
CV: RRR with no murmurs. No pedal edema.
GI: Soft, non-tender. Positive bowel sounds.
CNS: Alert, oriented x3. No focal neurological deficits.

Esophageal Manometry: Resting LES pressure of 42 mmHg. Relaxation was incomplete in most swallows. Some examples of the wet swallow showed that relaxation is less than 50% and fairly complete in swallow 1. The contractions of the esophageal body were difficult to read with the amplitude no more than 50 mmHg and the waves look like identical questionable isobaric waves versus simultaneous contractions. 
Endoscopy with Biopsy: Normal esophagus, stomach and duodenum with Z-line at 36 cm. There was no difficulty going though the GE junction. Biopsies showed normal esophageal mucosa.
On follow-up, the options for treatment of achalasia including botulinum toxin injection, pneumatic dilation and modified Heller myotomy were discussed with the patient.
The initial scout chest film demonstrates normal heart and lung parenchyma. There is some right retrocardiac "fullness" or displacement of the azyogoesophageal recess.  Colonic gas is seen in the splenic flexure and there is no gastric air. Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant are present. 
After swallowing barium, there is visualization of dilation of the esophagus, marked smooth tapering of the distal esophagus, and delayed emptying. There is evidence of esophagitis in the proximal dilated esophagus.

The patient is a 36 year old woman who presents with a 5-6 year history of dysphagia and with consumption of solids and liquids. Symptoms have been increasing in severity over the last 2-6 months. Pt also reports occasional symptoms of vomiting and heartburn as well as a 5 lb weight loss over the last 6 months.
