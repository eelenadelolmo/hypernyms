Texto: 
Grade II liver laceration, vomiting, aspiration, acetabular fracture, sternal fracture, severe closed head injury.
At the time of discharge patient was awake, following commands, vocal, ambulatory, and exhibiting impulsive behavior.  He was discharged to an outside facility for extensive speech/language and cognitive therapy in the acute rehab setting.
â€¢ Brain 8-08-08 : CT â€“ possible underlying diffuse axonal injury due to scattered diffuse hyperintensities throughout parenchyma of bilateral frontal  and parietal lobes.
â€¢ Brain 8-10-08 : MRI FLAIR â€“ signal hyperintensity within bilateral frontal lobes and body of corpus collosum
â€¢ Brain 8-10-08 : MRI Diffusion â€“ signal hyperintensity within bilateral frontal lobes at grey-white matter junction.
â€¢ Brain 8-10-08 : MRI Gradient Echo â€“ signal dropout in within the bilateral frontal lobes at grey-white matter junction.
Traumatic Brain Injury, Diffuse Axonal Injury
â€¢ Possible underlying diffuse axonal injury
â€¢ Contusion
â€¢ Hemorrhage
40 y.o. man was found unconscious at the scene of car vs. pole MVA. Intubated by paramedics and transferred to our ED, from outside facility.
The patient sustained severe closed head injury and other trauma due to a car vs. pole motor vehicle accident. He was discovered unconscious at the scene and intubated by paramedics. Being rendered unconscious by head trauma is may be associated with subsequent diagnosis of diffuse axonal injury. He received CT imaging the same day (8/8) after being transferred from an outside facility to HMC. This initial scanning revealed the possibility of diffuse axonal injury, but as discussed below, this diagnosis could not be made at that time. The patient had head MRIs two days later (8/10), and the diagnosis could be made by comparing MRI imaging with the prior CT.
