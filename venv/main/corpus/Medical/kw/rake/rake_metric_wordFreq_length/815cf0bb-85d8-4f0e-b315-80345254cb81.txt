CT Findings
Increased portal venous diameter (>13mm)
Portal vein thrombosis
Ascites (not seen on these images)
Enlarged splenic and mesenteric veins (>10mm, 10mm on these images)
Porto-systemic collaterals
Hepatocellular carcinoma (hepatoma) with portal vein invasion and thrombosis
Differential for portal hypertension
Prehepatic
  Portal/Splenic Vein Occlusion
Intraheptic
  Cirrhosis
  Metastatic
  Parasitic
Posthepatic
  Cardiac (CHF, Tricuspid Insufficiency, Conststrictive Pericarditis)
  Hepatic Vein Occlusion (Budd-Chiari)
62 y/o female with liver mass possibly hemangioma on CT scan for 3-phase CT scan of liver to evaluate. Pt with history of chronic Hepatitis B and is at risk for HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma).
Originally suspected hemangioma in this patient with known Hepatitis B infection and vague history of findings of mass discovered in CT performed at another institution.  SPECT imaging with TC99m-RBC for hemagioma not consistent with hemangioma.  Laboratory findings were more consistent with HCC with marked elevation of alpha feto-protein.  Follow-up imaging revealed diffuse involvement of the liver and portal vein invasion/thrombosis.
