Partial Pancreatectomy vs close serial CT monitoring to detect stability in size vs growth (indication for resection).
Small cystic foci in the inferior aspect of the pancreatic uncinate process. Cysts seen to communicate with main pancreatic duct on MRCP and ERCP. No evidence of main pancreatic ductal dilitation
Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Tumor - Branch Type
Pseudocyst, Serous cystadenoma, Mucinous cystadenoma/ cystadenocarcinoma, IPMT - Branch Type
60 YO male. Asymptomatic
IPMT - Branch Type are relatively rare. 70% occur in the uncinate process, less frequently in the tail and body. These occur with equal frequency in males and females and the median age of discovery is 60. These tumors usually contain malignant cells, but their slow growth has created 2 camps of management: one advocating partial pancreatectomy, the other close monitoring with CTs at 3-6 month intervals. The key to diagnosis is to show via ERCP or MRCP that there is connection between the main pancreatic duct with the dilated side branches. The serous and mucinous neoplasms do not show this connection. Aspiration of thick mucinous ductal fluid also supports this diagnosis.
