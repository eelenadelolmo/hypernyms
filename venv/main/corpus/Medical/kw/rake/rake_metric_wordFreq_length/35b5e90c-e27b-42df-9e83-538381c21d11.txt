This 63 year old man had a several month history of lethargy.  He presented to a hospital with the rapid onset of severe headache, nausea and vomiting. On examination, he was markedly lethargic, had decreased visual acuity and diplopia. CT and MRI showed a  large macroadenoma.  The patient was given large doses of steroids and a transphenoidal resection was performed.  At the time of surgery, the tumor was grayish yellow and had foci of liquefaction.
