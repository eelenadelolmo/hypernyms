Patient had a recurrent bleed 4 days later by a nuclear medicine GI bleed study.  Subsequent angiogram demonstrated diffuse hyperemia of the duodenum with extravasation of contrast into a collection of contrast into an ulcer crater without a definite arterial feeding vessel.
Selected angiogram of the gastroduodenal artery demonstrates focal extravasation off of the branch of the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery at the junction of the second and third portions of the duodenum.

Post-embolization angiogram demonstrates no active extravasation.
GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING
N/A
63 year old patient nearing renal failure with fulminant liver failure dueto Augmentin, who presents with duodenal bleed status post upper endoscopyand multiple attempts at injection and cautery of the bleed, now with recurrent hematemesis.
In a patient with active gastrointestinal hemorrhage, the source can be localized and treated through embolization.
