Texto: 
Patient arrived with a GCS of 10T (E4,M5, V1T), C-collar, AMS, temporal bruising, soft/tender BUQ, +BS, stable pelvis, RRR, CTAB, normal rectal tone, no step-offs/deformites of the back .  Vitals stable with BP of 114/98, HR 91, 100% SpO2.  H&H 9.6/27.9, WBC 35.5, UDS +amphetamines, benzodiazepines, oxycodone.
Intraoperative hemostasis of the superior mesenteric vein obtained with atraumatic clamps followed by repair with longitudinal running sutures.
Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) scan positive in RUQ and LUQ for free fluid.

CT abdomen showed fluid around spleen with contrast suggesting active bleed.  Questionable splenic laceration.
Superior Mesenteric Vein laceration
(1) splenic laceration/rupture (2) bowel laceration (3) liver laceration/rupture (4) mesentery hemorrhage (4) pancreas laceration
Pt is a 39-year-old white male who presented to UK ED as a trauma red from OSH following an MVC as a restrained driver, positive LOC.  At OSH, negative head CT but patient became hypotensive and received five liters of fluids.
