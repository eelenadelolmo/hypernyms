Patient presents with back pain and radicular pain along the left 9th rib.
The patient has not had therapy due to the location of the osteochondroma. There is no definite compression of a spinal nerve and therefore conservative management was recommended.
The chest CT shows an exostosis off the vertebral body of T9 which extends into the neural canal. MR confirms a small osteochondroma extending into the spinal canal on the left vertebral body of T9. There is no evidence of significant compression of the spinal cord.
