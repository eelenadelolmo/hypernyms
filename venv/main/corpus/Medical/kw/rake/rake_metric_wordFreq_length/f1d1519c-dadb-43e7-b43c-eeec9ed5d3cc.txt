None for this patient.
ovoid mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion of the right distal femur, with punctuate calcifications.  No endosteal scalloping is noted, and the lesion does not have a serpiginous border
Enchondroma
bone infarct,  enchondroma, low-grade chondrosarcoma
presented for routine f/u after bilateral knee replacements, no complaints of right leg/knee pain
This most likely represents an enchondroma, based on presentation as an incidental finding with this radiographic appearance.  No history of trauma, steroids, renal disease, sickle cell, or other conditions predisposing to bone infarcts was given.
