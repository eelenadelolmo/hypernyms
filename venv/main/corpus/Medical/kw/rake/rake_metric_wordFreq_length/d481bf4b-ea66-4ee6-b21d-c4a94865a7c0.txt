Texto: 
Bilateral breast enlargement, left larger than right.  Discrete mass palpated at the 3 o'clock position of the left breast, near the nipple.  No breast tenderness, skin changes or nipple discharge present.
The initial diagnosis was made by an excisional biopsy, but there were positive margins, so this was followed up by modified radical mastectomy. His surgical margins and lymph nodes were negative at the second surgery, so he did not require subsequent external beam radiation.  The patient is followed closely in the breast care center and has annual follow up mammograms of the right breast.
Standard CC and MLO views of the breasts, with additional magnification views of the left breast were obtained. There is a small amount of fibroglandular tissue in the right retroareolar region, and a considerably larger amount of retroareolar fibroglandular tissue on the left.  Additionally, on the left, there is a 2.0 x 3.0 cm irregular shaped dense mass in the middle third at the 3 0â€™clock position extending posteriorly towards the chest wall.  There are punctuate calcifications associated with this mass.  Magnified views demonstrate to better advantage the irregular, lobular borders, and the associated calcifications.
Papillary carcinoma and DCIS
Intraductal breast carcinoma
Papillary breast carcinoma
DCIS (calcification portion)
