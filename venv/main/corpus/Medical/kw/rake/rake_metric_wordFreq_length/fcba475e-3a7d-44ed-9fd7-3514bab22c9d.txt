Physical and laboratory:  Vitals: temp 38.5, blood pressure 110/82, pulse 127, respiratory rate 16.  Pharynx: symmetric posterior pharynx with tonsillar and pharyngeal erythema; Neck: erythema and edema extending along the left sternocleidomastoid from the angle of the jaw to the sternoclavicular notch.  The area is indurated and tender to palpation.
Lab: WBC 23.9, CRP 29.27, coagulation panel within normal limits.
The patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring but never developed sepsis.  The following day CT of the chest confirmed lung abcess.  The patient was treated with lovenox and IV antibiotics.  She responded well to therapy and was discharged from the hospital after 5 days.  Lovenox and IV antibiotics were continued for 12 weeks. Blood cultures never yielded an organism, and as a result, the patient was labeled Lemierre’s-Like Syndrome rather than Lemierre’s Syndrome.   The patient had a complete recovery and is planning to attend college this fall.
Summary of findings:  CT Neck with thrombosis of left jugular vein from the base of the skull to the subclavian vein.  Lymph nodes in neck are enlarged, left greater and right.   No abscess is visualized.  CT neck 6 days prior without evidence of thrombosis.  CT Chest:  with multiple round peripheral opacities approximately 1 cm in diameter and small left-sided pleural effusion.
Lemierre's-Like Syndrome
Differential Diagnosis: Lemierre’s Like syndrome, Lemierre’s Syndrome
17 Year old girl with 14 days of cough, fever, and sore throat who presents with 5 days of worsening fever, sore throat, and left-sided neck pain.  She had been seen in the same emergency room 6 days prior with complaints of severe sore throat.  CT scan of neck revealed only soft tissue swelling of the left adenoids without focal abscess or vascular abnormality.  The patient was discharged at that time with ENT follow-up, clindamycin, and medrol steroid pack
One interesting feature of this case is that the patient had a CT of the neck 6 days prior that did not demonstrate thrombus at that time.  In the interim, she developed increased pain and edema involving her neck along the border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle highlighting the clinical manifestations associated with the jugular thrombus formation.
