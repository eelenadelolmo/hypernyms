Texto: 
Patient afebrile, but slightly tachycardic with heart rate in the 110-120 range.  O2 Saturation adequate at present.

Chest pain not reproducible with palapation.  Physical exam non-contributory.
Patient given initial dosing with heparin and subsequently started on coumadin.  Treatment is essentially long-term and requires frequent follow-up for labwork and dose adjustment.
Multiple filling defects seen on CT angiography of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with the presence of pulmonary emboli.  Large filling defect seen within the deep venous system of the left lower extremity consistent with a thrombus.
Pulmonary Embolism
Pulmonary Embolism
Deep Venous Thrombosis
With intermittent chest pain post-operative day 4 from laparascopic cholecystectomy.  Patient underwent stress test earlier in the day which was negative for cardiac etiology of pain.
