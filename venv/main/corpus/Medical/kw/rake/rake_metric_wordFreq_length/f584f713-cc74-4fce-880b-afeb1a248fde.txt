A colonoscopy was done prior to CT and pt was subsequently Dxed with FAP (Familial Adenomatous Polyposis).  Pt was then transferred for prophylactic proctocolectomy. Performed LN Bx without proctocolectomy.  Want to Tx CA that patient has now and worry about CA that he will get after resolution of current problem. Pt was transferred to Texas for Tx and f/u in order to be near family
CT abdomen/pelvis: 	
1. 1 cm LLL lobulated nodule 	
2. 8 mm enhancing right hepatic lobe lesion 	
3. Questionable 2.5 cm soft tissue density in cecum which appears contiguous with wall 	
4. Multiple enlarged LN in right common iliac chain and extending to right common femoral chain
Hodgkinâ€™s Lymphoma (nodular lymphocytic predominant)
1. Infection, inflammation, malignancy
2. Likely benign mass; hemangioma vs. adenoma, may be metastatic disease
3. Polyp, CA, feces
4. Lymphoma vs. metastatic disease
19 yo WM with h/o fatigue and exercise intolerance during basic training.  W/U revealed microcytic anemia with heme positive stool. Pt was otherwise healthy with no significant PMHx.
