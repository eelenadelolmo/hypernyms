Texto: 
Well-circumscribed, lucent lesions in the central medullary cavities of the distal 2nd and 3rd digit phalanges and proximal phalanx of the 3rd digit.  The ulnar cortex of the 2nd tuft.  No periosteal reaction or soft tissue calcifications. No internal matrix.  Transverse fracture lines are seen through the residual cortices of the 2nd and 3rd tufts with overlying soft tissue edema.
Enchondromatosis
Multiple enchondromas (Ollier&#39;s disease)
Brown Tumors
Giant cell Tumors
Acute pain and swelling to distal fingers after minor trauma.
