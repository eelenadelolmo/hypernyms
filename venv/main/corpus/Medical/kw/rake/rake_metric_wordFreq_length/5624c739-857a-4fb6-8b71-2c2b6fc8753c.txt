Venous Thoracic Outlet Syndrome is an uncommon cause of upper extremity deep venous thrombosis. This syndrome can be categorized into two types based on etiology: Primary Venous Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (Paget â€“ Schroetters Disease) or Secondary Venous Thoracic Outlet Syndrome.

The causes of primary venous thrombosis are most likely multi-factorial, and include vein compression by various anatomic anomalies; such as cervical ribs, hypertrophied subclavius muscles and prominent costoclavicular ligaments.
 
The causes of secondary venous thrombosis are many, and include: central venous catheters (most common), venous foreign bodies, trauma, external compression from tumors or lymphadenopathy, neck infections, fibrosing mediastinitis, and radiation therapy.

With continuing irritation of the vessel walls, there is an increased likelihood of venous stasis formation, intimal injury, and hypercoagulability (i.e. â€“ Virchowâ€™s Triad), which subsequently leads to thrombus formation and eventually lumen occlusion.

Primary venous thoracic outlet syndrome is historically seen in the young male population, with the right upper extremity more often affected than the left.  The patient will usually complain of sudden onset arm pain and swelling associated with vigorous exercise. 

Unlike its counterpart, secondary venous thrombosis most often affects older patients and has a more uniform sex distribution. Reported symptoms include: swelling, discoloration, collateral vein dilatation, and aching. Patients with secondary venous thrombosis may have a delay in clinical presentation, which leads in turn, to delayed treatment.

Classic findings of Venous Thoracic Outlet Syndrome on venography include short-segment occlusions involving either the axillary or subclavian veins, and multiple well-defined venous collaterals.

Treatment options for both categories of Venous Thoracic Outlet Syndrome usually involve an integrated approach, which combines conservative modalities such as bed rest, arm elevation and medical anticoagulation, with catheter directed thrombolysis, thrombectomy, balloon angioplasty and surgical decompression.
