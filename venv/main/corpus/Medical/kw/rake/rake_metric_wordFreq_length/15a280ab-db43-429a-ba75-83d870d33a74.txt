Lab results withheld (see answer discussion)
She was treated with IV  Recophin (Ceftriaxone). She has improved, but continues to have mild weakness in the upper arm; and, some difficulty in recognizing persons seen.
The second MRI scan T1 images after Gd injection  shows gyral enhancement over the  temporal and parietal lobes, as well as pia-arachnoid enhancement about the cerebellum.   The involvement of  different vascular territories,   makes a vascular etiology less likely, leaving an inflammatory etiology to be the most likely cause.

• Multiple embolic Infarcts
• Cerebral thrombophlebitis
• Meningo-encephalitis
A 5 y.o. old girl with upper respiratory tract infection and fever had a car accident . The next day she developed convulsions and was admitted to the  hospital.
