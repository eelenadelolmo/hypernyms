Giant cell tumor of bone
20-year old male with 6 month history of progressively worse left lower leg pain. Pain worse with motion. No overlying skin changes or other complaints. Full range of motion in lower extremity.
Giant cell tumor of bone (osteoclastoma) is usually seen in patients over 20 years of age. It is more common in women than men. The classic location is the epiphysis of a long bone. The most commonly affected sites (in order) are the lower end of the femur, upper end of the tibia, and lower end of the radius.
Radiographically, the typical appearance of a giant cell tumor is that of an entirely lytic, expansile lesion in the epiphysis, usually without peripheral bone sclerosis or periosteal reaction. 
Microscopically, the two main components are the so-called stromal cells and giant cells. In addition, focal deposition of osteoid or bone is seen in one third of cases. The giant cells are usually large and may contain 20-30 nuclei. It is the relative number and appearance of the stromal cells, not those of the giant cells, that correlate with the clinical evolution of the tumor. In most reported series, the incidence of clinical malignancy in giant cell tumors is in the range of 10%. Radiation therapy should be reserved only for cases in which surgical removal is impossible, in view of the relatively high number of reported cases of malignant transformation following therapeutic modality.
