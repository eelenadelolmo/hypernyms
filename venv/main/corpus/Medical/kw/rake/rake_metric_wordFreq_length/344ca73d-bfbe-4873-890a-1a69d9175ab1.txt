Not perfomed or not provided.  Radiology resident examination demonstrates right lower extremity swelling relative to the left.
Anticoagulation if patient is able.  If not a filter should be considered.
Near to completely occlusive thrombosis of the right lower extremity from SFJ to pop fossa on ultrasound. CT demonstrates thrombus within the right external iliac, proximal to distal superfical femoral vein and the deep femoral vein perforating branches. Popliteal vein and posterior tibial vein thrombosis as well.
