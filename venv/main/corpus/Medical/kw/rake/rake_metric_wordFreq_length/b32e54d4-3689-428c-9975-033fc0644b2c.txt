Texto: 
Decreased breath sounds at the bilateral lung bases on physical exam and normal labs except BNP of 1020.
None indicated
3.5cm mass in the right retrocardiac lower lobe with areas of macroscopic fat and chunky, "popcorn" calcifications.
Pulmonary Hamartoma
Essentially none, these findings are pathognomonic for pulomary hamartoma and this does not require further workup.
57y/o female presented to the Emergency Department for evaluation of chest pain. Incidentally noted was a right lower lobe lung mass in the retrocardiac region. A Chest CT was ordered for further evaluation.
This large mass had been "missed" for 7 years in a row on AP radiographs. The patient had always been evaluated with a portable AP when she developed congestive heart failure symptoms. On this admission, she was evaluated with a PA and Lateral and the mass in the retrocardiac region was clearly visualized on the lateral.
