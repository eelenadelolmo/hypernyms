Examination of the lumbar spine is remarkable for burst fractures of the L3 vertebral body.  There are multiple fracture fragments. There is mild posterior displacement of a fracture fragment into the spinal canal which does not cause impingement on the thecal sac however does contact the right L3 nerve root.  There is lateral displacement of the fracture fragments with decreased vertebral body height.  There is a fracture lucency through the left L1-3 transverse processes, and the  left T12 rib.  The surrounding soft
tissues are unremarkable.
