Elective Cholecystectomy
Gray scale sonography in long axis of the gallbladder demonstrates a wall-echo-shadow complex consistent with a gallbladder filled with stones.
Cholelithiasis
Porcelain Gallbladder
Emphysematous Cholecystitis
46 y/o Caucasian female with 1 month history of vague post-prandial abdominal pain.
A stone filled gallbladder will frequently produce a wall-echo-shadow (WES) complex that consists of three, arc-shaped lines followed by a shadow.  The first line is echogenic and represents the interface between the gallbladder wall and the liver.  The second is hypoechoic and represents the gallbladder wall itself.  The third is echogenic and arises from the stones.  Although a WES complex is a very reliable sign of a gallbladder filled with stones, it is not possible to demonstrate it in every case.  Therefore it is a useful finding when seen but not useful when absent.
