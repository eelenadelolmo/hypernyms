Texto: 
Diminished left radial pulse with full shoulder abduction.  Normal heme/coag profile.
Treatment in this case will likely require surgical resection of the left first rib.
There is dynamic compression of the left subclavian artery between the left first rib and clavicle, with some post-stenotic dilitation present.  Blood flow velocity to the distal left upper extremity is diminished with arm abduction.  Notible lack of venous flow, even on delayed sequences.

Thoracic Outlet Syndrome
Reflex Symphathetic Dystrophy
Patient had several matted left supraclavicular nodes resected approximately 10 years ago.  She now presents with progressive heaviness and pallor of the left arm, which is exaccerbated by abduction and external rotation at the shoulder. No other significant medical history.  No current medications.
This is a classic case of a young woman with TOS caused by compression of her left subclavian artery (and likely vein-- due to lack of venous enhancement).  Her symptoms were reproducible with dynamic arm postioning to full abduction and external rotation.  The dimunitive arm arteries are directly resultant of the decreased flow.  Many cases of TOS are idiopathic/congential. In this case the patient, while most likely having underlying (albeit clinically silent) TOS, had her symptoms exaccerbated to significance by post-surgical changes resulting from her prior nodal resection.
