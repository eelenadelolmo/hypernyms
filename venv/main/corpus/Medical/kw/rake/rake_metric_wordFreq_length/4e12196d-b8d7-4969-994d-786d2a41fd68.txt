Atrial septal defect repair is indicated in patients with hemodynamically significant atrial septal defects in the absence of severe and irreversible pulmonary hypertension. Surgical repair is the treatment modality of choice. Percutaneous closure is the preferred treatment in patients with ostium secundum atrial septal defects and suitable anatomy.  The operative mortality is < 1% in the absence of significant pulmonary hypertension. Surgical repair in young adults (< 25 years) results in long-term survival rates similar to those of matched controls. Repair in patients older than 40 years does not eliminate the risk of atrial arrhythmias and cerebrovascular accidents. Long-term surveillance is recommended in these patients.
Frontal radiograph of the chest shows cardiomegaly with prominent pulmonary arteries.  The lungs are hypoinflated with bibasilar atelectasis.

Axial CT images show a channel of contrast communicating between the right atrium and left atrium consistent with an atrial septal defect. The main, right, and left pulmonary arteries are enlarged secondary to the left to right shunt through the atrial septal defect.
Atrial Septal Defect causing pulmonary artery hyptertension.
1. Left to right shunt: ASD, VSD, PDA, anomalous pulmonary venous return

2. Severe lung disease: IPF, Emphysema, Pneumoconiosis, Sarcoidosis, Vasculitis, Pulmonary Emboli

3. CHF, Fluid Overload, Renal Failure, Left Atrial Obstruction, Constrictive Pericarditis, MV insufficiency

4.  Obstructive Sleep Apnea

5.  Primary Pulmonary Artery Hypertension
The patient presented with symptoms of dyspnea, easy fatigability, and chest pain.
The cardiomegaly and pulmonary artery hypertension in this patient were secondary to the underlying atrial septal defect.  This patient underwent surgical repair of her atrial septal defect.
