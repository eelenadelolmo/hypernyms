Texto: 
A well-developed in no acute distress.  
There is no adenopathy noted in the cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary areas.  
Lungs are clear.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.  There are no masses, tenderness, or discharge noted on the reconstructed left breast nor in the right breast. Abdomen:  Normoactive bowel sounds.  Soft, nontender, nondistended without any hepatosplenomegaly.  There is no inguinal adenopathy.  Extremities:  Without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Neuro:  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact, otherwise, is nonfocal.
The patient will be followed up by interventional radiology for splenic artery embolization because of the risk of rupture which carries a high mortality rate.
Contrast enhanced biphasic CT scan of the abdomen shows a well circumscribed lesion in the head/body of the pancreas that is highly attenuated in the arterial phase. The lesion measures 3.8 x 3.5 cm which has not significantly changed in size when compared to PET/CT scans dated 10/29/2010 and 6/23/2010, done at an outside facility. There are  feeding and draining vessel in close proximity posteriorly. This enhancing lesion represents a splenic artery aneurysm in the middle region of the splenic artery located in the body of the pancreas.  Pre-contrast study reveals no significant calcification in the vessel walls.
Splenic Artery Aneurysm
• splenic artery aneurysm
• pancreatic pseudocyst
• pseudoaneurysm
This 63 y.o. woman originally presented with breast cancer (ductal carcinoma-in-situ) 3 yrs ago.
This finding of splenic artery aneurysm was an incidental finding during a workup for this patient's metastatic breast cancer. The patient was asymptomatic and did not report abdominal pain. In addition, the mass was not palpated/auscultated during the physical exam. This is not an uncommon presentation for a splenic artery aneurysm as 90% of patients are diagnosed incidentally.

Regarding her breast cancer, 3 years ago she had a biopsy, which revealed a ductal carcinoma with microinvasive disease.  She had done well postoperatively, until this summer when she palpated a left supraclavicular node.  She had a biopsy via FNA, which revealed a metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Her most recent PETCT from one month ago revealed progression as compared to a previous exam five months earlier.
