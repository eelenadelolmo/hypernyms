â€¢ Enlarged pulmonary artery measuring 3.6 cm
â€¢ Large irregular filling defects extend bilaterally throughout upper, middle, and lower lobe pulmonary artery branches.
â€¢ No evidence of lung consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
Pulmonary Emboli

30 y/o otherwise healthy male presents with several week progressive fatigue and dyspnea with minimal effort.
The patient was promptly sent to a pulmonologist and a CT scan of the lungs discovered the presence of emboli.  The patient was hospitalized and started on anticoagulation.  He underwent a full hematological work up which was found to be negative for evidence of coagulopathy.  He did have a history of a 10 hour flight previous to presentation.  He has a strong family history of coagulopathy with both his father and sister having episodes of DVT.
