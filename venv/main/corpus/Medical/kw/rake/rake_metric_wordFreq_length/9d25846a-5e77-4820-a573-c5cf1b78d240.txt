+3 hyperreflexia of the lower extremities
Patient is currently being treated conservatively with pain meds as needed.
MRI of the spine demonstrates proliferation of the dorsal epidural fat associated with complete effacement of the dorsal sub arachnoid space from the T3 - T9 levels which results in moderate central canal stenosis mild ventral cord flattening at the T6-7 level.  There is also multilevel disk disease.
Epidural Lipomatosis
• epidural lipomatosis
• epidural spread of liposarcoma
• extradural lipoma
76 y.o. man presents with back pain and hyperreflexia in the lower extremities.  MRI of brain showed no focal abnormalities.
The cause for this specific case of epidural lipomatosis is currently unknown.  This man is not obease nor does he currently have a diagnosed endocrinopathy.  Additionally, he does not take steriods for some underlying condition.
