â€¢ Metastasis
26 y.o. woman with Crohn disease for 3 years presents now with dyspnea. She has been treated with multiple immunotherapeutic agents.
Although extraintestinal manifestations of Crohnâ€™s Disease is present in about 25% of patients, pulmonary manifestation as nodules has not been widely reported in literature. Most of the extraintestinal manifestations consist of musculoskeletal, dermatological and even ocular kind. Pulmonary manifestation though relatively more common in other Inflammatory Bowel diseases like Ulcerative Colitis is very rare in Crohnâ€™s disease. Recently some cases have been sited in literature [1].
