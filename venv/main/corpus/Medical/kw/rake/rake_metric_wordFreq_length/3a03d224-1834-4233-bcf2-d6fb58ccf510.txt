Twin B OG-tube not properly placed due to inability to advance adequately.
2/6 systolic murmur heard best at the LLSB with fixed S2.
Small anteriorly placed anus. 
Small right thenar eminence.
On day-of-life 2, Twin B underwent surgery to remove the tracheoesphageal fistula and to anastomose the esophagus.  Patient tolerated procedure well and there were no complications.
Serial esophagraphy should be performed at 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year of age since most neonates who undergo surgical correction of TEF/EA will have some degree of esophageal dysmotility.  Other possible complications include stricture formation, fistula recurrence, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
Pt should remain on ranitidine and metoclopramide for up to one year for GERD precaution.
Cardiology will reevaluate ASD at 8 months.
•Chest AP Portable shows an orogastric tube terminating at t4-5, normal stomach bubble position and bowel gas pattern, and multiple skeletal anomalies, including hemivertebra, butterfly vertebra, and fused ribs.

•Skeletal survey shows a hypoplastic right 1st metacarpal.

•Echocardiogram showed a 6mm ASD. EKG was normal.

•US of head is normal.
•Renal/bladder US is normal.
•Barium Enema shows a colon that is patent and normal in caliber.

44 y/o G2P1001 at 36+3 weeks EGA with uncomplicated gestation of twin girls presents to clinic for routine check-up.  Growth US shows Twin A at 2921g (44% on growth curve), Twin B at 2487g (15% on growth curve), and both twins breech with polyhydramnios.  In addition, Twin B has a single umbilical artery.  Mother is taken to OR for primary low transverse caesarian-section. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes are 6 and 9 for Twin A; 6 and 8 for Twin B.  Both twins taken to NICU.
