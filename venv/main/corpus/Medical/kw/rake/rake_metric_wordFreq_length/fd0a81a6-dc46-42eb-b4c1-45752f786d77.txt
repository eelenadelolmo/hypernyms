There are hypoplastic changes of the right pectoralis musculature and abnormalities of the right hand.
N/A
AP and lateral chest radiographs show absence of the right axillary fold, visualized to best advantage on the frontal chest radiograph. A frontal radiograph of the right forearm and hand shows oligodactyly of the right hand, as evidenced by absence of the second and third fingers. These clinical and radiologic findings are compatible with Poland’s syndrome.
Poland's Syndrome
The combination of this chest wall (pectoralis muscle) anomaly and a malformation of the ipsilateral hand is essentially pathognomonic of Poland's syndrome.
A 3-month-old female presents with visible congenital abnormalities of the right anterior chest wall and right upper extremity.
Please refer to the accompanying factoid.
