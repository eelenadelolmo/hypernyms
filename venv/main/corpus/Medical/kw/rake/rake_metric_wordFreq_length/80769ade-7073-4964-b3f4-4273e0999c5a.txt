Texto: 
Nonoperative treatment includes below the knee casting with weightbearing for 3-6 weeks.  Once facet ossifies, usually becomes asymptomatic.  Only successful 1/3 of the time.

Surgical treatment consists of excision or fusion, depending on joint invovled, patient age, and type of coalition.
Multisequence MRI images demonstate fibrous bridging of the middle sub-talar joint with associated edema in the sustenaculum tali.
Tarsal coalition
none
15 y/o male with foot pain.
No plain films obtained prior to MRI as patient came directly from foot/ankle surgeon.
