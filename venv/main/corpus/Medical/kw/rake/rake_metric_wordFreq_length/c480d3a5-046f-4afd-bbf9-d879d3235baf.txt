Vertebral Artery Ectasia in Marfan's Syndrome
Ectatic vertebral artery
Vertebral artery aneurysm
49 year old female with Marfan's Syndrome complains of "swooshing" sound in left ear.  MRA examination suggested and aneurysm of the left vertebral artery.  The patient does not have any other known vascular abnormalities.
Ectatic vessels, like the one presented in this case, can be seen in other connective tissue disorders (i.e. Ehlers Danlos) as well.
