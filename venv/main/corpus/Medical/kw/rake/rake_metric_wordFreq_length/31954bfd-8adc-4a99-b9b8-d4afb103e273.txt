Mild palpable swelling left popliteal fossa, with subtle palpable bruit.
Endovacular therapy was contemplated for the popliteal lesions, possibly in combination with surgical bypass. The other lesions were not considered as much in need of prompt treatment and follow-up evaluation was planned.
Multiple aneurysmic arterial dilatations, affecting the left popliteal (also right, not shown), the iliacs (common and internal), the aorta, and the left renal artery.
Popliteal Aneurysm
A number of causes may be considered, but the most common is atherosclerosis.
54 yom noticed swelling in his left popliteal fossa and presented to the emrgency department, where DVT was suspected and patient was sent for ultrasound. No DVT was found but bilateral L>R popliteal aneurysms were noted. Patient sent to IR for furter evaluation.
