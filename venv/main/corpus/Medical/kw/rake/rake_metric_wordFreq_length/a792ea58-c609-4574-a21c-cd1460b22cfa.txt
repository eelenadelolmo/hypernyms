CSF studies positive for Multiple Sclerosis
Surgical removal of Third Ventricular Mass
• Non-enhancing Third Ventricular mass

• Secondary Obstructive Hydrocephalus

• Multiple supra- and infra-tentorial lesions and spinal cord lesions consistent with demyelinating plaques - some lesions enhance, consistent with active MS.
Neurocytoma 3rd ventricle, Multiple Sclerosis
• Oligodendroglioma
• Central Neurocytoma
• Ependymoma, Subependymoma
• ADEM
• Metastatic disease
35 year old woman presents to ER with bilateral lower extremity weakness and numbness.  Has recently been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis by neurologist.
Neurocytomas are typically seen in a lateral ventricular location, arising from the septum pellucidum.  Third ventricular tumors, like this one, are less frequent.  

The coincidental diagnosis of a primary brain neoplasm in patient with MS is also quite unusual.
