Texto: 
Limited range of motion in extension/flexion with severe pain on supination/pronation.
The patient was managed conservatively with early mobilization. Treatment options include:

For nondisplaced or minimally displaced fractures: early mobilization (active and passive range of motion) should be initiated for stable fractures that involve less than one-third of the articular surface. Fractures involving more than one-third of the articular surface (type II): treat with a splint for 1 to 2 weeks, followed by protected range of motion for 7 to 10 days. Moderately acute displaced fractures or those with fragments blocking range of motion at the elbow: treat with surgical repair (open reduction with internal fixation or excision of the radial head). Comminuted radial head fractures (type III): treat with excision of the radial head alone or excision with placement of a silicone radial head prosthesis. 
(Fixation of moderately displaced fractures is generally accomplished with the use of small-diameter screws).
Lateral and oblique X-rays of left arm demonstrate a comminuted, intra-articular radial head fracture. ior Anterior and posterior fat pad elevation is noted on the lateral image suggesting a joint effusion.
Radial Head Fracture

22 y/o male with left elbow pain status post fall.
