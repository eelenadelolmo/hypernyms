shunt replacement, exahastive search for other sources and appropriate antimicrobial therapy
Rads:
AP CXR demonstrates patchy alveolar infiltrates in bilateral lower lung zones. Representing  loculated pleural effusions 
Chest CT demonstrates bilateral effusions with R>L.  Multiple bilateral peripherally distributed nodular opacities with cavitations and feeding vessels leading to the peripheral lung lesions
Septic Pulmonary Emboli
C- Carcinoma - Squamous is most common 
A- Autoimmune - Wegener's granulomatosis, Rheumatoid nodules 
V- Vascular - Emboli (septic emboli or bland emboli) 
I- Infection - Lung abscess, Bacterial pneumonia, Fungal pneumonia, Tuberculosis, Pneumatocele 
T- Trauma - Pulmonary laceration 
Y- Young (congenital) - Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, Pulmonary sequestration, Bronchogenic cyst
49-year-old male with PMH significant for end stage renal disease s/p external arteriovenous shunt placement for home dialysis presents with complaint of 3 days of fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, cough and pleuritic chest pain.  Patient had similar signs and symptoms 1 year, was found to have MSSA bacteremia with septic pulmonary emboli. Following shunt replacement and antimicrobial therapy he demonstrated improvement. Denies tobacco, alcohol or illicit drug use.  No family history of pulmonary disease or cancer
Septic pulmonary embolism occur when an infected thrombus fragments and an emboli colonized with bacteria or fungi  lodges in the pulmonary arterial circulation. Common sources septic thrombi include vegetative endocarditis and septic thrombophlebitis.  Other less common sources include infected transvenous pacemakers, catheters, or shunts.  

Organisms most commonly associated with septic pulmonary embolism include, Staphylococcus aureus and group A Streptococcus.  However many patients, especially Intravenous drug abusers may harbor polymicrobial emboli, including anaerobic and gram-negative organisms. Blood cultures may be falsely negative, particularly early in the disease process.

Patients with septic pulmonary emboli have varied presentations depending upon the organism and the underlying disease.  A high level of clinical suspicion is necessary given most often only non specific signs and symptoms including fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, cough, dyspnea or pluritic chest pain are obvious.   

The classic plain film findings of septic pulmonary emboli include multiple pulmonary nodules of variable size with or without  cavitation, located predominantly in the periphery and bases. However, most radiographs reveal only ill-defined infiltrates and effusions. 

CT is the preferred imaging technique for septic pulmonary emboli.  The presence of cavitating nodules with associated feeding vessels in highly specific for septic pulmonary emboli.
