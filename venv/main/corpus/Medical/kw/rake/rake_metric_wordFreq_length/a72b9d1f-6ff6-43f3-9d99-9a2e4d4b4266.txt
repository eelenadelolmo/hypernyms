AP view of an esophogram demonstrates a convex impression on the right with a smaller convexity inferiorly on the left.

Lateral view of an esophogram demonstrates a posterior extrinsic impression on the esophagus.

Serial contrast enhanced axial images of the aortic arch demonstrates a dominant aortic arch with its respective subclavian artery and common carotid artery.  There is extrinsic compression on the posterolateral wall of the esophagus by the left aortic arch.
Double Aortic Arch
Right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian
Double aortic arch
36 year old white male with long standing history of reflux.  Most recently complaining of dysphagia.
Double aortic arch is malformation commonly recognized on plain radiographs as a right paratracheal mass with extrinsic impression on the trachea.  The differential based on the plain radiographs would suggest a right aortic arch with an aberrant left subclavian or a double aortic arch.  The double aortic arch most commonly presents with a dominant right arch that is superior and larger to a lesser left aortic arch.  Confirmation can be made with CT or MRI.

In this patient's case, his symptoms prompted his physician to order an Upper GI study for dysphagia.  Suggestion of the double aortic arch was suggested by the S-shaped configuration of the esophagus on the AP view.  A follow up CT scan verified the findings.
