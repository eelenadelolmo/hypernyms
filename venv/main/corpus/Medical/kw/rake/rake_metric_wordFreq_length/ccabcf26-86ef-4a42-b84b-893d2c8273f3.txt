Texto: 
On physical exam the patient had assymetric fullness of the right posterior oropharynx.
No treatment is necessary beyond notification of the ordering physician so as to avoid any attempted biopsy and for pre-operative planning if intervention in the region is required for some other reason.
Contrast enhanced axial CT images of the neck demonstrate a marked tortuosity of the right internal carotid artery just distal to the carotid bulb.  There is medial deviation of the internal carotid with mass effect on the adjacent retropharyngeal soft tissues of the neck.  This correlates with the patient's "mass" alluded to in the clinical history.  Incidentally noted are calcified atherosclerotic plaques.

A thick section multi-planar reformatted image demonstrates the tortuosity of this vessel well.

Also in the patient's prior studies was a carotid dopler ultrasound examination which again demonstrated the tortuosity of this vessel.
medial deviation of internal carotid artery
Medial deviation of the internal carotid artery (aka retropharyngeal internal carotid)
84 year old male referred to otolaryngology clinic for a right tonsillar "mass."
The referring physician was contacted by telephone at the time of intrepretation of the examination.
