15 year old boy with a two week history of severe headache.

Family history of "heart aneurysms."
These aneurysms are unusual in location and shape.  The presence of two aneurysms arising from the same parent artery in such a young person, and with a family history of aneurysms brings up the question of a possible inherited disorder of blood vessels or collagen vasculopathy.
