ABDOMEN: Soft, non-tender
Surgical removal of the cyst.
Expansile process involving left maxillary bone extending into left maxillary sinus with erosion of the maxillary bone and associated left maxillary teeth roots.  There appears to be a sclerotic limb extending into the left maxillary sinus, and a tooth is noted to be suspended within the expansile lesion.  There is bilateral maxillary sinus inflammatory disease with the left maxillary sinus completely occluded with the sinus inflammatory process and left maxillary process which appears to be of odontogenic origin.  There are foci of gas noted within the left maxillary expansile cystic lesion.
Odontogenic Keratocyst
* Sinus disease
* Infection
* Mucocele
* Benign odontogenic cyst
* Dentigerous Cyst
