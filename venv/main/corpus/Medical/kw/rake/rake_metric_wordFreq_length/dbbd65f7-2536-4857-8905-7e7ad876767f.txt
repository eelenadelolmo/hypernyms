VS: BP-140/90     HR-103     RR-22   SpO2-94%     Tc-98.7F   Gen- middle aged obese male, in mild distress;  Cardiac- tachycardic, no appreciable m/r/g;  Pulm- tachypnic, slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally with bibasilar coarse breath sounds; Abd- non-distended, mild TTP LLQ, NABS; Extr- (+) LLE mild edema with thigh pain, pulses intact throughout
The pt had supplemental oxygen and 2 large bore IVs started.  He was admitted to the hospital and started on anticoagulation with heparin.  Even though the clots were rather large, t-PA was not started secondary to the patient being hemodynamically stable after initial resuscitation and without any signs of right heart strain.  Due to the pt’s history of the LLE DVT and the current bilateral PEs, in spite of therapeutic coumadin levels, a Greenfield filter was placed in the IVC.
CXR- bilateral small pleural effusions,no Westermark’s sign or Hampton’s hump.  There may be slight evidence of acute PAH with enlarged PA's on lateral view.

Spiral Chest CT demonstrating bilateral filling defects found in the right and left pulmonary arteries.

US of L common femoral vein and artery show decreased compressibility of vein with highly diminished blood flow.
Pulmonary Embolism
Pulmonary Embolism
Old PE with other pulmonary or cardiac etiologies of the patient’s pain:     MI, Pericarditis, Esophageal rupture, Pneumonia, Pneumothorax, Asthma, COPD
However, these other possibilities on the differential were not supported by ECG, CT, or the patient’s clinical presentation/history
42 y/o AAM with hx/of LLE DVT, presents to ER with acute shortness of breath and chest pain
