Examination: Back: 5 cm firm, indurated erythematous tumor with 2 cm area of central necrosis.
Labs: CT from December 2002 reveals increasing right-sided apical lung tumor with apical collapse and scar formation with worsening right-sided pleural effusion, as well as osseous lesions in the T5 and L1 vertebrae and pelvis.

Histopathology: The biopsy shows a carcinoma with cytomorphologic features consistent with the patient's prior bronchoalveolar carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry was strongly positive for TTF-1 and CK7 but negative for CK20; findings compatible with lung carcinoma.
Case 6, (27th Annual Uniformed Services Dermatology Conference, 2003) METASTATIC LUNG ADENOCARCINOMA
â€¢ other neoplasms
â€¢ infections
History: A 70 year old Caucasian male with non-small cell bronchoalveolar carcinoma since May 2000 presented with a necrotic nodule on his back. His cancer was initially responsive to chemotherapy but became chemoresistant and was discontinued two weeks prior to his presentation to Dermatology.
