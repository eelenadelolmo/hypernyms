Not applicable
None needed unless the patient becomes symptomatic and develops complications such as abscess or malignancy within the diverticulum.
Computed tomography of the chest demonstrates a cystic lesion that is just left and lateral to the esophagus.  It contains air and debri.  The walls of the lesion are not thickened.  The lesion also has a slightly anterior position with respect to the esophagus.

The modified barium swallow study shows a left lateral diverticulum that filled and emptied with swallowing.  The diverticulum has a narrow neck.  Lateral projections confirmed its anterior position to the esophagus.  No mucosal irregularity was noted within the diverticulum.
Killian-Jamieson Diverticulum
Zenker’s diverticulum
Traction diverticulum
Epiphrenic diverticulum
Intramural esophageal pseudodiverticulosis
Intraluminal diverticulum
The patient presented with fever and abdominal pain.  A Chest CT was performed which revealed a cystic lesion near the lower esophagus filled with debris and demonstrating air fluid levels.  This was an incidental finding unrelated to the patient’s fever and abdominal pain.  The patient denied any dysphagia or symptoms of regurgitation.
This is case represents a classic Killian-Jamieson diverticulum because is projects lateral to the cervical spine and anterior to the esophagus.  Like the patient in this case, most individuals are asymptomatic; however, some may complain of dysphagia, regurgitation, or halitosis.

This patient has a Killian-Jamieson Diverticulum rather than a pouch.  Individuals with pouches demonstrate lesions that fill late during swallowing and empty after swallowing.  This patient’s lesion did not empty quickly as seen with the persistence of contrast within the cystic protrusion.

A Killian-Jamieson diverticulum is different from a Zenker’s Diverticulum in that a Zenker’s Diverticulum lies in the midline of the posterior wall of the esophagus and extends inferiorly behind the cervical esophagus.  A Zenker’s Diverticulum is also more superior and lies above the pharyngoesophageal junction while a Killian-Jamieson’s Diverticulum forms just below the cricopharyngeal muscle.  A Zenker’s Diverticulum forms in Killian’s dehiscence which has been described in two ways.  It has been described as the space between the thyropharyngeal and cricopharyngeal muscles as well as the space between the horizontal and oblique muscles of the cricopharyngeal muscle.
