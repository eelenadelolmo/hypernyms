Transverse gray-scale view of the lower pole of the right kidney demonstrates a small bright echogenic focus with possible shadowing suggestive of a nonobstructing renal stone.  Color Doppler imaging shows a “twinkle” artifact confirming this echogenic focus is a renal calculi.

Unenhanced axial CT from the same patient obtained a few months later, demonstrates the non-obstructing renal calculi in the lower pole of the right kidney.
Nephrolithiasis with "twinkle" artifact on color Dopler ultrasound
• Nephrolithiasis
• Intrarenal gas
• Renal artery calcification
• Calcified sloughed papilla
• Calcified transitional cell tumor
59 yo woman referred for renal ultrasound.
Using color Doppler imaging, the twinkle artifact, which appears as a colored ring-down artifact behind a strong acoustic interface, is able to help identify small non-shadowing calculi.  When sound reflects off the acoustic interface and returns to the transducer, the returning pulse may be robust enough that the energy is reflected off the transducer and directed back into the body so that the pulse can interact with the same near field interface a second time, or even multiple times, producing an additional set of echoes that are registered as arising deep to the original reflector.  By placing the focal zone at or slightly below the area of interest, one is able to identify this characteristic rapidly fluctuating mixture of Doppler signals.  

In this particular case, the demonstration of the twinkle artifact is helpful because the non-obstructing renal calculi was diagnosed, sparing the patient further diagnostic tests or interventions. 

A few months later, the same patient underwent a abdominal CT which confirmed the presence of renal calculi.
