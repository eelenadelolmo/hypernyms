13 year old girl presents with seizures and headache.
PMHx: She was treated at age three for leukemia, including cranial and spinal radiation therapy.
This  glioblastoma is likely one that is a radiation induced, second primary tumor -  since the diagnosis of GBM in a 13 year old is very unusual.

There is some artifact generated by the patient's braces.  Her mother declined to remove them prior to scanning.
