Axial black blood double inversion recovery fast spin echo and cine GRE MR images of the heart demonstrate interruption of the interatrial septum with communication of the right atrium and left atrium.  On cine GRE, there is also note of a "flow jet" (fan shaped signal void) eminating from the mitral valve into the left atrium consistent with mitral regurgitation.  The pulmonary venous return (not shown) was normal.
Atrial Septal Defect
Mitral regurgitation
(by imaging)
Diagnoses: 
1.	Sinus venosus atrial septal defect
2.	Mitral regurgitation
An 88-year-old man with coronary artery disease.   At cardiac catheterization, he was found to have a “bulbous superior vena cava” and decreased oxygen tension in the right atrium.
Atrial septal defects (ASDs) commonly are undiagnosed until adulthood because of their relatively benign course.  All are characterized by left to right shunts, causing volume overload of the right atrium, right ventricle and pulmonary arteries.  Pulmonary hypertension is present by adulthood in 40% of patients.  In addition, mitral regurgitation is found in 20% of patients over 50 years of age.
	Echocardiography remains the imaging modality of choice in ASDs, but MR can be helpful in difficult cases.  The interatrial septum is best imaged in the axial and horizontal long-axis planes.  The normal septum is quite thin in the area of the ostuim secundum.  As a result, apparent discontinuity of the septum at that point should be confirmed on two contiguous imaging planes, and secondary signs of left to right shunt should be present.   These include enlargement of the right atrium, right ventricle and pulmonary arteries and associated clockwise rotation of the heart, so that the heart lies predominantly in the left hemithorax.    
	Sinus venosus ASDs are the least common type, characterized by a communication between the right atrium at the junction with the posterior/inferior superior vena cava and the left atrium at a point just inferior to the confluence of the right upper lobe pulmonary vein and left atrium.  There is a high association with partial anomalous pulmonary venous return; the anomalous pulmonary vein frequently inserts into the svc or right atrium.
