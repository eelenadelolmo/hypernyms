57yo F with 1 mo cough presents for f/u CXR. CXR 1 mo ago showed interstitial infiltrates and was prescribed abx.  PMH includes colon cancer â€“ dx 5y ago as stage 2 with hepatic metastases.
15-20% of colon cancer patients have distant metastases at time of presentation. Spread is via lymphatic or hematogenous dissemination, or continguous spread. Liver is the frequent site of metastases, as the portal vein is the primary drainage for the intestinal tract; other common sites of metastases include lungs, lymph nodes, peritoneum; more rare sites include brain and bone.  5yr survival 50-75% dependent upon stage at presentation.
