No findings of shoulder instability on physical exam.
Surgical repair of the torn superior labrum.
T1-weighted axial and coronal images with fat-saturation of the shoulder following intra-articular administration of gadolinium. The coronal image demonstrates an irregular collection of contrast extending into the normally dark triangular appearing superior labrum. Axial image demonstrates an irregular collection of contrast between the frayed appearing posterior superior labrum and the posterior glenoid. The Biceps anchor appears normal.
SLAP Lesion of the Glenoid Labrum
SLAP lesion
Sublabral foramen
Sublabral recess
Soft-ball player who complains of several months of right shoulder pain, aggravated by throwing the ball. No history of an acute injury.
The administration of intra-articular gadolinium can be helpful in clearly demonstrating a SLAP lesion on MR imaging. On the coronal images, the superior labrum normally appears as a black triangle extending off of the superior glenoid. Any signal extending into the substance of the triangle is abnormal and represents a SLAP lesion. This can be differentiated from the normal variant sublabral recess, because in a sublabral recess the contrast collection appears smooth and tapering and extends toward the base of the triangle, rather than into the substance of the triangle, as in this SLAP lesion. A sublaral foramen can be differentiated from a SLAP lesion, because a sublabral foramen occurs in the anterior quadrant rather than posterior quadrant and as in the sublabral recess, the contrast collection is smooth and tapering in appearance rather than irregular as demonstrated in this SLAP tear.
When describing a SLAP lesion, it is important to describe the extent of the lesion from front to back, as well as to describe whether there is involvement of the biceps anchor. When using direct MR arthrography, the biceps anchor is usually best evaluated on the axial and sagittal images.
