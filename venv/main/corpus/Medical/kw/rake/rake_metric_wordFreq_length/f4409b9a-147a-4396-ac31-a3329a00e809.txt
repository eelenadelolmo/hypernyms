Tachycardia and tachypnea.
The patient is being treated with antibiotics with recommendation to have follow up imaging in 4-6 weeks to evaluate for resolution.  Although not all pediatric cases require follow up imaging, this was requested to rule out a structural abnormality.
There is a 4 cm rounded density seen within the right upper lobe with a suggestion of air-bronchogram along the inferior aspect.
Pediatric pneumonia (Round pneumonia)
CCAM
Sequestration
Previously healthy female presents with 2 days of fever to 104F.
This is a previously healthy child with no prior imaging.  Although it is not unheard of for a child with CCAM or sequestration to go this long without diagnosis, it does make it less likely.  The clinical presentation of fevers is typical for pneumonia.  The follow up imaging should show resolution.  If there is a persistent density then a CT may be indicated.
