A hemothorax is defined as a bloody pleural effusion with a hematocrit exceeding half the value in peripheral blood.  It can be seen after trauma, pulmonary embolism, as a result of metastatic disease, after anticoagulant therapy, or as a sequel of a leaking aortic aneurysm.  Hemothorax is a potential surgical complication of posterior spinal surgery and  may be caused by iatrogenic rupture of  blood vessel with subsequent hemorrhage into the thoracic pleural space.   CT scanning of a hemothorax shows an effusion with relatively high attenuation, exceeding 35 Hounsfield units (HU) when the blood is fresh, and reaching 70 HU with clotted blood.  Spontaneous hemopneumothorax has been reported widely, though a rare occurrence, and can result in a massive fluid accumulation in the pleural space if there is lung collapse and lack of tamponade of the bleeding vessel.   Therapeutic methods include tube thoracostomy, open thoracostomy and VATS (video assisted thoracoscopic surgery).
