Pale, Right upper quadrant tenderness to palpation 2/5, Hypochromic microcytic anemia
This patient was enrolled in the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center P6 protocol for DSRCT that was the standard of therapy at that time. This protocol involved seven rounds of combination chemotherapy with surgery occurring after the third round of treatment and then an autologous stem cell transplant at the end of the treatment cycle. This patient also received aggressive post-surgical radiation therapy of 3,000 cGy. 
   The patient initially tolerated the therapy well, but was found to have tumor recurrence within a year of ending the protocol. The subsequent treatment course encountered multiple complications that lead to urosepsis and eventually the death of the patient 2 years and 11 months after the initial diagnosis.
Abdominal Ultrasound – Hepatosplenomegaly, and 2 hypoechoic homogenous pelvic masses with greatest diameters at 6cm and 4cm. 

CT Abdomen and Pelvis – Multiple soft tissue masses with the largest in the region of the tail of the pancreas encasing the celiac axis, the superior mesenteric artery, and the renal and splenic vessels. Several lesions in the right lobe of the liver and one lesion in the left lobe of the liver.
Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor
Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor (DSRCT); Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor (PNET); Undifferentiated Sarcoma; Lymphoma; Infection (i.e. Mycobacterium-avium Intracellulare)
15 year old previously healthy male presents with two weeks of fatigue and weakness, anemia requiring transfusions, and splenomegaly.
