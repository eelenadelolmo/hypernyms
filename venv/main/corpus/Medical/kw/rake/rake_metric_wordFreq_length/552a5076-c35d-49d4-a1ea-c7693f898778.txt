Texto: 
The patient had normal vital signs.  Auscultation of the lungs revealed bilateral rhonchi.  Examination of the heart revealed a regular rhythm, normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The remainder of the physical exam was unremarkable.  Electrocardiogram, complete blood count, electrolytes, creatine kinase, troponin, and coagulation studies were all within normal limits.
The patient was weened off the three liters of oxygen to room air and observed for 3 hours.  The patient continued to have an oxygen saturation of 100 percent with resolved shortness of breath and hemoptysis.  The patient was put on light duty with no swimming for 3 days and allowed to resume training as tolerated thereafter.
Venous congestion with partial reolution on follow-up chest film done 3 hours later.
Swimming-Induced Pulmonary Edema (SIPE)
<li>pulmonary edema
<li>aspiration pneumonia
<li>fresh water drowning
<li>fluid overload
A healthy twenty year old United States Navy search and rescue swimmer, equipped with only mask and fins performed a breath-hold dive to twelve feet.  He developed sharp substernal chest pain, and shortness of breath.  He immediately surfaced and began to cough up pink, frothy sputum and have persistent shortness of breath.

His initial oxygen saturation was 70 percent on room air and improved to 86 percent on three liters of oxygen via nasal cannula during ambulance transfer.  
Upon arrival to the emergency room the patient had an oxygen saturation of 100 percent on three liters of oxygen with improved shortness of breath and resolved hemoptysis.  The patient denied aspiration.  The patient also denied any history of asthma, dyspnea on exertion, or similar episodes.
