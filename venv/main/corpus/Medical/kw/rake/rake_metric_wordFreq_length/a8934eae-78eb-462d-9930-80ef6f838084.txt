Appendicitis is a common pediatric emergency with a prevalence ranging from 1% to 4%.  A delayed diagnosis may lead to serious complications such as perforation, abscess, peritonitis, and bowel obstruction.  Usually CT is the test of choice in diagnosing appendicitis because it has a higher sensitivity than US (95% versus 78%) and has the capability of determining the extent of disease in a perforated appendix.  However, US is advantageous because it is low cost, easily accessible and lacks ionizing radiation.  A fluid-filled, noncompressible, blind-ending tubular structure that is greater than 6mm in diameter are the most specific findings of appendicitis on US.  An appendicolith, which is echogenic appearing with acoustic shadowing may also be seen.   Additionally, periappendiceal fluid and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes are sometimes seen.  Finally, the transverse view may give a target-like appearance due to the fluid-filled lumen surrounded by echogenic mucosa and submucosa with a hypoechoic muscularis layer.
