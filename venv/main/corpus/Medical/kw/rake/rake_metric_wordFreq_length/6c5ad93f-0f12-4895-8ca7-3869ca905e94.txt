Texto: 
The patient had an essentially normal physical exam, except for minor neurological deficits. The patient demonstrated minor loss of motor and sensory function in the right arm, and a slight widening of gait on turning. 
CSF analysis conducted after the MRI imaging demonstrated no malignant cells, 4 WBC, 2 RBC, protein 41, glucose 72, negative oligo-clonalbands, normal IgG levels. Blood labs showed negative ANA, ESR 0, lyme negative, and SPEP normal.
The CSF analysis was not consistent with an infection, and therefore the patient was treated with steroids and the symptoms improved. The lesions shows good response to steroids radiographically as well as clinically.
Bilateral pontine lesions with left more than right. The lesion is shown to have hyperintensity on T2 and Flair, although minimal on T1.
Grading Gliomas using rCBV Perfusion Imaging
>> Low grade Glioma
>> demyelination
>> infection
>> ischemic infarcts
Patient is a 60 yo RHD male that presented with a 4 wk history of subacute onset disequilibrium. His neurological complaints were significant for loss of balance especially in the dark and in turning, as well as diplopia on lateral gaze bilaterally. The patient also complained of mild numbness in right lateral forearm and hand.
A diffuse pontine lesion that shows hyperintensity on T2 and Flair is suspicious for a mass as well as demyelination. The extensive CSF analysis and the lack of stereotypical localization of the lesions makes demyelination less likely. The MR Spectroscopy was instrumental in differentiating the lesion between a tumor versus an infection, the former having the elevatred choline level as was the case here, and the latter having the elevation in lactate. 
With the presumptive diagnosis of tumor, the grading of the tumor comes to play, and the DWI proves to be instrumental in demonstrating the lack of extensive neo-vascularization as would be expected of a high grade tumor.
