Patient is a well developed, well nourished. Bilateral optic nerve head edema noted. Normal visual acuity, EOMI, PERRLA, and all other cranial nerves showed no abnormality.
Also noted on MRI was occipital bone marrow replacement and enhancement on undersurface along with lymphadenopathy on CT making diagnosis of lymphoma likely. Biopsy of axial lymph nodes and extraconal mass showed presence of B cell SLL/CLL and WBC was 47 with differential consistent with this diagnosis.

Due to slow growth and lack of symptoms at this time, the patient may elect to not pursue treatment at this time.  Radiation therapy could be given to orbits to prevent visual problems from continued growth of masses. It would be given to the complete orbits at dose of 20-25 Gy in 2 Gy fractions. This will invariably lead to cataracts, but retinal damage and xerophthalmia would be unlikely at this dose. Chemotherapy can also be considered for systemic treatment.
MRI: Extraconal mass along the roof of the left orbit, 8mm CC x 3.8cm AP x 3.4cm transverse, indistinct from lacrimal gland. Right lacrimal gland also enlarged or surrounded by mass.
B-cell Lymphoma
Metastatic tumors (carcinomas of lung, prostate, GI, renal, skin, (breast in female)); lacrimal gland lesions (infiltrative processes and epithelial neoplasms); mesenchymal tumors (fibroma, fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, fibrous histiocytoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma (most common orbit tumor in children)); neurogenic tumors (neurofibroma, Schwannoma, and gliomas and meningiomas of the optic nerve); inflammations; structural lesions (dermoid cysts and mucoceles); vascular neoplastic lesions; lymphoproliferative lesions.
The patient was diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri 3 yrs ago and presented for follow up with opthalmology with no complaints or specific symptoms. He did report a 10 lb weight loss over past 18 mos.
