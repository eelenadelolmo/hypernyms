PHYSICAL EXAM:	large bilateral pretibial deep ulcerations and scattered erythematous indurated nodules and plaques on the anterior thighs.

LABORATORY: CBC: WBC 8.7, Hgb 14.3, Hct 43.1, Platelets 348, differential 66% neutrophils, 21% lymphocytes, 10% monocytes. Electrolytes: WNL. Albumin 4.2, alk phos 104, AST 24, LDH 230, T.bili 5, ALT 33
The patient underwent colonoscopy which revealed scattered mucosal ulcerations of the descending and ascending colon, and rectal disease with ulcerations and pseudopolyps. He was treated with prednisone 80mg qd and Asachol for his Crohn disease. With local wound care, his leg ulcerations granulated and healed over 3 months.

Cutaneous Chron Disease
The 33 y.o. man presented initially with bilateral lower extremity pretibial papules. They	became dusky, painful and progressively enlarged and ulcerated over a 3 month period. He was treated with a two week course of steroids, Keflex, and itraconazole all without response.
HISTOPATHOLOGY:  Non-caseating granulomas with lymphohistiocytic cells and numerous multinucleated giant cells. Confluence of granulomas. Foci of necrosis with numerous neutrophils and occasional granulomas with many eosinophils. GMS and PAS stains were negative, as were AFB and Fite stains.
