Patient was given thiamine, but expired
• T2 hyperintensity within the both thalami
• T2 hyperintensity of the periaqueductal grey matter
• Enhancement of both mamillary bodies
• Enhancement of the periaqueductal grey matter
Wernicke encephalopathy
• bilateral thalamic glioma
• metabolic/toxic processes (Wernicke encephalopathy, Leigh disease, Wilson disease)
• infectious agents (Japanese and West Nile encephalitis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease)
• vascular lesions(deep venous thrombosis, top of the basilar syndrome, infarction of the artery of Percheron)
52 year old woman with a history of breast cancer, on chemotherapy.  Poor oral intake and now stuporous.
Limited differential diagnosis - MR imaging is the modality of choice Differential diagnosis can be narrowed by the imaging appearance in combination with the presence or absence of other regions of involvement, & the patient’s history. The differential includes primary neoplastic processes (bilateral thalamic glioma), metabolic/toxic processes (Wernicke encephalopathy, Leigh disease, Wilson disease), infectious agents (Japanese and West Nile encephalitis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), & vascular lesions(deep venous thrombosis, top of the basilar syndrome, infarction of the artery of Percheron)
