Follow up with Maternal - Fetal specialist in OB-GYN clinic same day.
Initial intracranial images demonstrate markedly dilated lateral ventricles.  

Profile images show a midline nasofrontal mass in the region of the glabella.
Fronto-nasal encephalocele
Nasofronal encephalocele (Sincipital)
Dermoid / Epidermoid cyst
Nasal glioma
22 year old woman for third trimester OB visit, follow up US for a fetus who is small for dates.
At our institution, the radiologist on service will speak with the mother about the result of the exam before she departs for the clinic.  In this case, the Maternal - Fetal specialists were contacted and the OB- GYN physician requested to see the patient immediately.  After this was arranged, the radiologist proceeded to discuss with the patient the importance of the abnormal findings.  Most patients have never heard of encephalocele so it is important to say "abnormal" or "needs immediate attention".  The patient was escorted to the Maternal Fetal specialist.  

No feedback at this time as to the fate of the pregnancy or the mother&#39;s opinion about the findings.

This patients previous 20 week OB, anatomic screening US, did not include a nose / lip image or a profile image.  Sometimes fetal images are difficult to obtain.  It is important to document not only what is seen but what is not seen as well.  The teaching point is to always have a checklist, whether mental or on paper.
