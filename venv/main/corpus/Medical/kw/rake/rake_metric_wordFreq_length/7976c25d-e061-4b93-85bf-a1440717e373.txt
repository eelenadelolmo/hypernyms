Unremarkable.
Pre-op PFTs and cardiac exam cleared for surgery.
Right thoracotomy, right upper lobe pulmonary wedge resection with peri-operative frozen section diagnosis of adenocarcinoma
During operation, unable to 1 lung ventilate.  Decision was made not to undergo right upper lobectomy.
1cm x 1cm solitary spiculated nodule, active on PET scan.
Adenocarcinoma of the Lung
Malignant: 
- Bronchogenic carcinoma - Small cell, large cell, adenocarcinoma, and squamous 
- Carcinoids

- Vascular lesions - Arteriovenous malformation 
- Infectious granulomas - Tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial infection, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and blastomycosis 
- Noninfectious granulomas - Rheumatoid arthritis, Wegener granulomatosis, and sarcoidosis 
- Developmental lesions - Bronchogenic cyst

Solitary pulmonary nodule

-A single discrete pulmonary opacity that is surrounded by normal lung tissue and is not associated with adenopathy or atelectasis.

-Radiographically, a nodule is defined as a lesion smaller than 3 cm. Anything larger than 3 cm is termed a mass.

-SPNs are fairly common. Screening studies in adults reveal SPNs in 1-2 per 1000 chest radiographs. In the United States, an estimated 150,000 SPNs are detected annually.
