Blood pressure 124/palp, heart rate is 88. Respirations are assisted by ventilator. Saturation 100%. General appearance: He is unconsciousness. GCS is 3. Multiple complex facial fractures and lacerations with complete loss of architecture along his nasal bone, nasal bridge, and mala area. Significant eye trauma and possible partial enucleation of the left eye. Cornea cloudy on the right. Torn iris on his right eye. Oropharynx has blood. Face is completely unstable. Neck: C-collar in place. Chest: He has a right chest tube. Breath sounds are present. No breath sounds on the left. Abdomen is soft. Neuro: GCS is 3.
After initial stabilization and critical care of this patient and his many injuries consultations were made with both ENT, Ophthalmology, and Plastic surgery to futher evaluate and make plans for extensive reconstructive surgery.  A tracheostomy was performed to secure an airway.
The frontal sinus is filled with fluid, except for a small air bubble on the right. Just above the orbits, the frontal sinus is shattered, both the anterior and posterior walls, and the septum between the lateral sinuses. Extensively comminuted fractures extend down through the ethmoid cells and orbital roofs and extensive involve the medial walls of the orbits. The zygomatic arches show comminuted fractures and lateral orbital rims are spread and displaced posteriorly. Comminuted fractures extend down through the lateral orbital wall into the floor of the orbits. The sphenoid bone shows minor fracturing. The maxillary bones and sinuses are shattered and compress posteriorly. Nasal bones are fractured and largely absent. The middle fossa is largely spared. Comminuted fractures extend down through the maxilla and pterygoid plate. The maxilla is fractured in the left parasymphyseal region and in the region of the coronoid processes. The left ramus fracture is actually comminuted with a large central fragment. 

Impression: EXTREMELY COMMINUTED AND DISPLACED FRACTURES OF ALL OF THE FACIAL BONES, INCLUDING ALL MARGINS OF THE ORBITS AND ALL THE PARANASAL SINUSES.
Facial trauma s/p MVA
None
59 y/o male involved in a high speed motor vehicle crash in which he was ejected from his car and sustained extensive trauma.
