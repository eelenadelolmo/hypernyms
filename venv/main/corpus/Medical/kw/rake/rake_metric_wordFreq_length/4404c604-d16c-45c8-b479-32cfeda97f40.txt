The patient is 6’ tall and weighs 236 lbs.  Blood pressure taken on the left arm in the seated position was 106/66mmHg.  

Active range of motion of the cervical spine revealed flexion to be accomplished to 45o/50o, right rotation to 45o/80o, left rotation to 45o/80o, left lateral bending to 20o/45o, right lateral bending to 20o/45o and extension to 20o/60o.  He reported cervicothoracic pain with all movements of the neck.  He reported cervicothoracic pain that radiated down into his upper thoracic region with extension.  

DMX evaluation can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4xTad5tVzw&feature=youtu.be

The bicep and tricep reflexes were graded 2/4 bilaterally.  Active range of motion of the shoulders revealed elevation of each to be accomplished to 150o.  Muscle strengths of the upper extremities revealed a weakness of the right flexor carpi ulnaris, flexors profundus and superficialis with regard to the 5th digit of the right hand likely due to pain.  Cervical distraction was unremarkable.  Cervical compression testing produced report of neck pain extending to the right shoulder.  Grip strength was tested using a Jamar dynamometer.  The right hand tested to 50 lbs and the left hand tested to 85 lbs.  He reports being right hand dominant.   

Postural evaluation revealed a low left shoulder.  Active range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine revealed flexion to be performed to 30o/90o with report of lower back pain extending to the buttock bilaterally.  Left and right lateral bending was accomplished on either side to 10o/25o with report of lower back pain. Extension was accomplished to 10o/25o with report of lower back pain.  The subpatellar and Achilles reflexes were graded 2/4 bilaterally.  He was able to toe walk and heel walk without a problem.  He was able to squat with report of lower back pain.  The straight leg raise on the left side could be performed to 40o with report of lower back and left lower extremity pain extending to the foot.  The right straight leg raise could be performed to 35o with report of lower back and right lower extremity pain extending to the calf.  Muscle strengths of the flexor and extensor halluces revealed a weakness in the left extensor hallucis graded 4/5.  Percussion and posterior to anterior compression of the spine produced report of pain over the cervicothoracic and lumbosacral regions.  Hypomobility was noted at the cervicothoracic and lumbosacral regions. Muscle spasm was noted over the cervicothoracic and lumbosacral regions paraspinally. Pain/tenderness, asymmetry/misalignment, abnormal range of motion, and tissue/tone changes were associated with the areas of hypomobility.
CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT -  The use of treatment mnemonically termed "ICE", representing ice, compression, and elevation, is considered to be standard procedure (1).  The objective of conservative management procedures is to prevent development of MO and such is facilitated by immobilization.  Active range of motion exercises to tolerance may begin 2-4 weeks following injury. Interferential therapy used submotor in the treatment of the pain associated with the haematoma is considered to be helpful.  It is the opinion of the contributor (GG) that the use of ultrasound and diathermy does not serve to resorb the mass, but rather, serves to complete the ossification process and assist in maturation of the disorder.  The use of hyaluronidase, corticosteroids, proteolytic enzymes, and radiotherapy are not felt to be of particular benefit in promoting absorption of MO.  

     ALLOPATHIC AND OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT (1)- Occasionally, the haematoma will become infected, whereupon, antibiotic therapy is utilized.  Operative intervention may be considered when the following is present (4):  The lesion is so large that its mere size may result in further damage to the soft tissues in the region;  the lesion has a spiculated or sharp point to it that is likely to result in further hemorrhage;  or the lesion is sufficiently large so as to result in restriction of joint movement.  Excision of the MO after maturity of the lesion (5-6 months) is generally the technique of choice.  
In this case, Estim to the cervicothoracic region and chiropractic manipulative therapy were used.

CT 18 MONTHS POST - MVA:
THERE IS CALCIFICATION WITHIN THE POSTERIOR SOFT TISSUE TO THE LEFT OF MIDLINE.  THIS IS WITHIN THE LEFT PARASPINOUS MUSCLES AT THE C3 LEVEL.  ON THE SAGITTAL IMAGE IT EXTENDS VERTICALLY OVER A LENGTH OF 13MM AND ON THE AXIAL IMAGING IS 6MM IN THICKNESS.   THIS IS WELL CORTICATED.  IT DOES NOT REPRESENT AN ACUTE FRACTURE FRAGMENT.  AN OLD FRACTURE IS POSSIBLE. HOWEVER, NO DONOR SITE OF THIS SIZE CAN BE IDENTIFIED.  IT COULD REPRESENT A CONGENITAL NON UNITED PORTION OF THE SPINOUS PROCESS.  HOWEVER, THE SIZE DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO THE REMAINDER OF THE SPINOUS PROCESS.  THE MOST LIKELY POSSIBILITY WOULD BE MYOSITIS OSSIFICANS WITHIN THE LEFT PARASPINOUS MUSCLE AFTER TRAUMA.  THE MUSCLE IS SIGNIFICANTLY ATROPHIC IN THIS AREA SUGGESTING AN OLD MUSCLE TEAR

19 y/o male involved in motor vehicle accident 18 months prior to CT images taken. 

He reports that around the time period of the accident he was involved in an  occupation of detailing cars.  The patient reports that he was the driver of a moving vehicle with his seat belt attached.  He reports that the vehicle he was in was struck by another vehicle on the driver’s side and front causing the vehicle he was in to be pushed into a gas station.  He reports that the vehicle he was in was equipped with airbags and such deployed.  He reports that the vehicle he was in was “totaled”.  He reports that he impacted the air bag and had a loss of consciousness.  He reports regaining consciousness in the gas station area into which the vehicle he was in was pushed.  He reports no blood loss.  

He reports that an ambulance was summoned and he was taken to St. Joseph’s Hospital where he was examined, radiographs performed, medications prescribed and he was released.  He reports that he went back the following week and the ER looked at his right wrist but did not even look at his neck or back.

Patient reports prior to the MVA he had no health issues.  Patient reported after MVA, he started having cervical pain (8.5/10) extending down to the mid back region and radiating to upper extremities bilaterally.  Patient also reported lower back pain (8/10) and right hand pain along the ulnar aspect.  
He reported no loss of bowel or bladder control and denied taking any medication at the time of examination

PMH - Patient denies work episodes, other vehicular accidents or slips, falls or athletic episodes where an injury was sustained.  He denies surgery, fractures, allergies, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease, shortness of breath, hearing loss, heart disease, cancer, gout, seizures, asthma, ulcers and thyroid disease.

Some 20 months later, the patient was asked again if he had any episodes of neck injury given the findings on the CT scan and DMX evaluations.  He recalls that he had some neck pain when playing football 9-10 years ago but such was not serious and he made a full recovery.

The CT of the cervical spine shows calcification within the posterior soft tissue to the left of the mid line.  It is clear that the calcification is within the left paraspinous muscles at the C3 level.  It is well corticated and does not represent an acute fracture fragment which would be seen in the case of Clay Shovler’s fracture.  There is also no identification of donor site of the fragment size seen and corresponding remainder of spinous process is not observed.  There is significant atrophy of the left paraspinous muscle which suggest an old muscle tear and given history of trauma, motor vehicle accident 18 months prior to the image, it is likely heterotopic/myositis ossification.  The location of ossification is unique for heterotopic ossification.  There has been a case report of non-traumatic heterotopic ossifcans in the lumbosacral paravertebral muscle, however the ossification is more wide spread, extending from L5 to S2.  At the time of writing, we could not find literature on myositis ossificans traumatica observed in cervical paravertebral muscle.  Even though occurrence of MO is rarity in cervical paravertebral muscle, diagnosis should be considered with history of trauma and imaging shows a mass consistent with ossification outside the bone.  

The interesting aspect from a diagnostic imaging perspective in this case is that MRI failed to clearly identify the myositis ossificans.  This is not unexpected since the heterotopic bone would not be expected to have hydrogen within it and to which MRI is most sensitive.  Additionally, it would appear that the vehicular accident was of sufficient traumatic effect to produce the necessary disruption to produce this disorder.
