Physical examination shows low-set ears, redundant skin, nasal flattening and a receding chin with micrognathia.
The patient succumbed to coexistent severe pulmonary hypoplasia (from severe oligohydramnios in utero).
Transverse and coronal grayscale sonographic images through the renal fossae show absence of identifiable reniform structures (i.e., kidneys). Note the elongated, flattened, cylindrical, discoid shapes of the adrenal glands, which simulate the appearance of kidneys in this patient with bilateral renal agenesis.  This is the normal sonographic appearance of the adrenal glands in infants.
Bilateral renal agenesis
*Bilateral renal agenesis
*Funtional cause of in utero renal failure (e.g., severe IUGR).
A 34 week premature Asian female infant presents on day of life zero with anuria and Potter's facies.
Please refer to the accompanying factoid.
