Non-enhanced axial CT image of the orbits demonstrates bilateral proptosis with enlargement of the medial rectus muscle bellies with sparing of the tendonous insertions.  Coronal reformatted images demonstrate symmetric bilateral enlargement of the inferior, medial, superior, and to a lesser extent, lateral retus muscles.  The retrobulbar fat and globes are unremarkable.
