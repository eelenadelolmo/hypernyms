Pain to palpation in right midfoot.  Prior plain films (not available) of the right foot were interpreted as normal.
This patient was informed of her diagnosis and told to avoid weightbearing.  At that time, she also admitted that her left foot and left tibia hurt as well.
Images of a Tc-99m MDP bone scan are provided.  Pool images show normal to slightly increased activity along the shafts of both 2nd metatarsals, right greater than left.  Delayed images show a marked area of increased activity in the right 2nd metatarsal head, with increased linear activity in both 2nd metatarsal shafts and in the left mid tibial diaphysis.
Occult Stress Fracture of right 2nd metatarsal head, with moderate to severe stress reactions in both 2nd metatarsal shafts and in the left mid tibial diaphysis.
Stress fracture
Stress reaction
Infection
22 year old female military recruit complains of right foot pain.  This had been ongoing for weeks.
The 2nd metatarsal shaft stress fracture is a classic "march" fracture.  As this patient was, indeed, a military recruit, she fits the classic profile.
