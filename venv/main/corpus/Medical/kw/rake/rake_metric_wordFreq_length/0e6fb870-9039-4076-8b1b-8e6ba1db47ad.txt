For nondisplaced, therefore inherently stable fractures, placement of a posterior cast can provide enough stability to control pain and allow healing. For those fractures not in anatomic alignment, i.e. that show varying degrees of displacement or angulation, closed or even open reduction with percutaneous pinning may be necessary. 
Complications of supracondylar fractures include nerve injury, vascular injury with compartment syndrome, as well as deformities due to malalignment and to contractures. Thus, close follow up is required.
There is an elbow joint effusion demonstrated by displaced anterior and posterior fat pads. 

There is a transverse supracondylar fracture of the distal humerus without displacement or angulation of the distal fragment.

A 5 year old boy presents to the emergency room with a painful, swollen left elbow. The patient’s mother states he fell onto an extended elbow.
From the above-mentioned fractures, supracondylar fracture is the most common fracture around the elbow in the pediatric age group. The usual mechanism of injury is a fall onto an extended elbow, an extension type injury which accounts for 90-95% of all supracondylar fractures, resulting in posterior displacement of the distal fragment. The less-common flexion mechanism of injury results in anterior displacement of the distal fragment.

Supracondylar fractures are classified into three groups.
Type I is a fracture in near anatomic alignment. Type III is completely displaced, and a type II fracture is displaced but with an intact cortical hinge. Twenty to thirty percent of all supracondylar fractures are type I and approximately twenty five percent of supracondylar fractures are greenstick in nature, type I or II. 

Children who present with nondisplaced supracondylar fractures may present with vague pain so that the differential diagnosis may include nursemaid's elbow, occult fractures of the radial head, condyle fractures, or a septic joint.

Prompt diagnosis and treatment of supracondylar injuries is important to improved clinical outcome. For this reason, orthopedic consultation is recommended for all supracondylar fractures, even if in near anatomic alignment. In particular, type III fractures require immediate orthopedic referral as the potential for nerve injuries and compartment syndrome is the highest. Fractures associated with limb-threatening vascular compromise should be reduced by the experienced emergency physician only when emergent orthopedic consultation is not available.
