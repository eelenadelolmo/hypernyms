Asymptomatic - Normal labs
No discrete treatment is indicated for asymptomatic Paget's disease of bone.  However, should the patient develop symptoms of pain or disability, anatomical imaging should be performed to evaluate for transformation to osteosarcoma.
Bone Scan:
Abnormal radiotracer uptake is present within the medial aspect of the left ilium adjacent to the sacroiliac joint which correlates directly with CT images of a mixed sclerotic and lytic focus. Â There is also increased uptake within the distal femurs which travels proximally to a "flame-shaped" tip in the distal 1/3 of the diaphyses, classical for Paget's disease. 

Uptake compatible with osteoarthritis is at the shoulders, the 
sternoclavicular joints, the left posterior 11th and right posterior 9th
ribs and left greater than right knees. Thoracic spine foci correlates directly with degenerative changes and pseudoarticulations on the CT images.

The kidneys are visualized without evident space-occupying lesion or 
obstruction. The right kidney is inferior and rotated in position, but not 
reduced in size, consistent with appearance on CT. The ureters are not
visualized, which is normal. The bladder appears usual in contour and
volume.
