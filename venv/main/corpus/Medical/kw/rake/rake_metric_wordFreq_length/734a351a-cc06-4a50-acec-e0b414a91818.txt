Symmetric, circumferential bands of heterotopic gray matter signal involve the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres.

Brain MRI was performed on a 49-year-old, moderately retarded woman, with generalized tonic-clonic and atypical absence seizures. She had been diagnosed with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome at the age of six. Family history was unavailable.
Each laminar heterotopion
Gray mater heteropia(plural noun, heterotopia; singular noun, heterotopion) occupies an intermediate position in the hemispheric white matter. Mildly shallow cortical sulci and moderate ventrigulomegaly are also noted.

On MR images of epileptic patients, various pathologies may demonstate a symmetric involvement of the cerebral hemispheres. Such lesions may go undetected by the unwary observer.

Subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) or double-cortex syndrome is an X-linked dominant malformation of neuronal migration. This disorder is classified with the classical (type 1) lissencephalies, otherwise known as the agyria-pachygyria-band spectrum of malformations. SBH has been linked to mutations in the XLIS (doublecortin)gene, which is located on the Xq22.3-23.

Patients with SBH have a variable clinical course ranging from normal development and intellectual ability to severe developmental delay and mental retardation. They almost always present with seizure disorders. In most patients an inverse correlation exists between cognitive levels and band thickness.
