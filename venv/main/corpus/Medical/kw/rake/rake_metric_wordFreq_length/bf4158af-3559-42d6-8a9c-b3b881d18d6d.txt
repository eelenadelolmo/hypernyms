The  appendix  is strikingly enlarged. An oval appendicolith is seen obstructing the proximal  aspect  of  the appendix.  High density debris is seen in the distal appendix as well. Small bubbles of air are seen anterior to the lumen of the appendix may be intramural or intraperitoneal. Minimal fat stranding is seen in the surrounding fat.  The walls of the cecum and terminal ileum are significantly thickened.
