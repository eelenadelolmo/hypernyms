Multiple axial CT images obtained at 5mm collimation through the lower abdomen demonstrate a multiloculated pancreatic mass with a central fibrous/calcified center. The Hounsfeld units are approximately 8 for this mass consistent with water density. The previous CT in 1995 demonstrates no change in the size or characteristics of this mass.
