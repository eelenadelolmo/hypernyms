Temp 100.8, BP 140/88, HR 70, RR 17.  Remainder of physical exam and labs were unavailable.
The prognosis for this patient is poor.  Possible therapies are palliative chemotherapy and palliative radiotherapy.  The pt was taken to the special procedures lab the day the chest film was read by a radiologist and the portion of the catheter was removed through an intravascular approach.
Study from December demonstrates increase in size and quantity of masses over all lung fields as compared to previous study of August in the same year.  Largest mass, measuring 3cm, is located peripherally in the left lung field.  There is prominent lymphadenopathy in both hila.  A 9.5 cm length of catheter is present in the left pulmonary artery and extends into the inferior branch.
Stage IV Melanoma
Migration of broken catheter
Mass Lesion:
Granulomatous disease
Inflammation
Benign neoplasm
Malignant primary
Metastatic disease
Congenital abnormality
52 y/o woman with hx of resected skin lesion.  Had latest PA and lateral done as part of a fever work up, with prior study in August 2004 and CT in November 2004.  Past surgical history consists of placement of a port-a-cath.
Complication rates.  Next to skin, subcutaneous tissue, and lymph nodes, the lungs are the most common sites of melanoma to metastasize.  This is thought to be due to the capillary beds in the lung parenchyma.  Once there is metastasis to the lungs or other distant sites, the disease is stage IV and has a 5-year survival of 8-10%.  Placement of indwelling catheters is not without complications.  At the time of insertion pneumothorax is a known complication.  Once in place complications include infection, thrombosis with possible SVC syndrome, erosion of SVC, PE and breakage with migration as in this case.  Migration of the catheter has its own complications to include pulmonary infarctions, PE, perforation and arrhythmias.
