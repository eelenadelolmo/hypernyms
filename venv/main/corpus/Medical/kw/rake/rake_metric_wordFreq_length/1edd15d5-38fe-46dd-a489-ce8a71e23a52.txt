Texto: 
Absence of respiratory sounds in the right chest. Laboratory: (routine) normal. Cardiologic exam: normal.
Ressection through a right postero-lateral thoracotomy. Figure 6 shows an aspect of the pedicle of the lesion attached to the parietal pleura and Figure 7 shows the 24 cm long and 2.3kg mass.
Patient with 1 year of follow-up without any sign of recurrence.
Chest X-ray: mass in upper third of right hemithorax that was probably pleural at the CT scan.
Chest X-ray four years later showed a massive lesion in the right chest that had the same aspect of the previous CT scan but a lot bigger.
The MRI showed a huge inhomogenous mass compressing the diaphragm but without evidences of invasion.
Solitary fibrous tumor of pleura confirmed by histology with immuno-histochemical profile.
1- Solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura.
2- Hemangiopericytoma.
3- Pleural sarcoma.
Female, caucasian, 74 years old, asymptomatic, had a routine chest X-rays done 4 years before. This exam showed a regular mass in the upper third of the right hemithorax (Fig. 1). A CT scan suggested a  pleural tumor as a possible diagnosis (Fig. 2). She refused a biopsy or a surgery that was the proposed treatment. She was lost of follow-up. Currently she came back with chest pain and shortness-of-breath and a new radiological study,including chest X-rays, CT scan and MRI (Fig. 3 to 5) showed that the lesion was 3 or 4 times bigger. At this point she accepted the operation.
The lesion was better treated if resected at the first visit 4 years before. This kind of tumor has a potential of malignancy and should be treated with complete resection.
