Afebrile. 
Scattered wheezes and rhonchi on exam.
None necessary.
Within the superior segment of the right lower lobe there is a
pulmonary nodule with a well-calcified central portion that measures 4 mm in diameter.  No other pulmonary nodules are present.  The lungs are otherwise clear without consolidation or pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature are within normallimits.  Visualized osseous and extrathoracic soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
Solitary Pulmonary Nodule - Calcified Granuloma
Benign Granuloma
43-year-old female with scattered wheezes and rhonchi on
exam.  Please evaluate to rule out infiltrate.
Proper Identification of a granuloma can prevent unneccessary radiation from a CT of the chest or a biopsy.
