Preoperative embolization with surgical resection.
MR: Well defined mass at the level of the carotid bifurcation on the left.  Isointense to muscle on T1, slightly hyperintense on T2 with enhancement on post-gadolinium sequences.  The ICA and ECA are slightly splayed.  Flow voids present on T2 image centrally.

CT:  Well defined enhancing mass at the level of the left carotid bifurcation.  Splays the ICA and ECA with partial encasement.

Angiography:  Highly vascular mass at carotid bifurcation with intense vascular blush. Post-emoblization demonstrates residual vascularity at the posterior lateral espect of the mass.
Carotid body tumor
For neck mass:
Carotid body tumor
Nodal metastasis
Nerve sheath tumor
Abscess
29 y/o woman with enlarging neck mass.
The patient underwent preoperative embolization and balloon test occlusion on the day prior to surgery.  The tumor was resected.  The patient had post-op vocal cord paralysis on the left.
