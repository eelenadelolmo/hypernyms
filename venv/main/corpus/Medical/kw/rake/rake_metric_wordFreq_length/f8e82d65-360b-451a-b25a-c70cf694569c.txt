Texto: 
Upon evaluation patient was found to have signs and clinical symptoms of obstruction consistent with cecal volvulus.
Surgical repair.
CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast showed decompression of the distal colon up to the ascending colon and mesenteric swirling sign in the region of the cecum with a dilated cecum consistent with cecal volvulus. No focal bowel wall thickening or mural gas to suggest ischemic bowel.
Cecal Volvulus
(1) Splenic flexure volvulus  
(2) Sigmoid volvulus 
(3) Bowel obstruction
(4) Bowel infarction
81-year-old male s/p PCI for severe 3-vessel disease who developed abdominal distention and pain, nausea, vomiting, lack of bowel movements, and obstipation.
