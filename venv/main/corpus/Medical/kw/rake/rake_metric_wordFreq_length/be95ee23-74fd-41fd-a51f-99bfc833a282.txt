Texto: 
R foot has a non-healing wound on its lateral aspect measuring 7 cm in length, 1.5 cm in width, and is approximately 2 cm in depth.  There is no drainage or foul odor noted from the wound. There is an inverted cavus type of foot deformity.
Continued management of foot ulcer with systemic antibiotics and local wound care. No need for surgical debridement or amputation currently due to lack of clinical and radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis/septic arthropathy. 
External fixator placement scheduled for later this month to start the multi-step process of attempting to return the foot to a neutral position.
1/13/10 RIGHT ANKLE 3 VIEWS 
FINDINGS: 
The ankle mortise is symmetric without evidence of degenerative change, or focal osteochondral lesion of the talar dome.  There is no evidence of fracture or dislocation.  Bone mineralization is normal for age without evidence of focal abnormality.  The achilles tendon shadow and soft tissues appear normal.
1/13/10 RIGHT FOOT 3 VIEWS
FINDINGS: 
Patient is status post resection of the fifth metatarsal for prior osteomyelitis.  No new sites of rarefaction, or periosteal reaction are observed to suggest an acute site of active osteomyelitis.  Lateral weight bearing views demonstrate supination of the foot, and flattening of the plantar arch (Calcaneal pitch is 12 degrees (normal is 20-25 degrees), Abnormal Mearyâ€™s angle).  Standing AP images reveal heel valgus with a talocalcaneal angle (between long axes of the talus and calcaneus) > 35 degrees. There is no evidence of fracture or dislocation.  Bone mineralization is normal for age without evidence of focal abnormality.  Focal soft tissue contour abnormality is present along the lateral aspect of the foot from prior surgery.  Soft tissues are otherwise normal.

An important negative finding is the lack of peripheral arterial calcification.
Charcot Arthropathy, i.e. neuropathic joints

62 y.o. man with polymicrobial chronic infection of his right lateral foot. s/p serial debridement â€™09 and 5th ray amputation 
DM x 3.5 years.
Peripheral neuropathy x 28 years
Hyperlipidemia

Spinal stenosis s/p L4-5 laminectomy, medial facetectomy decompression 6/08
Chronic foot deformity was identified on imaging. It is important to distinguish between charcot arthropathy peripheral vascular disease, and septic arthritis or osteomyelitis when evaluating a patient with a history of DM.

A foot ulcer as both entities present very similarly in the clinical setting (see below) as well as can co-occur in the same patient. This is due to the fact that charcot arthropathy due to neuropathy from DM predisposes to abnormal weight bearing and ulcer formation. 

Treatment is quite different between the two diagnoses: surgical/antibiotics for osteomyelitis versus follow up and orthotics for initial management of foot deformity. This patient had no evidence of osteomyelitis or septic arthritis and thus was managed non-operatively for his infection.
