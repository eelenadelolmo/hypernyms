Worsening right periorbital edema, erythema, and proptosis.
Antibiotics, abscess drainage, and sinus surgery.

After initial w/u (including CT), she was treated with antibiotics, surgical drainage and ethmoidectomy for orbital cellulitis, sinusitis, early subperiosteal abscess.  

Symptoms worsened and CT was repeated 3 days later.
Initial contrast-enhanced orbit CT on presentation showed pre- and post-septal cellulitis with edema and inflammatory stranding, lateral displacement of medial rectus muscle with heterogeneous soft tissue density mass medially adjacent to lamina papyracea (early small subperiosteal abscess), mild proptosis, and right ethmoid, maxillary, and frontal sinus opacification. 

Follow-up contrast-enhanced CT showed worsened right proptosis, increased size of subperiosteal abscess, and persistent pre-septal cellulitis and sinus opacification.
Subperiosteal orbital abscess
Pre- and Post-Septal Orbital Cellulitis with Subperiosteal Abscess secondary to ethmoid sinusitis
9 year old girl with sinus congestion and 2 day history of increasing right orbital swelling and pain.
Opacification of right concha bullosa also requires drainage during sinus surgery.
