CXR: Right sided aortic arch. Abnormal right sided mediastinal convexity with a right-sided aortic reflection.

CT: Right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery.  The order of the vessels off of the aortic arch is left common carotid, right common carotid, right subclavian, and left subclavian.
Right Sided Aortic Arch with Aberrant Left Subclavian Artery
Differential of chest x-ray:
- right arch with mirror image branching
- right arch with aberrant left subclavian
- double aortic arch
- any mediastinal mass
Asymptomatic screening chest x-ray.
