Texto: 
There is a physeal bar, which measures 1.0 cm in the coronal plane and 1.0 cm in the sagittal plane, at the dorsal-contral aspect of the physis of the radius.
Physeal Bar
This patient suffered a left wrist fracture with subsequent distal radius ORIF.
A physeal bar is a focal defect in the physis with resulting bony continuity between the epiphysis and metaphysis. As in this patient, trauma is the most common cause, with other etiologic factors including infection, irradiation, tumors, thermal or vascular injuries, corticosteroid use, and idiopathic causes.  Common sequelae of untreated physeal bars are limb-length discrepancy, angulation deformity, or both. It is postulated that transverse fracture-separations that extend to the juxtaepiphyseal region of the physis are more likely to disturb growth.

Treatment options of physeal bars include contralateral physeal arrest, osteotomy, and physeal bar excision.  With substantial limb-length discrepancies, lengthening of the short bone (or shortening of the contralateral long bone) are options, in cases of physeal closure. However, no treatment may be necessary if the child is near physiologic closure of the physis.

Assessment of physeal bars requires knowledge of the size, location, and contour of the bar. Bars that occupy more than 50% of the total growth plate are less likely to have a favorable outcome after excision. MR has been demonstrated to be useful in the evaluation of physeal bars, and may reveal juxtaepiphyseal injuries. Plain radiography and multiple-plane tomography have also been used in the past.
