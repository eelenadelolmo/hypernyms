ERCP vs cholecystectomy and duct exploration.
Normal hepatic echotecture. Diffusely dilated intrahepatic bile ducts.  Common duct at level of the crossing of the hepatic artery is >5mm, and the duct contains multiple echogenic stones.  Small stone is lodged in the distal CBD, possibly at the ampulla.  The gallbladder is filled approximately 1/2-2/3 full of sludge, however there is no evidence of inflammation.

Jaundiced 14yo female with HbSS disease and worsening midepigastric pain.
This patient has obvious choledocholithiasis and obstruction.  In the pediatric / adolescent population, this can be due to several potential causes. She is know to have hemolytic anemia and is thus prone to biliary stasis and sludge.  The sludge eventually forms stones, which in this case were numerous and resulted in frank obstruction of the entire biliary system.  In this case, a stone is seen at the ampulla of Vater.  The common duct, measured at the point the hepatic artery crosses, should be no wider than 4mm in this age group.  Intrahepatic ducts should not be so easily visible.
