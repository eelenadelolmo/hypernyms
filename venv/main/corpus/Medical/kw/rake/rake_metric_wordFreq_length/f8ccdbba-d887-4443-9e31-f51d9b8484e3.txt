Radiology and Pathology:

Fig 1. Non-contrast enhanced MRI showing large intraocular mass arising from the temporal portion of the globe. 

Fig 2. Contrast enhanced MRI showing the large intraocular mass.

Fig 3. Gross specimen showing the large, nearly black tumor.

Fig 4. Macrosection showing the tumor arising from the choroid beneath the intact retina. The tumor is very large and deeply pigmented. 

Fig 5. Histologically, the tumor was composed predominantly of plump, spindle-shaped cells with abundant cytoplasmic pigment.

Fig 6. Higher magnification showed most of the nuclei to be vesicular with prominent nucleoli.  Occasional epithelioid cells were also present.
Intraocular spindle B melanoma
This 45 year old woman developed painless loss of vision in her right eye. Examination of the eye showed visual acuity of 1/200, with a dark brown mass extending across the pupillary aperture and obscuring visualization of the optic nerve. An orbital MRI was obtained.
