Surgical excision with chemotherapy and continuation of regular screening exams.
There is a mass in the central portion of the left kidney that is hypoenhancing relative to the normal renal parenchyma.  The kidney itself is markedly enlarged with severe calyceal dilation.  The right kidney has post-surgical changes in the inferior pole consistent with prior Wilmâ€™s Tumor extraction.  There is no evidence of  vascular invasion or para-aortic lymphadenopathy and the remainder of the abdomen appears grossly normal.

The patient is an asymptomatic 5-year-old male who presents with a known history of nephroblastomatosis and prior right-sided Wilm's Tumor for a routine, screening abdominal MRI.
