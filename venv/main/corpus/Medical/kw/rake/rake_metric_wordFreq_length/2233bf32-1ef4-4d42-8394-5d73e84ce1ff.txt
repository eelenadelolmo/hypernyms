Management of high-grade astrocytomas is a multi-step process, including treatment with glucocorticoids, surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.  Administration of dexamethasone is usually initiated at the time of diagnosis and tapered to the lowest tolerated dose when radiation therapy is completed.  Due to the invasive nature of high-grade astrocytomas, complete surgical resection is not possible.  Therefore, surgery is only indicated to obtain tissue for pathologic diagnosis and control mass effects.  In patients younger than 65, the extent of tumor resection correlates with survival, so accessible tumors are resected aggressively in this population if the patient is otherwise healthy.  Following surgery, radiation therapy is administered.  Focal radiation has been shown to be as effective and less toxic in this patient population, and is administered to the tumor mass, plus a 3-4-cm margin.  A total dose of 5000 to 7000 cGy is administered in 25-35 equal fractions, 5 days per week.  Finally, chemotherapy is initiated.  This is only marginally effective, but is usually added as an adjuvant, following surgery and radiation therapy.  The most effective available agents are nitrosoureas, such as carmustine (BCNU) and lomustine (CCNU).
MRI w/ contrast: Within the L cerebral hemisphere, in the frontoparietal region, there is marked increased white matter signal throughout, with a mild amount of midline shift of the falx.  Posteriorly in this region there is a cystic lesion that does not enhance.  The largest single cyst measures approximately 6mm, with the overall largest size of the cluster of cysts measuring 10mm.  There is also an extensive amount of edema, and at the area of midline shift of the falx, there is some increased white matter signal in the right hemisphere which may represent tumoral extension across the corpus colosum.  There is some edema and effacement of the cerebral sulci on the left at the level of the lesion.  The remaining soft tissues are unremarkable.
Anaplastic astrocytoma - WHO Grade 3
High-grade astrocytoma, oligodendroglial tumor, mixed glioma, ependymal tumor, infarction, or metastasis
28 yo  c/o right leg weakness.  He denies headaches, nausea, vomiting, or vision changes.  Currently complains of right leg weakness, slight sensory decrease and, and possible difficulty talking.
CT showed left frontal-parietal lesion w/ edema and minimal shift.  Patient was transferred to NNMC for further w/u.
