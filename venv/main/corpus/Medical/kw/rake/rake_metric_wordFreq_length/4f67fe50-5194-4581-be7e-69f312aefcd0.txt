Patient had tachycardia (120 bpm), elevated blood pressure (150/95), and slight tachypnea (18 resp/min). Lungs were clear.
Chemotherapy and surgical excision.
Axial post-contrast CT images throught the mid chest.

In the upper outer quadrant of the left breast, there is an abnormal angular mass. It warrants further evaluation with a diagnostic mammogram.

There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
Breast, Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, poorly differentiated.
53 year old woman presented to the ED complaining of sudden onset of 10/10 pain in the chest/back region, shortness of breath, and "palpatations".
Given the patients symptoms/rapid onset, the emergency physician was concerned for the presence of thoracic aorta pathology versus acute pulmonary embolism.

The patient was initially evaluated for possible presence of either acute pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic aneurysm/dissection due to the severity and rapid onset of pain. 

The patient's pain during the initial ER visit was determined to be pleurisy, secondary to a previous community acquired pneumonia.  The breast nodule was incidentally noted during the CT-PE protocol and was subsequently recommended for immediate follow-up.

Once the patient has been ruled-out for pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic pathology, a focal breast mass might be overlooked due to its peripheral location on the cross sectional imaging. 

This case is a good example of the importance of evaluating all structures imaged.
