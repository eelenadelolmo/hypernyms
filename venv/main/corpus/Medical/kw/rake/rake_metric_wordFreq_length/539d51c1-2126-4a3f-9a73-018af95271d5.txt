surgical correction
• double aortic arch creating complete vascular ring with right arch dominance measuring 7mm in diameter and left arch measuring 5mm in diameter
• right arch ascends 6mm higher than left
• right carotid and subclavian aa arise from right arch and left carotid and subclavian aa arise from left arch.
• trachea and esophagus are constrained; maximum constraint by vascular ring results in trachea with reduced diameter from 4.5mm to 2mm and a completely collapsed esophagus
• small azygous lobe
• right middle lobe consolidation
Double aortic arch
• tracheoesophageal fistula/esophageal atresia
• double aortic arch-vascular ring
