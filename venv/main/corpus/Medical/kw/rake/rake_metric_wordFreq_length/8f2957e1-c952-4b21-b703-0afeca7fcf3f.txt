Radiation and chemotherapy
Expansile mass lesion involving the splenium of the corpus callosum.  The mass enhances homogeneously and produces a moderate amount of surrounding vasogenic edema.  The mass is not particularly bright on FLAIR and T2.

58 year old man with 2 month history of personality changes and headache.
The increased cellularity of "small round blue cell tumors" - like lymphoma - often has a characteristic imaging appearance of high attenuation on pre-contrast CT, low signal on T1 and T2 MR, and low ADC/high signal on DWI.
