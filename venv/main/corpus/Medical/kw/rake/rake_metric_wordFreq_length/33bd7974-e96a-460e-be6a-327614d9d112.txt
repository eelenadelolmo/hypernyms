General: AAOx3, obvious distress. Vitals: Tachycardia, tachypnea.  Abdomen: soft, mild distention, direct tenderness to LUQ with guarding, no ecchymosis or bleeding
Labs: CBC- within normal limits, Amylase/Lipase- within normal limits, CMP- within normal limits
Surigcal intervention is routinely saved for those patient's who do not respond to conservative management.  No surgery was required in this case with patientâ€™s symptoms improving with 3 days of inpatient bowel rest and pain management.
CT Abdomen with contrast- Anterior inferior spleen demonstrates small area of heterogeneous hypodensity, measuring 2.7cm AP x 1.5 cm transverse x 3cm craniocaudal, consistent with laceration and associated hematoma.  Three other areas with additional lacerations.  No evidence of active bleed.
Splenic Laceration
In the setting of trauma, splenic laceration and/or hematoma is the only reasonable diagnosis. Possible non-traumatic diagnoses may include splenic infarction, abscess, pancreatic pseudocyst, or lymphoma. This patient's symptoms were also concerning for a possible small bowel obstruction at the time of initial presentation.
27 y/o Male presents to Emergency Room with few hours of LUQ pain and nausea after falling while snowboarding with phone in chest pocket.
The spleen is the most commonly injured solid abdominal organ following significant blunt trauma. Contrast enhanced CT is the modality of choice when evaluating the abdomen for a possible splenic laceration or hematoma. 50-70% of cases are managed conservatively with observation while higher grade injuries require surgical exploration and possible splenectomy.   The American Association for Surgery of Trauma has published a grading system for splenic lacerations.  
Grade I â€“ Hematoma: subcapsular, <10 percent of surface area. Laceration: capsular tear <1 cm in depth into the parenchyma.
Grade II â€“ Hematoma: subcapsular, 10 to 50 percent of surface area. Laceration: capsular tear, 1 to 3 cm in depth, but not involving a trabecular vessel.
Grade III â€“ Hematoma: subcapsular, >50 percent of surface area OR expanding, ruptured subcapsular or parenchymal hematoma OR intraparenchymal hematoma >5 cm or expanding. Laceration: >3 cm in depth or involving a trabecular vessel.
Grade IV â€“ Laceration involving segmental or hilar vessels with major devascularization (ie, >25 percent of spleen).
Grade V â€“ Hematoma: shattered spleen. Laceration: hilar vascular injury which devascularizes spleen.
