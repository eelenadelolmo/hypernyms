Patient is currently undergoing radiation therapy.
CT: Low attenuation focus in the post left parietal lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema. Second lesion in the left temporal lobe, with irregular central high attenuation consistent with hemorrhage. There is not a clear connection between the two discrete lesions. The cerebral sulci and left lateral ventricle are effaced, and there is mild midline shift.

MR: Left posterior parietal and left temporal lesions with peripheral enhancement, and surrounding vasogenic edema. The temporal lesion has very low central signal on T2 weighted images. Mass effect as seen on CT.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DDx: The primary differential for most brain lesions is metastatic disease vs. primary malignancy vs infection (abscess). A mnemonic for ring enhancing lesions is MAGICAL DR:

Metastatic Disease – may favor due to multiplicity and 
  hemorrhage
Abscess/Cerebritis – hemorrhage would be atypical,and  
  not febrile
GBM – multicentric GBM also common, and can hemorrhage
Ischemic: Hemorrhagic stroke – despite known 
  hypertension, unlikely to have defined enhancing 
  tissue
Contusion – no history of trauma, and unlikely with 
  enhancing soft tissue mass
AIDs: Toxo – no history to suggest
Lymphoma – would be atypical in an otherwise healthy 
  individual
Demylinating Disease – hemorrhage would be 
  uncharateristic, and not comon
Radiation Necrosis – no history of radiation therapy
61 year old white male with 2 weeks of difficulty concentrating and remembering, slower movements. High blood pressure, otherwise healthy, though wife has noticed subtle changes in mentation over last 6 months
This gentleman’s acute presentation is likely due to acute hemorrhage.

GBMs are the most malignant of all gliomas (WHO Grade IV). They are the most common primary brain tumor, occuring in all ages with peak at 65-75 years of age. The are more common in men (men > women 3:2), and more common in whites. They can be associated with certain conditions, to included Turcot syndrome, neurofibromatosis type-1 and Li-Faumeni syndrome. GBMs prefer the hemispheric white matter, frontal more than temporal. 

GBMs are most commonly a solitary lesion, but they can be multifocal in 2-5% of cases. 5% of lesions will present with hemorrhage; they rarely calcify. They can also present as a “butterfly glioma,” crossing the midline, usually across the corpus callosum. They can present as a primary leptomeningeal tumor, or metastasize by meningeal or subependymal routes.
