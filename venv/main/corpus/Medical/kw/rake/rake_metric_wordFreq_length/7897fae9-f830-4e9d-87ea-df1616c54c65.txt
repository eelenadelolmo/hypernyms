Abscess
Gastric Diverticulum
Bowel loop
Pelvic abscess.  Suspicion of abdominal abscess.
Gastric diverticula can be mistaken for other lesions, most often as an adrenal abnormality.  In this case, one might consider abscess but the diverticulum could be easily demonstrated with endoscopy or decubitus CT.  This patient was too ill to perform an upper GI barium study which is the least expensive and most expeditious means of demonstrating gastric diverticulum.
