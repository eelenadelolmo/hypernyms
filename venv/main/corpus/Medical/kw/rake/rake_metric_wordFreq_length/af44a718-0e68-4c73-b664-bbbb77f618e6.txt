The patient could recall 2 out of 3 objects after 5 minutes on mini mental status exam.  She also had a right hemianopsia on physical examination.
Surgical resection and follow-up imaging
5cm x 4cm x 4.4cm cystic intra-axial mass with internal septations within the left occipital lobe.  The mass affects the cortex and causes mass effect.   The septations show post-gadolinium enhancement.  There is a nodule at the base of the lesion and a curvilinear area at the anterior and superior aspects of the lesion which are hyperintense on pre-gadolinium T1 images - that may represent blood products.  There is an area of increased FLAIR signal surrounding the lesion that is consistent with intraaxial vasogenic edema.  There is a 4mm left-to-right midline shift.  This lesion also demonstrates increased perfusion.
Meningeal Hemangiopericytoma
• Glioblastoma Multiforme
• Meningioma
• Oligodendroglioma
• Hemangiopericytoma
• Dural metastatsis (e.g. breast Ca, Lymphoma)
• Sarcoid
• PNET
35 yo woman without significant past medical history who presents with a 2 week h/o headache and blurry vision.  Episodes of nausea/vomiting 3 days before presentation.
Meningeal hemangiopericytomas are rare malignant primary CNS neoplasms that arise from the pericytes that surround the endothelial lining of capillaries and venules.  They make up 2.5% of meningeal tumors and 1% of intracranial tumors. The average age at diagnosis is 40 years old and these tumors are more common in men than women.  Seventy percent of hemangiopericytomas are supratentorial while 15% are found in the posterior fossa and 15% percent are spinal.  Patients with supratentorial hemangiopericytomas often present with headache or a focal neurological deficit with only 16% presenting with seizures.  

CT reveals a hyperdense lesion with focal areas of hypodensity and heterogeneous enhancement.  Bone erosion can also be detected on CT.  MRI often shows T1 and T2 isointensity with flow voids.  There is also heterogeneous enhancement.  Fifty percent will have a dural tail sign.  There may be a corkscrew vascular configuration.  

Meningeal hemangiopericytomas are aggressive tumors.  After gross resection, these tumors often recur locally, along the neuraxis or outside the CNS (eg bone, lung, liver)  Radiation therapy appears to increase disease-free survival and overall survival.
