11 yo girl with "failure to thrive".   The child has had increased hunger recently, but eats only small amounts at a time because she gets full quickly and her â€œbelly achesâ€.  The mother stated that that the child had always had a round belly and also suffered from â€œlow ironâ€ for quite some time.
This patient had incomplete tumor resection and has been treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.  She has no progression of disease to date.
