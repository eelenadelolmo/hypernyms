Pt had a insignificant physical exam. Pt's labs were significant for AFP-6188, B-HCG-110, LDH-3101.
Pt had 4 cycles of BEP chemotherapy tx with reduction in size of mass and normalizing tumor markers. Pt most recently underwent median sternotomy to resect residual mass
CXR- PA/LAT- showed Large anterior mediastinal mass
CT Chest- Confirmation of large anterior mediastinal mass with mixed attenuation. The mass exerts considerable mass effect on other mediastinal structures.
Anterior mediastinal nonseminomatous germ cell tumor
Thymoma
Terrible Lymphoma
Thyroid carcinoma
Germ Cell tumor (Teratoma, SGCT, NSGCT)
