Texto: 
Exam c/w hip flexor strain, negative heel tap, + hop test, cannot r/o fem neck stress fx.
Compressive aspect fracture usually managed conservatively. In this case, management was surgical.
XR: An extremely subtle, sclerotic area is noted at the medial
intertrochanteric line.

MR: There is a large amount of marrow edema within the right femoral neck in the basicervical region along the posterior medial femoral neck. There is linear T1 and T2 signal hypointensity present at the posteromedial cortex in the basicervical region, consistent with an incomplete stress
fracture.  This extends approximately one-quarter to one-third through the width of the femoral neck at this location.  The marrow signal is, otherwise, normal.  No evidence of avascular necrosis of the femoral head.  The
acetabular labrum is intact.  No evidence of joint effusion.
Femoral Neck Stress Fracture
Femoral Neck Stress Fracture, acute.
Persistent pain in right hip after recent increase in running.
Surgical management d/t patient's inability to remain non-weightbearing for significant interval.
