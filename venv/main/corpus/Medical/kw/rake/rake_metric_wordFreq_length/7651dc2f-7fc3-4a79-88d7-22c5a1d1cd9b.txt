Chronic right sided nasal obstruction and inability to breathe though the right nares.
A purely membranous atresia can be treated surgically
Narrowing of the right choanal air space and a membranous connection between the right palantine bone and the vomer.  The vomer is of normal thickness.
Choanal Atresia and Congenital Nasal Airway Obstruction
Unilateral chaonal atresia
priform sinus aperture narrowing
midnose stenosis
Three year old female with chronic nasal congestion and difficulty breathing.  The child was diagnosed with suspected unilateral choanal atresia by prior ENT evaluation.
Unilateral choanal atresia can often go undiagnosed due to the patient's ability to breath from the one side as an infant.  As was the case in this child the condition was not suspected until much later after chonic complaints of congestion and inability to breathe well.
