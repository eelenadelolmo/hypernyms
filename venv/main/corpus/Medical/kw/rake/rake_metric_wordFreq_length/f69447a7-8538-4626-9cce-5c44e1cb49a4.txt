Findings include numerous dense, thin, short filaments within soft tissues, predominantly in her back.
Retained acupuncture needles. 
When questioned, patient admitted that as a complementary treatment to her mastectomy 30 years ago, she received acupuncture. Gold needles were used in a technique which intentionally retained them into the patient’s body.  She denied any pain or skin changes from the retained needles.
76 year old Asian woman for barium swallow and upper GI study. History of breast cancer 30 years prior.
The findings in this radiograph are likely from a technique of acupuncture practiced principally in Japan called okibari or maibotsushin. This differs from conventional acupuncture in that the needles are left permanently in position. They are inserted to the desired depth and then broken off at the skin surface. Several dozen needles of gold, silver or stainless steel may be inserted at one session.
