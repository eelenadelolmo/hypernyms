Other than complaining of pain, the patient appeared to be clinically well. His abdomen was soft, relatively non-tender to palpation without  involuntary guarding or rebound tenderness. 

Serum lactate mildly elevated. No electrolyte abnormality. No acute decrease in hemoglobin or hematocrit.
Due to concern that the proximity of the high grade AV fistula would prevent concentration of chemical thrombolytic agents in the thrombo-embolis by preferential flow of blood into the portal venous system, endovascular therapy was not attempted.

Instead, the high grade AV fistula and a segment of associated ischemic bowel were resected. Given that the rest of the hollow and solid organs in the vascular territories of the celiac and SMA appeared normal during surgery, the vascular surgeon opted to not perform thrombectomies.
Axial images from enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrate thrombus occluding the celiac plexus and the distal superior mesenteric artery. No focal bowel wall thickening, pneumatosis intestinalis, venous gas, solid organ infarction or venous thrombosis was seen. Angiography confirmed these occlusions and diagnosed an unsuspected high grade AV fistula of a jejunal artery to a jejunal vein. The etiology of this fistula remains unknown.
Acute mesenteric ischemia
Occlusive acute mesenteric ischemia: 
1. Emboli (atrial fibrillation, ventricular aneurysm)
2. Arterial thrombosis (atherosclerotic)
3. Venous thrombosis (portal hypertension, pancreatitis, tumor)
 
Non-occlusive AMI:
1. Hypoperfusion
2. Hypovolemia
Middle aged man presents with acute onset abdominal pain which is "out of proportion" to physical exam.
Although limited, the experience with endovascular management of acute mesenteric ischemia due to emboli with thrombolysis is growing. At our institution, a combination of catheter directed intra-arterial t-PA (alteplase) and systemic intravenous heparin is administered in either the angiography suite or the intensive care unit to ensure close monitoring for bleeding complications. Vascular surgery is closely involved in the event of a bleeding complication or complication of ischemic bowel.

Fibrinogen levels are used to adjust t-PA infusion rate and PTT levels are used to adjust the heparin infusion rate. Since t-PA and herapin have a synergistic effect, the range of appropriate PTT levels is lower than for typical systemic anticoagulation.  Also, to minimize potential bleeding, fibrinogen and PTT levels are drawn off of the flush line for the vascular sheath.

Typically, progress of thrombolysis is assessed every 8 to 12 hours with catheter angiography and, if necessary, the infusion catheter is repositioned. Treatment is typically stopped after 36 hours at which time the risk of bleeding complication usually outweighs the probability that a yet unlysed clot will open up.
