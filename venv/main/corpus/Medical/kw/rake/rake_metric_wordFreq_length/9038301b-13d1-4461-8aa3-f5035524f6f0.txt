Slightly decreased range of motion at 3rd metacarpal phalangeal joint.  Non-tender palpable mass.
At the time of submission it is not known whether the patient symptoms secondary to mechanical stress and slightly decreased range of motion were of such severity to consider surgical resection of this lesion.
AP and oblique images of the left third digit demonstrate a 1.5 cm by .6 cm calcified lesion at the dorsal/radial base of the 3rd proximal phalanx.  The border of this ossification has a fine cortical margin.  Although demonstration of complete separation from the phalanx is not conclusive, the oblique view demonstrates that this is likely the case.

The phalanx is normal, without any periosteal changes.  The joint spaces are preserved.  There is no obvious soft tissue component.

25 year old active duty male with complaint of mass at the base of the middle finger.  No specific history of trauma.  Insidious onset of mass.
Despite lack of specific history of trauma to the hand, the diagnosis of myositis ossificans (MO) can still be made.  A significantly large percentage of cases of MO do not have a specific history of trauma.

If we had prior radiographs demonstrating stability; or, an earler image showing peripheral ossification with subsequent progression of the ossification centrally - they would also support the diagnosis of MO.
