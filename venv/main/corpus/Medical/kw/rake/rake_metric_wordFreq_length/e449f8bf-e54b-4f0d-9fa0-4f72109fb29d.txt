Nasal examination: A dirty white mass could be seen inside the right nasal cavity, gritty and stony hard to touch.  The whole nasal cavity was filled with the mass.
Blood examination - Normal
Xray paranasal sinuses - Radio opaque mass seen occupying the right nasal cavity.
CT scan para nasal sinuses 
Xray chest PA view - Normal
Lateral rhinotomy was performed.  Rhinolith was extricated.
CT scan:
Irregular radiodense mass occupying the right nasal cavity. 
Paranasal sinuses normal
Rhinolith
• Rhinolith
• Osteoma
57 y.o. with a sensation of "blocked" right nose 15 years
Serosanguinous discharge - right nose 10 years
Feeling of gritty mass in the right nose 8 years
Bleeding from right nostril - 15 days
Since the mass was huge, removal through the nasal cavity could traumatize the nasal mucosa.  Hence, a lateral rhinotomy was done and the rhinolith was removed safely.
