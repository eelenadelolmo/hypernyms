Texto: 
Vital signs stable, well nourished, well developed, and no acute distress; exam remarkable for local tenderness to palpation at L hip; mildly reduced range of motion (ROM) in L hip; mild pain with passive ROM; moderate pain with active ROM; no erythema, edema, or swelling; no weakness or sensorimotor deficit; no rash. CBC and BMP were normal, +ANA, + APA, ESR 72.
Rest, analgesiscs, limited weight-bearing, orthopedic referral for further evaluation (core decompression vs. osteotomy vs. arthroplasty)
1. AP and lateral radiographs show a C-shaped area of sclerosis 
2. T1W coronal MR image - shows focal area of low signal intensity in the R femoral head consistent with edema; also shows focal area of high signal intensity in the L femoral head surrounded by low signal intensity margin consistent with central fat and peripheral circumferential edema of the head and extension of the edema to the meta-diaphysis; additionally, there is evidence of a focal depression of the L femoral head and irregular L femoral epiphysis. 
3. FSE T2W with fat-sat coronal MR image â€“ shows high signal intensity of edema in the R femoral head; also shows high signal intensity of edema surrounding the low signal intensity fat of the L femoral head with extension to the L femoral diaphysis 4. FSE proton density with fat-sat sagittal MR image - no collapse evident
Avascular necrosis (AVN) of femoral heads bilaterally
Nearly pathognomonic for AVN
Patient with history of SLE and corticosteroid use presents with L hip/groin that is exacerbated by activity and gradually worsening over several months but more so over last 2 weeks; denies red/hot/swollen L hip, trauma, recent increases in activity level, pain worse at night, recent illness, fevers/ chills/night sweats, new sexual contacts, or vesicular rash.
