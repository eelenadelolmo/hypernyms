Physical Exam:  
No abnormalities.

Labs:
- Fungal, acid-fast, and Gram stains showed no  organisms.  
- Pleural fluid analysis was suspicious for malignancy.
- Histopathologic analysis of tissue samples of all three right lung lobes including mediastinal lymph nodes revealed extensive lymphovascular invasion, focal areas of necrosis, and several areas with signet-ring cells.
The patient was initially treated for pneumonia based on her symptoms and the findings on chest x-ray.  Further evaluation was completed after recurrence of symptoms within one month of therapy.  VATS and mediastinoscopy were performed after bronchoalveolar lavage yielded cells suspicious for malignancy.  A whole body PET scan and brain MRI were performed and did not reveal any evidence of distant metastases.  Chemotherapy was initiated and the patient later underwent a right-sided pneumonectomy.
Chest PA/LAT revealed increased interstitial markings in the right lower lobe.

Contrast enhanced chest CT revealed diffuse increased interstitial markings involving the right middle and lower lobes, pleural thickening/scarring of the posterior right lower lobe, and a small right-sided pleural effusion.

The patient is a 43-year-old female who presented with a 6-month history of progressively worsening shortness of breath with exertion during her 5-mile runs.  The patient also complained of wheezing but denied having a cough, fevers, chills, or weight loss.  This patient does not have a previous history of any chronic illnesses and does not have any history of tobacco use.
Lung cancer must be ruled out in any patient with a nonresolving pneumonia.  Lung cancer has surpassed breast cancer in becoming the leading cause of cancer death in women. Adenocarcinoma accounts for 30-40% of lung cancers and is the most common histologic type.  It is also the most common type of lung cancer in non-smokers (an estimated 10-15% of patients diagnosed with lung cancer are non-smokers).  The most common sites of distant metastases are the brain, bones (most commonly vertebrae), liver, adrenals, and skin.  The American Thoracic Society recommends measurement of a CBC, serum electrolytes, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, and creatinine in all patients with lung cancer.  Abnormal LFTs should be followed up with a contrast-enhanced CT of the liver, and an elevated alkaline phosphatase or calcium level should be followed up with a bone or PET scan to detect metastases (there is conflicting evidence as to which imaging modality has greater sensitivity).  Stage IV disease is primarily managed with chemotherapy or with palliative measures for symptomatic relief, and the five year survival rate is less than 5%.
