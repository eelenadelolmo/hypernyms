Patient is a 10 year old female initially seen by the PCP for nausea, vomiting, and headache over the right orbital/temporal region. Her symptoms were initially attributed to sinus disease for which she began a course of amoxicillin. Her symptoms did not improve and she was switched to Cefuroxime.  She was then seen again by the PCP due to worsening headache, right eye pain, and worsening intermittent double vision over the last month, more noticeably within the last week. She was then referred to the ophthalmology clinic for ophthalmoplegia and inability to fully elevate the right eyelid.
In this patient, the inability to look superiorly is due to involvement of CN IV. The trochlear nerve innervates the superior oblique muscle.  CN VI involvement is demonstrated with the inability to gaze laterally.  The abducens nerve innervates the lateral rectus muscle allowing for lateral gaze.  CN III involvement seen with ptosis. The eyelids are elevated by the contraction of the levator palpebrae superioris which is innervated by CNIII.  CN V1 involvement resulted in loss of corneal reflex as it provides the sensory fibers to the eye.
