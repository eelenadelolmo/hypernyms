Texto: 
focal abnormal neurological deficit and atrophy of left scapular muscles
Follow up imaging revealed mild unco-vertebral degeneration at C5-6, with mild NF compromise.
edema and atrophy Supra/Infra spinatus muscles
no abnormalities in suprascapular notch
Sub and supra scapular atrophy
suprascapular nerve entrapment syndrome (not supported by normal ss notch)
Parsonage-Turner Syndrome (idiopathic)
focal lesion proximaly in brachial plexus or CNS
40 y/o active man with chronic left shoulder pain, recently becoming worse.  Pain with history of acute onset following mild trauma (fell out of chair).
The images of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus atrophy are suggestive of a classic entrapment picture, however imaging of the suprascapular nerve as it courses through the suprascapular notch reveals no abnormality.  Neurological testing (EMG) and physical exam confirmed the primary finding of atrophy.  Further imaging revealed no abnormalities within the brachial plexus.  C-Spine MRI showed cervical spondyloarthropathy at the levels that could cause these symptoms, but the most pronounced osseous degeneration was higher within the cervical spine.  All in all, no conclusive dx is made for the cause of the muscular atrophy, but Parsonage-Turner seems most likely.
