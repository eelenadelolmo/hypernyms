Unremarkable.
This case is reported, because is is a good demonstration of how the radiologist can be of assistence to the surgeon is assessing the success of the decompression intraoperatively.
â€¢ Partial agenesis of the Corpus Callosum
â€¢ Cerebellar tonsil herniation through foramen magnum to a mid-dens level.

On the intraoperative images, note that the CSF flow velocity is now normal after the bony decompression.
Chiari I Malformation
There are a variety of classifications of Chiari malformations.  See factoid for details.
3 year old girl with a history of large head, developmental delay, phase out spells, and falls.
In decompressing the Chiari 1 malformation, the surgeon will first removed the posterior bony elements at the level of the obstruction.  The adequacy of decompression is assessed intraoperatively by measuring the velocity of CSF flow just caudal to the cerebellar tonsils.  If the bony decompression does not completely relieve the obstruction, the dura will be opened and frequently multiple fibrous bands will need to be lysed.  Intraoperative US is then used to confirm that the CSF velocity has reurned to normal.
