Aberent posterior communicating artery
Persistent trigeminal artery
64 year old male with a history of subdural hematoma drained via crainiotomy in January 2007.  Follow-up examination including CT and MRA preformed in June of 2007 showed no residual parenchymal injury, hematoma, or secondary hydrocephalus.  However, an incidental finding was made.
The patient did not have any symptoms due to this anatomic variation.  However, these patients are prone to develop aneurysms of the trigeminal artery and may experience pulsitile tinnitus or trigeminal neuralgia.
