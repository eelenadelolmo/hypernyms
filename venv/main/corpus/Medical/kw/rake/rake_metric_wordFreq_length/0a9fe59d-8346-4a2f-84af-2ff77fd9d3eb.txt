Texto: 
There is a 3 cm (craniocaudal dimension) diverticulum off the inferolateral
cervical esophagus that fills promptly and empties promptly with swallowing.
This diverticulum freely communicates with the esophagus and retains a small
amount of contrast.  The remainder of the esophagus appears grossly normal.

A left lateral diverticulum off the cervical esophagus, consistent with a
Killian-Jamieson diverticulum.
Killian-Jamieson Diverticulum
Cystic lesion at the cervical thoracic junction seen on CT.
