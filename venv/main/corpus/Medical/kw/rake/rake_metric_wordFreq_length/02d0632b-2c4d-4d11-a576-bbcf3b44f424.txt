Physical exam of right breast demonstrates a firm mobile nontender lump in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast
No treatment is indicated. The patient was otherwise asymptomatic and had no anxiety concerning the cyst.
Mammographic images demonstrate a well defined, spherical, lucent mass with a thin calcified rim within the breast parenchyma.

Ultrasound images demonstrate a well defined hypoechoic ovoid mass with a thin capsule, edge shadows, and no posterior acoustic enhancement.

MRI demonstrates a well defined, nonenhancing mass with a thin capsule with fat signal content characteristics.
Liponecrosis Macrocystica Calcificans (Oil cyst)
Oil cyst (Fat Necrosis)
Lipoma
Harmartoma (fibroadenolipoma)
31 year old female presents for diagnostic mammogram for palpable right breast lump. Patient states mass enlarging over past 11-12 months during pregnancy however stable to slightly decreased in size since cessation of lactation 2 months prior.
Although, the MRI examination confirmed the lipid content and benign nature of the mass, stopping the evaluation with only the mammogram and ultrasound findings could also be justified.
