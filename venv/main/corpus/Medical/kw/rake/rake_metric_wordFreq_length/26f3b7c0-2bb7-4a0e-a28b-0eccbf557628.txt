Normal WBC count.  UA had RBC's but inconclusive because patient currently menstruating. Right CVA tenderness.
The patient was treated with low-molecular-weight heparin  for 5 days, followed by warfarin therapy (target INR of 2.0-3.0) for 6 months.
Initial non-con Stone Protocol CT exam: There was no renal calculi, hydronephrosis or further renal abnormality present.  On the images through the lung bases, there is a peripheral wedge shaped opacity in the right lower lobe posterior basal segment.  Possibility of pulmonary infarct was raised by the radiologist, CT pulmonary angiogram was recommended.

CT pulmonary angiogram:  Within the LUL and the Lingular segmental pulmonary arteries are filling defects consistent with pulmonary emboli.  Additionally in a subsegmental branch of the RLL, there is a filling defect consistent with another pulmonary embolism.  On the lung windows, distal to this PE, again identified is a wedge shaped, peripherally based opacity, consistent with a pulmonary infarct.
Pulmonary Embolism with RLL Pulmonary Infarct.
After the CT PE protocol, no DDX.
34 year old female smoker, on OCPs, presents to the ER with right flank pain and remote history of renal stone disease.
This particular case was interesting because the patient initially presented as "renal colic", however, it turned out that her flank pain was coming from a right lower lobe pulmonary infarction.

CT-pathologic correlation has demonstrated that the finding of wedge-shaped opacity at CT is likely to represent pulmonary infarction, that is, an area of lung filled with red blood cells with or without tissue necrosis. The triangular configuration corresponds to increased attenuation within several affected secondary pulmonary lobules, with a broad base abutting a peripheral pleural surface and often with a truncated apex. The reported prevalence of pulmonary infarction after PE has been estimated to be 10%–15% in autopsy series. In the below referenced study, they showed a higher prevalence of 25% for wedge-shaped opacity at CT.  This may reflect differences in the interval between the embolic event and the CT examination. Owing to subsequent resolution of the parenchymal hemorrhage associated with some opacities, a greater number of acute pulmonary infarcts might be detected on CT scans than in autopsy specimens.
