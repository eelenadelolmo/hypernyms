4 hour anterior and lateral images demonstrate enlarged lateral ventricles with communication between ventricles.

24 hour anterior and lateral images demonstrate hydrocephalus without evidence of significant radiotracer localization above the convexities.

48 hour anterior and lateral images demonstrate continued lack of significant radiotracer localization above the convexities.
Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus, NPH
NPH
Hydrocephalus ex vacuo
66 yo M with dementia and a pacemaker.
Since the patient was unable to undergo MRI of the brain for imaging purposes, the neurosurgery team wished to support their diagnosis with cisternogram. This is textbook appearance of communicating hydrocephalus, communication within 4 hours of subarachnoid injection.  There is lack of radiotracer seen above the convexities (no radiotracer seen in the subarachnoid space around the cerebrum and brain stem) at 24 and 48 hours. These findings are virtually pathognomonic for NPH as hydrocephalus ex vacuo would not demonstrate the lack of radiotracer above the convexities.

Nuclear cisternography is typically performed with In-111 DTPA, as is in this case.  It is preferable for NPH diagnosis since its half life is approximately 2.8 days, compared to 6 hours for Tc-99m DTPA, which is often used for similar tests searching for CSF leak or shunt malfunction.
