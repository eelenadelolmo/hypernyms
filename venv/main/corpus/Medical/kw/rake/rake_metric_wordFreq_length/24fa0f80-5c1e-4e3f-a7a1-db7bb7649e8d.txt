Cr 2.4, BUN 5.5 (baseline Cr 1.6, BUN 29)
UA- 26 WBCs/HPF, blood 25/ul, 2+ leukocyte esterase and many bacteria/HPF
The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy with resection of the mass, juxtarenal IVC, right kidney, and right adrenal gland with graft revision of the juxtarenal IVC.  She was discharged without complication on post-operative day 5 with scheduled follow-up.
Abdominal CT with IV contrast reveals a 5x7x8cm retroperitoneal mass at the level of the juxtarenal IVC and right hydronephrosis.  Inferior vena caval venography reveals total IVC occlusion below the renal veins to the retrohepatic region with significant venous collateralization.
Pathology consistent with leiomyosarcoma.
Angiosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, leiomyomatosis, and neurogenic tumor such as paraganglioma
69 y/o African-American female with a history of chronic renal insufficiency and hypertension presented with a 2 month history of worsening low back pain.
Inferior vena cava leiomyosarcoma is a rare tumor representing approximately 0.5% of all adult soft tissue sarcomas.  Presenting symptoms, management, and prognosis are related to tumor location.  Upper IVC leiomyosarcomas occur superior to the hepatic vein, present with Budd-Chiari syndrome, and are the least amenable to resection resulting in the worst prognosis.  Middle IVC leiomyosarcomas occur between the hepatic and renal veins, may present with right upper quadrant pain or renovascular hypertension, and have improved survival.  Lower IVC leiomyosarcomas occur inferior to the renal vein, may present with right lower quadrant, back, or flank pain or lower extremity edema, are the most amenable to complete resection, and have the best prognosis.  5 year survival among all patients has been reported to be 33-53%.
