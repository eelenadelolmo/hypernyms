Texto: 
Chest X-ray as listed. High WBC count. Mild respiratory distress.
Treatment for sepsis  (E. faecium and S. marcescens) predominated. Bronchial lavage revealed no fungal or bacterial organisms. Child expired from multi-system organ failure and sepsis.
CT: at least 2 areas of bilateral lower lung cavitation. 
CXR: suggestion of RML lucency.
Cavitary lung nodule secondary to fungal organism
Vascular emboli
Septic emboli
CCAM
Auto-immune disease (e.g., Wegener's)
3 month old infant brought to ED by mother. Child had had bloody stools over days.
On post-mortem, aspergillosis was isolated, without evidence of fungal invasion. These cavitary nodules may have been secondarily colonized after bacterial septic nodules had necrosed, leaving the pulmonary cavitations.
