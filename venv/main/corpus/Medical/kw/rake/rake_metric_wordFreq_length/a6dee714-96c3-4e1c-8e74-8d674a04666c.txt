No evidence of any syndromal disease or phenotypic abnormality.  Normal external genitalia.  Motor movements appropriate for age
Watchful waiting with UTI chemoprophylaxis.  Neurosurgical intervention planned when patient is slightly older and better able to tolerate surgery.
Axial CT cross-section shows central hypoattenuated circle surrounded by dilated spinal cord.  Reconstituted coronal CT image shows dilated spinal canal at the levels of T7-T11 with well-demarcated central hypoattenuated area, which is isodense to surrounding CSF. Spinal cord extends down to the sacrum  with a second hypoattenuated central structure at the level of the thoracolumbar junction.
  T1 weighted axial MRI shows decreased intensity in the central sac-like area within dilated spinal cord.  This same lesion shows increased intensity on T2 weighted images.  Screening sagittal images show evidence of a tethered cord. There is no Chiari malformation.  There is no evidence of neoplastic process.  FLAIR image shows impressive distension of neurogenic bladder.

A 6 month old female twin with a urinary tract infection secondary to urinary retention.  Pt had normal gestation and birth via Caesarean section.
Syrinxes are often accompanied by other associated abnormalities.  In this case, the infant has a tethered cord, which likely plays a role in the pathogenesis of the syrinx.  Another common abnormality is a Chiari malformation.  The frequent link between a syrinx and other CNS abnormality leads to the advisability of obtaining screening sagittal spine images.
