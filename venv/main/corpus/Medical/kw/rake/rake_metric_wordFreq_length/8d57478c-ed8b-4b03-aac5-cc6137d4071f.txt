Texto: 
Treatment for symptomatic os acromiale includes conservative therapy with ice, rest, and NSAIDs.  If this is not effective ultrasound or electrical stimulation can be used.  This can help to decrease swelling in the subacromial space.  Steroids may reduce pain and increase range of motion.  

Surgical options focus on decompressing the subacromial space.  After surgery only a thin cortical shelf of the acromion is left and this cannot encroach on the rotator cuff.  Removal or fusion of the os acromiale fragments is also indicated.  

Rehabilitation is also needed for the best possible function of the shoulder joint.  In the first few weeks of rehabilitation the goal is to increase range of motion.  The next several weeks continue to concentrate on range of motion and then incorporate strength training.

Bilateral Os Acromiale in a Division I Basketball Player, Davlin, Christina, Fluker, Dave,
Journal of Sports Science and Medicine, 2003, pgs. 175-179
Classic findings of an os acromiale were noted on the shoulder MR. Increased signal is seen in the syndesmosis of the os acromiale that can be associated with symptoms of shoulder pain. Additionally there is increased signal in the supraspinatus muscle and subacromial/subdeltoid bursa.
Os acromiale.
Fractured acromion.
34 year old male who fell off of a three story building and fractured his pelvis and left scapula.  An MRI was performed six months later for persistent shoulder pain.
The patients shoulder pain likely persisted several months after his scapular fracture secondary to impingment type symptoms caused by the os acromiale.
