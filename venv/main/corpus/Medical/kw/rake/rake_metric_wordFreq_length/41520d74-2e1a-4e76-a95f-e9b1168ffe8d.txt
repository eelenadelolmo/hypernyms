In this case, real time ultrasound imaging guiding the biopsy provided the first images suggesting an injury had occurred soon after the initial core sample had been obtained. 

As a result, the injury was quickly recognized and the patient was promptly transported to CT for a non-contrast enhanced study of the kidneys to better delineate the full extent of his injury. During this time, the patient complained in mild to moderate ipsilateral back pain but remained hemodynamically stable. 
 
The patient was admitted to the inpatient ward for close observation. He remained hemodynamically stable and was discharged home the next day with no untoward effects.
Ultrasound initially demonstrates the normal sonographic appearance of the left kidney prior to percutaneous biopsy. Note the normal cortical and medullary differentiation as well as the intact perinephric hyperechoic cortical-capsular interface. 

Ultrasound image selected during the second pass core biopsy (using a spring loaded biopsy needle) demonstrates the course of the biopsy needle.

Ultrasound image captured following the cessation of core biopsy attempts demonstrates complete loss of the previously seen hyperechoic cortical-capsular interface. A wide and slightly irregular perinephric hypoechogenic fluid collection is seen posteriorly (patient prone) most likely representing hematoma. 

Selected axial non-contrast CT slices through the level of the kidneys (taken minutes after the post-biopsy ultrasound) demonstrates left posterior-lateral and inferior perinephric hyperattenuation consistent with acute hemorrhage. The slightly irregular margin of the abnormality suggests this lesion is both subcapsular and perinephric.

Renal Laceration
22 year old male with nephrotic syndrome of undetermined etiology undergoing ultrasound guided percutaneous renal biopsy.
Ultrasound-guided percutaneous renal biopsy using a spring loaded biopsy device is one of the most common methods used for renal biopsy (3). In a review of 1090 normotensive patients without coagulopathy who underwent the procedure between 1993 and 1997 the risk of post-biopsy minor hematoma formation was found to be 2.2% (3). More severe injuries such as loss of a kidney, life threatening hemorrhage, or persisting AV fistula have been reported but are considered exceedingly rare and did not occur in the study cited here. 

Renal injuries are typically classified in one of four radiologic categories (2):

Category I – Cortical Contusion; Subcapsular Hematoma; Minor Laceration with Mild Perinephric Hematoma; or Small Cortical Infarct (2).

Category II – Major Laceration with medullary involvement; Segmental Infarct (2). 

Category III-  Multiple Renal Lacerations; Vascular Pedicle Injury (2).

Category IV-  UPJ Injury (2)

In evaluating a suspected renal injury, CT is the primary modality relied upon to detect and characterize a lesion (2). Using contrast enhanced CT, a renal injury such as a hematoma or laceration can be evaluated and the presence of active hemorrhage or urinary extravasation can frequently be documented (2).

Subcapsular hematomas appear on CT imaging as a crescenteric enlargement surrounding all or a portion of the renal cortex (1). The density of these lesions varies depending upon injury maturity; hyperattenuating in earlier stages and becoming more hypoattenuating with time (1). Slight mass affect on the adjacent renal cortex may also be recognized (1). When the renal capsule is injured whether by blunt trauma or penetrating injury (as in this case by means of a biopsy needle), hematoma can enter the perinephric space (1). Hemorrhage in the perinephric space, when limited, appears similar to the subcapsular hematoma but demonstrates more ragged and heterogeneous margins.   

Most subcapsular hematomas are managed conservatively (1). Only life threatening hemorrhage and impending circulatory collapse will prompt surgical exploration (1). 

This patient was admitted to the hospital over night for close observation, following which he was discharged home with no untoward effects.
