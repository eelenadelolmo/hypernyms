Examination showed swollen left neck.
Afebrile.  Mildly elevated WBC count.
Observation.
Cystic lesion in the posterior left submandibular space. Mass effect is seen on the surrounding structures with lateral and posterior displacement of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. There is subtle mass effect upon the jugular vein. The left submandibular gland is displaced anteriorly and medially by the mass.
Infected 2nd Branchial Cleft Cyst
<li>Branchial cleft cyst
<li>necrotic nodes
<li>cystic neural lesion
<li>thrombosed vessels
Presented to the Emergency Department complaining of an increasingly swollen left neck over the last several days.  Past history of intermittent left neck swelling treated with antibiotics.
Most branchial cleft cysts (90%) are 2nd branchial cleft cysts. This lesion is likely a 2nd branchial cleft cyst based upon its location.
