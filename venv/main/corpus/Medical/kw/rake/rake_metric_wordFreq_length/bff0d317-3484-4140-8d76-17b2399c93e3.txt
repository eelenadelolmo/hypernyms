Assymetry of parotid region
Large, well-defined heterogeneous soft tissue mass within the left parotid gland, inferior to the mastoid process with apparent extension into the mastoid segment of the facial nerve canal.  

There is partial cystic degeneration within the lesion.    There was normal signal in the labyrinthine, tympanic and intracanalicular segments of the facial nerve.
Facial nerve Schwannoma
• Facial nerve Schwannoma
• Perineural spread: Lymphoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma
• Pleomorphic adenoma (High T2 signal)
• Benign lymphoepithelial cysts: Mixed solid and cystic intraparotid lesions (High T2 signal, HIV patients)
• Other parotid masses: Benign mixed tumor, Warthin tumor, Non Hodgkin lymphona, parotid metastasis, mucoepidermoid carcinoma
23 y.o. woman with gradually enlarging left parotid mass.  The patient complained of sharp pain in her left face along with twitching of her left eye, and difficulty hearing out of left ear.
