Texto: 
The patient was in obvious discomfort and experiencing moderate pain in his left eye. The left eye was noted to be proptotic. He had intact extraocular eye movements. Eyesight screening revealed 20/20 vision in his right and left eye. 

Vitals and Labs - within normal limits.
Ophthalmology and plastic surgery coordinated a procedure and performed a left lateral orbitotomy with excision of a large retrobulbar dermoid mass (5 cm x 3 cm x 2 cm). The mass was carefully extracted from the orbit with avoidance of the neural structures and rectus muscles. When seen post operatively in the recovery room the patient had mild edema of the eyelids and was able to see, pupil reaction to light was responsive, and he had intact extraocular eye movements.
A bilobed, ovoid, well-circumscribed, low attenuation mass is demonstrated in the lateral extraconal space of the left orbit. A lobulated portion of the mass extends laterally through a smooth, scalloped defect in the bony orbital wall at the sphenozygomatic suture. An additional component of the mass shows lateral extraorbital extension. No calcifications or abnormal enhancement is seen within the mass or within the margins of the mass. Considerable mass effect is demonstrated on the optic nerve and lateral rectus muscles with both being displaced medially and superiorly. Moderate proptosis is present on the left. The right globe and orbital contents appear normal.
Orbital Retrobulbar Dermoid Cyst
Dermoid or epidermoid tumor 
Orbital abscess 
Retinoblastoma 
Optic nerve glioma 
Cavernous hemangioma
8-year-old boy was hospitalized at age 4 for suspected orbital cellulitis. Since then his eye has slowly and increasingly become more proptotic. Family denied any fever, recent infections, or facial swelling. The patient was complaining of worsening eye pain for two weeks without restricted eye movements or changes in vision, which prompted his mother to bring him in for evaluation.
