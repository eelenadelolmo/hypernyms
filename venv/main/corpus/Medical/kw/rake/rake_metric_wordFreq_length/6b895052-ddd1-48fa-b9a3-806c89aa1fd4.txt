T 98 P 115 BP 122/88 Respiratory rate 18 O2 
Sat 95% on room air

EKG sinus tachy, normal axis.

PT/PTT 35/37
INR 3.5
IVC fiter (Trapease) placement.  Continuation of coumadin (indenfinitely) and IV heparin for 7 days.
Right and left lower extremity DVTs and significant thrombus load within the main, lobar and segmental branches of the right and left pulmonary arteries.
Pulmonary embolism
Causes of hypercoagulability.
Protein C, Protein S, anti-thrombin III deficiency.
Factor V leiden mutation.
Tumor, trauma, surgery, immobility.
Patient with recent diagnosis of right lower extremity DVT 7 days prior to presentation to the ER.  Chief complaint is increased swelling in the right lower extremity, shortness of breath, and chest pain.
At the time of presentation he had been on Lovenox (SQ low molecular weight heparin) and Coumadin for 7 days.
Although the patient was not considered an anitcoagulation treatment failure (he had only been on treatment for 7 days), the thrombus burden within the pulmonary arteries and the size of the bilateral lower extremity thrombi put him at sigficant risk for adverse outcome from subsequent pulmonary embolism.

Indications for IVC Catheters include:
