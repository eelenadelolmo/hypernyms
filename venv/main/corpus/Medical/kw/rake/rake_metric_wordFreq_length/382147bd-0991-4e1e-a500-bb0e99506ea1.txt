Texto: 
Pelvic exam demonstrated no palpable mass or cervical motion tenderness.  Patient had a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding.

HCG:  Positive.

HCG, QUANTITATIVE:  4821 mIU/mL

WBC: 4.7 TH/CU. mm
Hgb: 12.7 G/dL
Hct: 38.8 %
Platelets: 333 TH/Cu. mm
Patient was evaluated by Gynecology.  She was subsequently treated with methotrexate.
Gray scale sonographic images of the pelvis demonstrates a homogeneous endometrial stripe without visualization of a gestational sac.  A 1.3x1.5x14 cm right adnexal mass with a peripheral rim of increased echogenicity and peripheral hyperemia is demonstrated.  This mass is not contiguous with the right ovary.  Complex fluid is demonstrated in the cul de sac.

31 year old woman with vaginal bleeding and history of bilateral tubal ligation presents to the emergency room.
In the setting of a patient with a history of a bilateral tubal ligation and a positive HCG, the likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy was high.  

Patient’s quantitative HCG was greater than 1,500 mIU/mL where a gestational sac should have been demonstrated by endovaginal ultrasound.  The patient demonstrated the a peripherally hyperechoic mass in the right adnexa with the classic “ring of fire”  sign.  Additionally, the echogenic fluid in the cul de sac was present.  The constellation of clinical history, lab, and sonographic findings were strong for the diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy.
