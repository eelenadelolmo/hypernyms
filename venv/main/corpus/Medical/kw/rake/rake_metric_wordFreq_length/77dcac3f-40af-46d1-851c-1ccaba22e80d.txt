PET:
BRAIN:  Tomographic images of the brain, following the intravenous administration of F-18 FDG, demonstrate decreased glucose metabolism
within the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes, much more significant on the left than the right.  This is only mild within the right frontal lobe,
moderate within the right parietal lobe and mild within the right temporal
lobe.  Decreased activity within the left frontal lobe is moderate, with
severely decreased metabolism within the left parietal lobe and moderately
decreased activity within the left temporal lobe.  There is preservation of motor cortex and cerebellar activity (seen on saggital and coronal images not displayed here), as well as basal ganglia activity.
Alzheimer's disease (FDG PET pattern, and history)
Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, Pick's Disease, Multi-infarct dementia
73 year old female with dementia.
Alzheimer&#8217;s disease is a common cause of dementia.  Nuclear medicine imaging modalities include SPECT and PET which demonstrate high predictive values in the assessment for AD. SPECT imaging utilizes Tc 99m HMPAO or ECD.  This is considered a cerebral perfusion agent and will show reduced activity in areas of neuron depletion, which, in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease are classically the posterior temporal and parietal lobes, with normal tracer accumulation in the motor cortex.  PET (FDG-F18) fluorodeoxyglucose, a glucose analogue, will typically demonstrate this same accumulation pattern as the above noted SPECT agents in patients with AD.  Decreased accumulation in AD may also involve the frontal lobes (but not exclusively)  

Pick&#8217;s disease, on the other hand, typically demonstrates "hypofrontality" with preservation of activity in the remainder of the brain.

Multi-Infarct dementia will demonstrate multiple focal defects throughout the brain.
