There is a 7.5 x 6.9 cm frontal parafalcine, homogeneously and intensely enhancing mass at the level of the olfactory groove. There is significant mass effect on the frontal lobes and associated peritumoral vasogenic edema. There is an expected CSF cleft around the mass consistent with its extraaxial location.
