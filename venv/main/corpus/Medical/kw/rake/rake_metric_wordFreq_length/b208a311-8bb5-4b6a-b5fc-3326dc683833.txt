Â» Vitals: Hypotensive with tachycardia.
Â» General: Patient appears toxic and in pain.  
Â» Neck: Cervical Crepitus. Cardiovascular: Sinus tachycardia, positive Hamman crunch, heart sounds obscured by crepitus.
Â» Respiratory: Anterior mediastinal crepitus. Coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
Â» Abdomen: firm, distended, tender to palpation. 
Â» Laboratory results: metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis and elevated lactate.
The patient was fluid resuscitated, intubated, and sedated on a propofol drip as well as on a Neo-Synephrine drip (for his refractory hypotension). After being examined in the emergency department and after his films were reviewed, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room for primary repair of his esophageal perforation.  After surgical repair, three chest tubes were placed in order to drain the area around the rupture. The patient was placed on broad spectrum antibiotic therapy and was sent to the surgical ICU for recovery.
Â» CXR: lucencies projecting over the neck along the left border of the heart consistent with pneumomediastinum. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Small left pleural effusion present.

Â» CT chest: subcutaneous air in the neck. Pneumomediastinum present with opacity at left lung base consistent with pleural effusion. Opacity also seen in the right lung base.
Boerhaave's syndrome (esophageal rupture)
myocardial infarction, pericarditis, spontaneous pneumothorax, aortic dissection, aortic aneurysm, pulmonary embolus, pneumonia, and perforated viscous.
This 75 y.o. man presents with acute episode of abdominal pain after repeated bouts of emesis that gradually became bloody.
Boerhaave's syndrome is esophageal rupture, often caused by multiple episodes of violent vomiting.  PMID: 18936020 Early diagnosis and treatment is critical for survival.  PMID: 1267496  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1344212/pdf/annsurg00278-0083.pdf

Imaging findings include pneumomediastinum, pnemothorax, pleural fluid, and subcutaneous emphysema.  PMID: 18936020,  PMID: 21175816, PMID: 9196697

A review from 2009 PMID: 19145081 showed good outcomes from early endoscopic management, as well as sugical intervention.
