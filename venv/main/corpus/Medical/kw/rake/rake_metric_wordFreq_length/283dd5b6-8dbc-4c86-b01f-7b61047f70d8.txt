The physical examination was significant only for right knee and left wrist swelling and tenderness.  Significantly, a thorough neurological examination was completely normal.

Laboratory studies performed upon admission were completely normal.  Per the emergency department trauma protocol, the patient received a CT scan of the head and neck. Plain films of the right knee and left wrist were also performed.  The conventional radiographs of the right knee revealed a tibial plateau fracture and an associated lipohemarthrosis.  A CT of the abdomen was not performed.  After the emergency department received a wet read of the CT of the neck a conventional angiogram of the carotid arteries was requested and performed.
Anecdotes suggest that stentings of such lesions lead to unfavorable outcomes. 

This patientâ€™s bilateral ICA dissections proved to be non-flow-limiting and completely asymptomatic.  The patient was prescribed aspirin, clopidogrel, and follow up imaging at regular intervals.
There is marked asymmetry of the size of the internal carotid arteries.  The lumen of the left is much larger than the right.  Both arteries exhibit irregular areas of ectasia and stricture.   Intimal flaps are seen in portions of the arteries bilaterally, evidencing bilateral ICA dissection.

The patient is a 50 year old asian woman status post motor vehicle accident.  Upon arrival to the ER she was alert and physiologically stable.  Her only complaints were right knee and left wrist pain.
The MVA was estimated by an officer of the law to have occurred at a moderate velocity, perhaps 40 mph.    

Bilateral ICA dissection was diagnosed by CT.  The patient's only other injury was a non-displaced right tibial plateau fracture.  Due to the absence of other serious injuries and the ICA asymmetry, a predisposing angiopathy was suspected.   The presence of Fibromuscular Dysplasia was confirmed with conventional angiography.
