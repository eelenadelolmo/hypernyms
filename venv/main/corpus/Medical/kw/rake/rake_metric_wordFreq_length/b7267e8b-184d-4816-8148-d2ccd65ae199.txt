Patient will undergo survellience imaging to follow lesion size.  Imaging will include ultrasound, as she is in chronic renal insufficiency from her DM and actually went into acute renal failure following the current CT exam with contrast.
On ultrasound, there is a well-circumscribed, partially exophytic, uniformly hyperechoic mass measuring approximately 1.8cm.  There is no visualized internal blood flow on the doppler image.

On CT, this well-circumscribed mass is hetergenously hypodense with respect to renal parenchyma.  There is macroscopic fat and mildly enhancing internal soft tissue components.  No calcification.
Angiomyolipoma (sporadic), Cholelithiasis
Angiomyolipoma
Renal cell carcinoma (especially clear-cell variant)
Renal lipoma
Metastatic disease
68 y.o. woman with DM type 2, on metformin; with proteinuria.
Although the given lesion has a morphology and density characteristics diagnostic of AML, there are case reports in the literature of cystic/clear cell renal carcinomas having a similar appearance.  Further reassuring is the lack of calcification.  These lesions should be followed, as they can hemorrhage when large.  The AML is a hamartomatous lesion, considered ostensibly benign although sarcomatous degeneration has rarely been known to occur.  In the vast majority of cases, however, a renal lesion (partially exophytic 25% of the time) containing macroscopic fat, HU < -60, and internal soft tissue components is an AML until proven otherwise.  There is a 15% association with Tuberous Sclerosis.
