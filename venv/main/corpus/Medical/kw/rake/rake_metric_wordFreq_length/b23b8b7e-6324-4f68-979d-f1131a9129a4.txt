Right sided proptosis, otherwise WNL
This patient has been treated with chemotherapy since August 2004 due to the proptosis caused by the mass. Chemotherapy agents include carboplatin and vincristine. Thus far the mass has had a minimal decrease in size.
Right sided intraconal solid spherical mass continuous with the optic nerve. Meninges appear to be intact around mass with CSF surrounding mass. Mass appears to be confined within orbit and does not involve the optic chiasm. The signal intensity of the mass in T1W images is similar to the signal intensity of the optic nerves and brain matter. On T2W images, the mass again has similar intensity to the optic nerves and brain matter and has a higher intensity than the musculature. On T1W images, post-gadolinium, the mass shows fairly uniform contrast enhancement
Optic Nerve Glioma
Most Common Orbital Malignancies of Children:
Rhabdomyosarcoma (Primary)
Neuroblastoma (usually metastatic)
Retinoblastoma (intraocular)
Most Common Orbital Masses:
Benign cysts (Teratoma, dermoid, epidermoid, congenital cystic eye)
Vascular lesions (capillary hemangioma, cavernous hemangioma, AVM, lymphangioma)
Neurogenic Orbital Masses of Children:
Optic nerve glioma
Optic sheath meningioma
Sphenoid wing meningioma
Schwannoma
Neurofibroma
Less Common Considerations:
Langerhans’ Cell Histiocytosis
Lacrimal gland lesions (cysts, tumors)
Inflammatory process or infection
2 y.o. noted to have right sided proptosis
The pediatric patient presenting with proptosis should always make the clinician think of rhabdomyosarcoma. Although this tumor accounts for only about 10% of all orbital tumors, it is the most common primary malignancy of the orbit and is rapidly progressive and destructive. For this reason, children with proptosis, decreased vision, or ptosis should promptly be imaged with either CT or MRI (CT is better to evaluate for bony invasion of rhabdomyosarcoma) to evaluate for a mass suspicious for rhabdomyosarcoma. Other masses in the differential include orbital cysts (which are the most common orbital mass and generally benign), vascular lesions, neurogenic tumors as listed above, and metastatic disease (of which, neuroblastoma is the most common malignancy to metastasize to the orbit). Cysts of the orbit are by far the most common, with dermoid and epidermoid cysts accounting for about 30-46% of all orbital masses; vascular lesions account for about 15%; neurogenic tumors and metastatic tumors both account for about 2-3% each.

This patient had an MRI series of the orbits done, revealing a retrobulbar mass and the findings listed above. With the mass continuous with the optic nerve and encapsulated by the optic nerve sheath, it makes the diagnosis of an optic nerve tumor much more likely than the other possible diagnoses in the differential. As the mass has meninges smoothly lining it and there is CSF visualized between the mass and the dura, the mass is most likely a part of the optic nerve—leading to the diagnosis of optic nerve glioma.

An optic nerve glioma is actually a juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma of the optic nerve, which is a benign and usually slow growing tumor. ONG accounts for about 20% of neurogenic tumors in the orbit, there is possibly a mild predilection for females, and it usually presents by 8 years of age. The presenting signs and symptoms are typically slow progressing painless proptosis, visual loss, nystagmus, strabismus, and optic atrophy or edema. About 29% of cases are associated with Neurofibromatosis Type I—typically presenting with bilateral optic nerve gliomas. At the time of diagnosis, about 25-30% of gliomas involve only the intraorbital optic nerve, about 60-70% of gliomas involve the chiasm, of which about 40% have invaded surrounding structures. 

Management of optic nerve gliomas is typically conservative, involving regular interval physical exams and MRI imaging to evaluate for changes in size (physical exam every 6 months and MRI every 1 year). This is because ONGs are benign, slow growing tumors, and in up to 80% of cases, vision does decline some but then remains stable. Surgical and radiologic intervention result in loss of vision and are usually only offered if vision loss or proptosis progresses, or the tumor begins invading the chiasm or hypothalamus. Chemotherapy is also available and is becoming a more popular form of treatment, as it can avoid the possible complete loss of vision and neurotoxic effects of surgery and radiation. Chemotherapy drugs being used include carboplatin and vincristine, and several studies have recommended that chemotherapy with these drugs be first-line treatment for optic nerve gliomas that involve the chiasm and/or hypothalamus.
