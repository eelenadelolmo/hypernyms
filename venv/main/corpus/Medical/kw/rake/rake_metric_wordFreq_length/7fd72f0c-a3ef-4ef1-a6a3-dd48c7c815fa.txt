Temp: 37.6 C   P90   R18   BP153/67.  Discomfort is evident, but the patient is in no acute distress.  She has dry mucous membranes.  The cardiovascular exam is regular in rate and rhythm, with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  She has good air entry, but with decreased breath sounds at bases.  There is 2+ edema and warmth in the knees bilaterally.

The left 1st MTP joint and right elbow are warm and red.  The right index finger PIP and DIP joints are edematous, warm, and red. There is markedly decreased strength in all extremities, especially grip strength bilaterally.  

Laboratory studies revealed WBC 17.7, BUN 69, Cr 2.2 (her baseline was 1.6), uric acid 10.4, and ESR 24.
This patient was continued on her current regimen of colchicine and allopurinol, along with aggressive rehydration and therapeutic joint aspirations of the knees bilaterally. Blood, urine, and fluid cultures were negative for bacteria.  She was discharged after 4 days and seen in follow-up by her primary care manager.

She also has an extensive surgical history that includes left nephrectomy/ureterectomy, left breast lumpectomy with nodes, right total hip arthroplasty, right total knee arthroplasty.  Her medication list is long and includes Synthroid 112mcg, Demadex 20mg, colchicine 0.6mg, allopurinol (started 1 month ago) 300 mg, Evista 60mg, prednisone 5mg (stopped 2 weeks ago), Coreg 12.5mg, and Metolazone 5mg.
A series of images revealed punched out erosions in the left foot, 1st metatarsal and MTP joint, and 5th TMT joint; right foot, 5th proximal phalanx, and MTP joint; left hand 1st metacarpal, and 2nd proximal phalanx and MCP joint; and tophi in the left knee joint and even in the superior patellar tendon.
Polyarticular gout
Considering this patient's extensive medical and surgical history, the differential diagnosis is long and includes:

‚Ä¢ Diffuse metastasis
‚Ä¢ Osteoarthritis 
‚Ä¢ Rheumatoid arthritis
‚Ä¢ Gouty arthritis
‚Ä¢ Septic arthritis
This 71 y.o. woman presented to the Emergency Department with a one week history of pain that began in her left foot, then involved both feet, then began to progressively ascend her lower extremities until finally involving her entire body in ‚Äú10+ / 10‚Äù pain on the day of presentation.  This generalized body pain is described as a deep ache, and not relieved with Tylenol.  It is associated with nausea, but no vomiting.  The most painful joint is the right sternoclavicular joint.  Prior to the pain starting, the patient reports a fever of 3 days duration. Until about three days ago, the patient was walking with her cane, then her walker, until this morning when she couldn‚Äôt even stand.

The patient‚Äôs medical history is remarkable for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (maybe), congestive heart failure, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, chronic renal insufficiency, left renal carcinoma, and left breast carcinoma.
Although gout is sometimes considered a disease of middle-aged men with an alcoholic history, this patient had a number of conditions that predisposed her to monosodium urate crystal deposition disease (gout).  She has a long history of chronic renal insufficiency, resulting from left nephrectomy and ureterectomy necessitated by renal cancer.  She also has a history of breast cancer and treatment with cyclosporine.  Furthermore, the patient was a widow who was malnourished and chronically dehydrated.  The gout was undoubtedly present for many years, as the development of tophi usually occurs 5-8 years after the onset of the fist gouty attack.  The patient may or may not have sought treatment for the first several attacks, especially if they were intermittent, because she does have a long history of osteoarthritis.
