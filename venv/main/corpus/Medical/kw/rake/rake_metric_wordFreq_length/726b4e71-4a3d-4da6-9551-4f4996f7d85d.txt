Unconscious with multiple extremity, thoracic and jaw/neck injuries.
Surgery, amputions and rehab.
SKULL/C-SPINE: AP and Lateral demonstrate complex mandible fracture and extensive soft tissue swelling in the neck region. No fracture of the skull is seen. There is no obvious fracture or dislocation of the cervical spine but there is apparent prevertebral soft tissue swelling. CT of c-spine recommended. 

CHEST: AP demonstrates fracture of the right clavicle and the right 5th and 6th ribs. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are seen. There is mediastinal shift to the right with volume loss and opacity in the right lung base and the right upper thorax, concerning for collapse of the RLL and RUL. There is an air fluid level noted on the lateral in the right base concerning for a hemo-pneumothorax. ABDOMEN: No spinal fractures seen but CT needed to confirm. There is a metallic foreign body seen in the left flank soft tissues consistent with previous gunshot. Cannot evaluate for free air on supine views. 

EXTREMITIES: There is a mildly angulated and displaced fracture of the right forearm. There is a displaced and angulated fracture of the right femur. The patient has bilateral, right worse than left, severely comminuted tib-fib fractures. The patient still has his boots on and the right foot appears to be completely severed with the left only partially attached with soft tissues.

32 year old construction worker was involved in a mishap after a crane had toppled over.  The man was struck in the legs by a large support cable that had suddenly became taut while the crane was falling.
The Statscan proved extemely valuable in a very quick overview which guided primary life saving treatments as well it focused and guided the confirmatory  radiographic and CT examinations.
