Texto: 
Scoliosis
Bilateral anterior and lateral bowing of legs
Delayed dentition
Oral supplementation of vitamin D, also calcium and phosphorous
F/U radiographs to monitor healing, zone of subperiosteal bone formation
Long-term f/u for complications of short stature, pelvic deformities, abnormal gait
Cupping and fraying of the metaphyseal region at the distal end of the radius and ulna, due to lack of mineralization of cartilage at the growth plate
Vitamin D deficient rickets
Deficiency of vitamin D metabolites causes decreased mineralization at growth plates
UV light stimulates vitamin D formation in the skin
Risk factors: dietary deficiency, living in the inner city (smog), darkly pigmented skin, decreased UV penetration
Rickets (deficiency of calcium, phosphorous, or vitamin D)
Congenital epiphyseal dysplasia
Metaphyseal chondroplasia
Mesenchymal bone or connective tissue tumor (nonossifying fibroma)
3 yo AA female from the inner city, presents with irritability, apathy, height and weight below 3rd percentile
