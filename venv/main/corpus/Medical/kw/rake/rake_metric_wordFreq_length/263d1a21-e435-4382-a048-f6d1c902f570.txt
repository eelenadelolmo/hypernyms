Deglutition demonstrated penetration without aspiration of contrast material.  Dilated esophagus with almost beak-like narrowing, as well as an almost complete absence of primary peristalsis in the thoracic esophagus.  Rapid transit of contrast through the GEJ was observed, and the 13mm barium tablet passed easily. Findings not changed from exam of 2 years ago.
    Normal transit and peristalsis through stomach, duodenum.
Presbyesophagus/nonspecific esophageal motility disorder
achalasia, scleroderma, post-surgical changes
chronic cough, history of pneumonectomy for mesothelioma with recent CT showing no evidence of metastatic disease
Physical exam, multiple chest-abdomen-pelvis CT's with no evidence of scleroderma.  LES relaxes with swallowing and easily passes 13mm tablet, eliminating achalasia.
