There is a focus of increased radiotracer activity in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast (or axillary tail of Spence), consistent with breast carcinoma.  Another area of asymmetric, only slightly increased activity, is visualized more inferiorly in the left breast, of uncertain significance, but is somewhat concerning.  There is no evidence of distant mestastasis.
Infiltrating ductal carcinoma
Invasive ductal carcinoma
Intraductal carcinoma in-situ
Invasive lobular carcinoma
72 year old female with newly diagnosed left breast cancer.
The PET scan (positron emission tomography) has recently come to the forefront in the assessment of breast cancer because of its superior accuracy in the staging of distant metastases, and its utility in assessing response to chemotherapy.  This case displays the PET appearance of pathologically proven infiltrating ductal carcinoma.
