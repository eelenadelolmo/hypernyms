Slowly mentating gentleman with pus in urine.  Uncontrolled diabetic.  WBC=18
Right nephrectomy.  Patient died within 1wk.
There is gas within the right renal parenchyma on the non contrast CT examination.  In the inferior aspect of the kidney there is a perinephric gas collection, which represents perinephric renal abscess.  The CT scout and plain films of the abdomen do not definitively show the air collection, though in hindsight there does appear to be a striated gas collection.
Emphysematous pyelonephritis
Emphysematous pyelonephritis.  This is an Aunt Minnie.
Suspected urosepsis in a diabetic.
This is a case of emphysematous pyelonephritis as well as an infrarenal abscess.  This process is predominantly confined to diabetics, or immunocompromised patients.  It has an approximate 50% mortality.  This particular patient did have a nephrectomy, but expired within a week despite therapy.  Other treatments may include percutaneous drainage.  Which, was probably not an option in this case.
