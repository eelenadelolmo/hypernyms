Surgical resection of meningioma.  No treatment for the cavernous malformations.
• CT calcified mass right basal ganglia and a hemispheric convexity mass almost isodense with brain

• MRI  Large right basal ganglionic/temporal  heterogeneous black-and-white mass lesion with remarkably little mass effect.  A similar but smaller lesion is seen in the base of left frontal lobe.  There is a right frontal convexity extraaxial lesion, hemispheric, with an enhancing "dural tail".
Cavernous  hemangioma and Convexity Meningioma
1) Meningioma
2) Multiple cerebral cavernous malformations
42 year old woman who had CT scan at outside hospital because of headache.  MRI obtained 2 month later for further evaluation
