48 year old female presents for Computed Tomography after notifying her primary care provider that years earlier she was told she had a nodule in her lung on chest x-ray.

Surgical History: 
Cholecystectomy at age 35
Hysterectomy at age 43 (for fibroids)
Benign Metastasizing Leiomyoma is an extremely rare disorder, occuring almost exclusively in women (20+ years of age), most of whom have a history of uterine leiomyoma resection or hysterecomy due to large leimyomata. Lesions which metastasize to the lung may be solitary or multiple, appear as well circumscribed rounded lesions, and cannot be distinguished from other causes of pulmonary nodules without tissue sampling. 

Patients are usually asymptomatic. Lesions behave as slow growing benign tumors but some reports refer to them as a low grade sarcoma, particularly when found in children. Lesions are generally quite hormone sensitive, though again less so in children.
