Exam revealed right midfoot soft tissue swelling and significant tenderness to palpation over the right tarsal-metatarsal joints.
Injuries of the Lisfranc joint complex may be treated operatively or non-operatively, depending on the severity of injury and the practice preferences of the treating physician. The criteria for determining surgical versus non-surgical treatment remains somewhat controversial.  The temporal importance of soft-tissue swelling in altering the degree of bony diastasis is often debated. 

Non-operative treatment typically consists of immobilization with a non-weight-bearing cast, a short-leg walking cast, or removable orthotic, for a period of four to six weeks, or until resolution of symptoms.

Surgical fixation may be open or closed, again depending on the preferences of the treating Orthopod.  Closed fixation is accomplished with percutaneous Kirshner wires.  Open reduction and internal fixation may result in a superior degree of immobilization.  Arbeitsgemeinschaft f?r Osteosynthesefragen (AO) screws are commonly utilized for this purpose, and are generally left in place for 12 weeks.  During this time period the foot is further immobilized with a cast, and weight-bearing is restricted.  Following removal of the AO screws, the cast is removed and weight-bearing is gradually advanced. A protective shoe and orthotic should be worn for several months after cast removal.
Plain film of the right foot demonstrated subtle widening of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. 

Bone scan revealed focally increased uptake in the right 1st and 2nd tarsal-metatarsal joints as well as hyperemia of the entire right foot.  Additionally, there is increased uptake in the head of the right 5th metatarsal, the right tibial sesamoid bone, the head of the right 2nd metatarsal, and the tuberosity of the right 5th metatarsal, consistent with stress reactive change.
Lisfranc Fracture-Dislocation. Diagnosis is based on bone scan and plain film findings, clinical history, and physical examination.
Lisfranc fracture-dislocation
23 year-old active duty soldier sustained an injury to his right foot while marching, which occurred one month prior to presentation for a bone scan.  Patient stated that he stumbled when his right forefoot landed in a depression.
In this case, the initial plain film of the foot was interpreted as normal.  Weight-bearing radiographs were not obtained.  Due to persistent symptoms, the patient was referred to nuclear medicine for bone scintigraphy.  In addition to intensely increased uptake at the 1st and 2nd tarsal-metatarsal joints, there is diffusely increased uptake throughout the right foot, consistent with hyperemia.  These findings, in conjunction with clinical history and physical exam, are consistent with the diagnosis of a Lisfranc Fracture-Dislocation.
