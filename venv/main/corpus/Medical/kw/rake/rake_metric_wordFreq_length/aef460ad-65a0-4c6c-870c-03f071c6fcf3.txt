Vitals: BP 98/59, pulse 104, temp 36.8C, resp rate 28, height 105cm, weight 17kg
General: awake, alert, cooperative with exam, no acute distress
Head: diffuse seborrheic dermatitis, 3.5x4cm scabbed lesion on L frontal scalp
Ears: tympanic membranes obstructed bilaterally by purulent fluid in external canals
Abdomen: distended, hepatomegaly, hyperactive bowel sounds
Neuro: no focal deficits, CN 2-12 grossly intact, reflexes 2+ bilaterally
Remainder of physical exam reassuring and without abnormalities

Concurrent diabetes insipidus treated with vasopressin and followed by endocrinology
Vinblastine, prednisone managed by hematology/oncology
Close follow-up with neurosurgery given location of lesion
XR skull: “Punched out” lytic lesions involving left parietal and temporal bones
CT head: Large lytic lesion involving left parietal, temporal, occipital, and greater wing of sphenoid bone. Significant bony destruction involving temporal bone with soft tissue extension into the external auditory canal, middle ear cavity, left parapharyngeal fat, and lateral pterygoid and temporalis musculature. Second (1cm) lytic lesion in the right mastoid sinus with erosion of the anterior and inferior wall and extension into the right external auditory canal. 
MR brain: Extensive enhancing soft tissue mass with bone destruction throughout left temporal bone with extension to occipital and sphenoid bones. Additional erosion of left mandibular condyle and right mastoid sinus. Enhancing mass present at the infundibulum. Disease extension into the upper neck surrounding, but not narrowing the internal carotid artery. 
US Abdomen: Borderline hepatomegaly, no intra-abdominal mass identified. Bilateral extrarenal pelvises without caliectasis. Kidneys otherwise normal in appearance. 
XR Abdomen: Prominent hepatic shadow. 
XR Chest: No acute pulmonary consolidation. 
CT Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis: Normal study. 
Nuclear Bone Scan: Solitary lesion in left temporoparietal cavarium. No additional skeletal abnormality.

4 year old male with history of non-healing lesion on scalp for approximately 12 months along with seborrheic changes of scalp. Lesions were not responsive to griseofulvin or hydrocortisone creams. Concurrent history of polydipsia, polyuria, and purulent drainage from bilateral external auditory canals.
In this case, the patient is near the age range (5-10 years old) typically associated with Eosinophilic Granuloma (Langerhans cell histiocytosis). Secondary to intracranial tumor extension, this patient was treated for concurrent diabetes insipidus with vasopressin. With clinically demonstrated CNS involvement, there is increased risk for this patient to develop additional CNS complications. Due to temporal bone involvement, potential for otitis media refractory to antibiotic treatment and hearing loss in the left ear.
