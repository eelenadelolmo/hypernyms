Surgical treatment is performed for symptomatic patients.
Axial CT images of the chest performed with contrast show a vascular structure lateral to the aortic arch on the left.  The structure is continuous with the pulmonary veins draining the left upper lobe.
Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (PAPVR)
• Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return from the left upper lobe.
• Left sided superior vena cava (differentiated by following course of the vein)

PAPVR represents a left-to-right shunt.   When the shunt is large (i.e. Qp/Qs ratio greater than 1.5), patients typically present with shortness of breath.
