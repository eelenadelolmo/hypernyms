Chem 7 reveals no electrolyte abnormalities and normal renal function.
For asymptomatic patients with small (<4cm), single/few masses, no further follow-up required.  For questionable or symptomatic masses, follow-up with US or tumor resection may be prudent.  A few patients who present with hemorrhage may be a surgical emergency (1).  If the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis is considered (present at younger age, multiple/large/bilateral tumors, symptomatic), may need to further screen with skin, opthalmologic, neurologic examinations, and brain MRI (2).
Axial CT of the abdomen demonstrates solitary 1cm mass in right kidney, with an attenuation of -20 Hounsfield units.
Angiomyolipoma
Renal cell carcinoma, Teratoma, Oncocytoma, Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, Wilms tumor, Liposarcoma, Angiomyolipoma. (1)
68-year-old female with a 30-pack-year smoking history, presents with cough and nose bleed.  CXR reveals a nodular density, which further evaluated with chest CT.  Chest CT has incidental finding of possible hepatic vascular malformation.  Abdominal ultrasound is recommended to evaluate liver findings.  During abdominal ultrasound, four echogenic masses are noted in the right kidney.  Further evaluation of renal masses with abdominal CT is then recommended.
Benign tumors.  Majority are small and single.  Composed of fat, vascular and smooth muscle tissues.  Majority of cases are asymptomatic, but may present with flank pain, palpable mass, hematuria, altered renal function, or spontaneous hemorrhage.  Incidence in the US between 0.3-3%.  More common in females (4:1).  80% of cases involve the right kidney.  Associated with tuberous sclerosis in 20% of cases (lesions are usually multiple, larger, and bilateral).  80% of patients with tuberous sclerosis have angiomyolipomas. (2)
