Patient's physical exam and laboratory work are unremarkable.
Patient is being treated with beta interferon .
There are multiple white matter lesions which are  hyperintense on long TR sequences.  The lesions are best appreciated on the FLAIR sequences.  These lesions are in a periventricular distribution and are round and oval in appearance. This distribution and appearance has been termed  ‚ÄúDawson‚Äôs fingers‚Äù, and is believed to reflect the perivenular location of many MS plaques which surround veins perpendicular to and draining into the subependymal venous plexus on the inner surface of the ventricle.
 MS plaques are generally isointense or, with older lesions, hypointense on T1W sequences.  A single plaque within the left frontoparietal region demonstrates enhancement, which correlates with disruption of the blood brain barrier and suggests active demyelination.  On sagittal imaging, lesions are seen to involve the callosal-septal interface.

52-year old female with known history of multiple sclerosis complains of gradual worsening gait and balance.
Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease with several subtypes most commonly characterized by a chronic, relapsing course.  It is classicaly defined as a disease with multiple central nervous system lesions ‚Äúseparated in time and space‚Äù.   The most common sites of involvement are the deep white matter tracts of the centrum semiovale, the undersurface of the corpus callosum, corona radiata, and brain stem, particularily the middle cerebellar peduncles.  They are classically in a periventricular distribution as seen in this case.  Many diseases can produce such lesions.  Therefore, the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is based on combination of imaging features, such as those seen here, physical exam and laboratory results.  The laboratory abnormalities often include oligoclonal bands in CSF.
