Texto: 
The patient aspirated some barium during the barium swallow.
Medical therapy: No medical treatment is currently known or practiced for symptomatic Zenker diverticulum.

Surgical therapy: Small, asymptomatic diverticula require no specific therapy. For all others, surgical treatment is the preferred therapy. The 2 key elements of the successful surgical management of this disease are division of the cricopharyngeus muscle and elimination of the diverticular pouch as a reservoir of food and secretions.


Treatment of Zenker diverticulum traditionally has been surgical. Surgical options include diverticulectomy with cricopharyngeal myotomy, diverticular suspension (diverticulopexy) with cricopharyngeal myotomy, and cricopharyngeal myotomy alone.
Barium Swallow under fluoroscopy reveals.
>>Barium-filled saccular structure in the midline below level of hypopharynx on frontal projection on.
>>On the lateral view â€“ barium filled collection behind the posterior wall of the pharnyngoesophageal segment and proximal cervical esophagus.
Zenker's Diverticulum
These findings are pathogonomic for Zenker's Diverticulum as other divertular pathology (i.e mid esophageal and epiphrenic diverticula)do not present midline and posteriorly.
86 yo male with progressive solid food dysphagia x 4 months.
History of recent episodic aspiration.
2 year history of halitosis.
4-5 year history of GERD.
This patient was referred back to the GI Clinic for referral for cricopharyngeal myotomy secondary to increased regurgitation of undigested food, aspiration, and halitosis.
