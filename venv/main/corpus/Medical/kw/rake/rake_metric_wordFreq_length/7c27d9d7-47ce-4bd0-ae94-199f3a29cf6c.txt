Texto: 
KNEE: Tender to palpation over both medial and lateral joint lines.  Diffuse soft tissue edema.
Patient was referred to orthopedics.
â€¢ Plain radiographs of the knee do not reveal a fracture lucency or step-off at the articular surface. 

â€¢ There is joint effusion present.

â€¢ MR images through the knee reveal diffuse edema throughout the tibial with low signal extending to the articular surface consistent with a comminuted tibial plateau fracture.
Tibial Plateau Fracture
None
24 year old man  with knee pain after a fall.
This case demonstrates how such fractures may be radiographically occult - yet evident on MRI.
