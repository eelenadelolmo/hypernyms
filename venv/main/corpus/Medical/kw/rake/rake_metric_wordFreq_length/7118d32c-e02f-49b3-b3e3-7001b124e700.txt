Texto: 
tender on the right, no significant edema, no constitutional symptoms, no palpable mass
treated conservatively, with angalgesics
Testicular ultrasound demonstrates normal symmetric echogenicity of the testicles, and there is normal color flow on both sides.  There is a hydrocele on the right, and the appendix testes is conspicuous as a small projection of tissue in the notch between the head of the epididymis and testicle.  The patient was particularly tender when scanned over this area.
