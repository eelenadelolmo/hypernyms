The liver metastasis confirms the cancer as a Stage IV non-resectable cancer. Palliative chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be considered.
CECT demonstrates:
1. Two  masses in left lower lobe. The larger mass is approx. 4cm in diameter,  with a lobulated and spiculated margin. 
2. 3.7 cm mass in the right posterior lobe of the liver with a vaguely enhancing margin and hypodense necrotic center. 

Ultra-sound guided needle biopsy of the liver lesion images demonstrate a complex mass in the right posterior lobe of the liver, superior to the right kidney. One of the images demonstrates the biopsy needle in place at the periphery of the lesion.
Bronchogenic Carcinoma  with Metastasis to the Liver. 
Diagnosis confirmed by US guided needle biopsy of the liver lesion and cytopathologic study of the recovered tissue.
Differential for the liver lesion (on ultrasound)

<li> Metastatic lung cancer
<li> Cavernous hemangioma
<li> Pyogenic abscess
<li> Hepatocellular carcinoma
<li> Fibrolamellar carcinoma
<li> Hepatic adenoma
76 year old man with known primary lung cancer referred to radiology for 3 phase contrast enhanced abdominal CT to clarify liver lesion noted on prior study.
