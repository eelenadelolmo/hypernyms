Multiple MRI images, to include FLAIR, T1 pre-gadolinium, T1 post-gadolinium, and T2 FSE pulse sequences show a large partially "cystic" mass in the left parietal lobe which contains a moderately sized solid mural nodule.  The mural nodule shows contrast enhancement.  No significant surrounding edema is present.  There is mass effect on the posterior horn of the left lateral ventricle.
