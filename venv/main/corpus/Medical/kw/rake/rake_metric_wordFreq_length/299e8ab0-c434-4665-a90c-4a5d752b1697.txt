Texto: 
4 centimeter tender fluctuant lesion to the left of midilne in the lower thoracic region. 

Lab:  Infected epidermal inclusion cyst
Excisional Biopsy
Precontrast sagittal sequences demonstrate a well circumscribed lesion in the subcutaneous tissue without involving the underlying fascia or extension into paravertebral musculature that has low signal intensity on T1WI, and high central signal intensity on T2WI.  Sagittal STIR image demonstrates fat stranding in subcutaneous tissue with increased signal intensity centrally within lesion.  Post gadolinium images demonstrate a peripheral rim of enhancement in a septated subcutaneous lesion.
Subcutaneous Abscess
Abscess
Epidermal inclusion cyst
37 year old with EIC on back.  Evaluate for spinal involvement.
:  The first line imaging study for a subcutaneous abscess should be an ultrasound of the lesion.  It will characterized the extent of the lesion in most cases and MRI with gadolinium will not be necessary.  This is  a costly answer to a simple question.
