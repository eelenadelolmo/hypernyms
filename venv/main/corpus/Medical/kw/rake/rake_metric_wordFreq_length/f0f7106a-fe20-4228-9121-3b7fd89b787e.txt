Decreased breast sounds in the right lung base.
Cultures and gram stain were negative for organisms.  Cytology was negative for malignancy.

The patient was admitted for treatment and evaluation.  Follow up evaluation is recommended to evaluate for interval change of pulmonary nodules.
Large right sided pleural effusion with collapse of the right lower and right middle lung.  Fluid denisty within the right main bronchus, bronchus intermedius and several smaller bronchioles on the right.  Multiple noncalcified pulmonary nodules.
Aspiration Pneumonia and heart failure
aspiration pneumonia
malignant pleural effusion
heart failure
88 year old male presented to the ER with worsening SOB
