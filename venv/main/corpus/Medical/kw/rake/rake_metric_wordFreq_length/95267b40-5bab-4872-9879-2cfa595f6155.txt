Supportive
â€¢ CT: Subtle hypodensity in corpus callosum. 
â€¢ MR Diffusion: This lesion is much better evaluated on the diffusion weighted MR images, where it is bright on DWI and dark on ADC suggesting cytotoxic edema.  
â€¢ MR T2 and FLAIR:  Bright lesion on these images, but less so than the DWI.
Diffuse Axonal Injury
â€¢ Diffuse axonal injury
â€¢ Demyelinating process
â€¢ Lymphoma (would expect enhancment)
â€¢ Transient lesion in splenium in an epileptic patient
25 year old man with closed head trauma after  blast.
There is a subtle hypodensity on the CT images in the corpus callosum that corresponds to the high signal on the DWI images.  This is infrequently seen.
