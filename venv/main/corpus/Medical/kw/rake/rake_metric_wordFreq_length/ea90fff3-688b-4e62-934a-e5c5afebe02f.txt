A CP myotomy may be done by an external (open) or an endoscopic approach. The endoscopic approach uses a laser and is faster and has a lower complication rate than the external approach. Both approaches are done as an outpatient or overnight stay in the hospital.

Pulsion diverticulum above cricopharyngeal muscle, which is hypertrophied.
Zenker's diverticulum
Zenker's diverticulum above cricopharyngeal bar.
Neoplasm

Difficuly swallowing. Strange taste in mouth.
Direct visualization may be helpful if diagnosis is uncertain.
Manoflurography is the best test to determine if the CP is opening properly. The test measures the intrabolus pressure gradient across the CP muscle. If this gradient is elevated, dividing the CP muscle may relieve the obstruction and improve swallowing. This procedure is called a CP myotomy.
