This patient could benefit from:
â€¢ Balloon dilation
â€¢ Botulinum toxin injection
â€¢ Heller cardiomyotomy   
â€¢ Calcium channel blockers
Two views were made and demonstrate distention of the esophagus, which is filled with food debris and deviates the trachea anteriorly. The findings are consistent with a dilated esophagus, possibbly from achalasia.  The peripheral lung fields show no evidence of infiltrate, nodule or mass. There is certainly no evidence of cavitary lesion or enlargement of the pulmonary hila.
Primary Achalasia
â€¢ Primary achalasia
â€¢ Secondary achalasia (intrinsic or extrinsic neoplasm
â€¢ Scleroderma 
â€¢ Peptic stricture
â€¢ Chagas disease
48 year old man with a positive PPD test.
Achalasia is a primary motility disorder of the esophagus that affects only 1 in every 100,000 people. 
With primary achalasia, patients usually have a longstanding history of dysphagia, weight loss, and regurgitation. 

The absence of primary peristalsis in the distal two-thirds of the esophagus and failure of esophageal sphincter to relax is thought to be due to an abnormality of myenteric ganglia in Auerbachâ€™s plexus. 

A chest x-ray may reveal classic mediastinal widening with dilatation of the esophagus. The classic appearance on barium esophagrams has been described as  a "Moosie-Bird-beak" or "sigmoid-like" with smooth conical narrowing at the GE junction. The characteristic imaging manifestations combined with the absence of primary peristalsis aid in the diagnosis.      

Patients with an esophageal condition such as achalasia, are at an increased risk for aspiration; thus in this case, achalasia could be responsible for the positive PPD due to a mycobacterial infection.
