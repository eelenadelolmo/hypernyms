Ocular exam demonstrated a swollen right optic nerve.
The Opthomology service was consulted and the patient underwent radiologic and laboratory evaluation for ebv, lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, meningitis, sarcoid, syphillis, and lupus with negative results for all etiologies. The patient was subsquently treated with steroids and had complete visual recovery.
CT of the orbits shows asymmetry of the optic nerves with the right optic nerve enlarged when compared to the left. Subsequent MRI evaluation of the orbits demonstrates enlargement of the right optic nerve with associated abnormal increased T2 signal intensity and enhancement on post-gadolinium series extending from globe to just anterior to the optic chiasm. Enhancement of the intraorbital fat adjacent to the nerve is also present. The remainder of the optic pathways are normal (not shown).
Optic Neuritis (imaging and clinical findings combined to verify diagnosis)
Optic nerve glioma
Meningioma
Graves disease
Sarcoidosis
A 6 YO female presented to the emergency department with a 3 day history of right eye pain and severe decreasing visual acuity.
