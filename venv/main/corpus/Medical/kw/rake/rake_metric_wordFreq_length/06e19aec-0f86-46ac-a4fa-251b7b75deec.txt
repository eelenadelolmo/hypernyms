Positive patellar grinding
Knees are not tender
Patient has full range of motion

LAB: Within Normal Limits Except -
PTT 85 (N 22-36)
Factor VIII activity = 0.31 (N 50-150)
Patient had previously undergone arthroscopy with partial lateral meniscectomy and partial synovectomy.

Patient is currently undergoing physical therapy in order to strengthen the quadracepts muscles.

Because of the patients age, a total knee replacement is being delayed as long as possible.
» AP Plain Film of Both Knees:
• Tricompartment degenerative changes bilaterally
• Subchondral sclerosis, geode formation, and marginal osteophytes
• Suprapatellar joint effusion on right knee

» Lateral Plain Film Right Knee:
• Squaring of inferior pole of patella

» MR Images:
• Lack of meniscal tissue in medial and lateral compartments
• Extensive subchondral cyst formation in femoral condyles
• Geode in lateral tibial plateau
Hemophilia with arthritis
• Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis
• Hemophilic Arthritis (repeated hemoarthrosis)
• Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS)
• Early Osteoarthritic Changes
This 27 year old man, with a history of hemophilia A, has been suffering from bilateral knee pain for the past 10 years.

He describes an "achy" pain, worse in the right knee, and located anteriorly without radiation.  His pain is worse with standing and ambulation.
Two forms of hemophilia are most commonly associated with intraarticular bleeding.

1.  Hemophilia A with a functional deficiency of factor VIII
2.  Hemophilia B(Christmas disease)with a functional deficiency of factor IX

These are X-linked recessive disorders clinically manifested in men with women being carriers.   

Five radiographic stages are described by Arnold and Hilgartner
Stage I - Soft tissue swelling and hemarthrosis
Stage II - Osteoporosis
Stage III - Osseous lesions (subchondral cysts)
Stage IV - Cartilage destruction
Stage V - Joint disorganization

Our patient has stage V finding in the knee.  The knee is the most commonly affected joint in Hemophilia and dense joint effusions are common.  The knee damage may progress to fixed flexion deformity and subluxation.
