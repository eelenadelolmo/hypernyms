Texto: 
Patient is a mildly obese boy with abnormal head size and microphthalmia. Neuro exam reveals depressed gag reflexes with severe developmental delay. 

Extremities show no clubbing but abnormal foot structure. All other systems are within normal limits.   

Creatine Kinase levels are abnormally low at 37 U/L.
The patient has been given seizure prophylaxis with phenobarbital elixir and topomax tablets and will be followed up every two weeks.
Image 1: Coronal T2 weighted image shows marked decreased gyral folds, a thin layer of gray matter, and ventriculomegaly leading to diagnosis of type 2 lissencephaly. 

Image 2: Sagittal T2 weighted image shows dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, markedly underdeveloped cerebellar hemispheres, and an enlarged fourth ventricle and widened cerebral aqueduct indicative of hydrocephalus. 

Image 3: Axial T2 weighted FSE image shows significant ventriculomegaly indicative of hydrocephalus. 

Image 4: AP Femur image shows underdeveloped muscle fibers with irregularly bowed and radiolucent bone most prominent at the distal femur.

The patient is a five year old boy born four weeks premature. The child is currently afflicted with chronic developmental delay disorder, seizure disorder, and respiratory distress.
This patient is currently stable  with physical therapy and seizure prophylaxis with Topomax and phenobarbital elixir. The patient is currently blind with profound global delay but all other organ systems are within normal limits.
