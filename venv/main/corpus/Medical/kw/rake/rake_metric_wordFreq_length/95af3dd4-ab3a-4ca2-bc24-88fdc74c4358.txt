No new focal neurological deficits.  Preoperative R lower extremity paresis and parathesias.  Surgical drains in place.
Operative team was contacted regarding findings including T2 cord changes who reemphasized no new focal neurological defects were present.  Preoperative findings included R lower extremity paresis and parathesias.  Further review of preoperative studies confirmed high T2 signal within the cord at the T12 was unchanged.  Operative team elected to maintain surgical drains and observe the patient.
Fluid-fluid (hematocrit level) surrounding posterior fusion hardware in region of T11-L1 surgery consistent with seroma-hematoma in the early post-operative period.  Metallic artifact and posterior surgical drains are present.  Posterior compression of the thecal sac at the T12 level to approximately 6 mm with internal cord T2 hyperintensity.
Failed back syndrome, post operative hematoma in the lumbar spine.
Normal post-operative pain
Failed back syndrome
27 year old man with continued pain following back surgery.
