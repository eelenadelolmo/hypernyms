Unremarkable
NA
CXR: There has been resection of segment of posterior right fifth rib.
Surgical clips are seen in the lateral view above the heart.  There is
diffuse left reticulonodular pattern, greater at the base and periphery. The
right lung is hyperexpanded.  There are linear opacities at the right lung base.
The right costophrenic angles are blunted, likely representing fibrosis.  The
mediastinal structures are shifted to the left.  There is a double arch of
aorta. There is an air-fluid level in the lower esophagus suggesting an
increased dilatation of the esophagus that may have progressed from the prior
CT exam.
Double Aortic Arch
(before CT)
Double aortic arch
Right arch with aberrant left subclavian artery
