Multi-sequence, multi-planar MRI of the brain demonstrates cortical hyperintensity involving the parietal lobes posteriorly and symmetrically on T2 weighted images with corresponding restricted diffusion.  Following gadolinium DTPA, no enhancement of the cortex is seen.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
Cerebral infarction
Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
Encephalitis
35 year old active duty male presents with progressive cognitive decline.
The cortical changes in hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy usually occurs at water-shed zones.  Hence this case would be an unusual distribution for hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.
