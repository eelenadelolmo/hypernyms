Texto: 
The baby was cyanotic, had severe tachypnoea with respiratory rate of 110-120/minute and chest retractions. He had tachycardia with heart rate of 160 ‚Äì180/minute, and the heart sounds were audible on the right side of the chest.
NA
X-ray chest showed increased density in the right hemi thorax, absent cardio- mediastinal structures on the left side and hyperinflation of the leftlung .The ultrasound of the thorax revealed dextroposition of heart and a large atrial secundum defect. A large anomalous pulmonary vein crossing the diaphragm and joining the hepatic inferior vena cava was noted. Thus the diagnosis of ‚ÄúScimitar syndrome‚Äù was considered in view of partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, hypoplastic right lung and dextroposition of the heart. 
The baby was managed with decongestive measures, antibiotics and ventilator support. 
X-ray chest done on seventh day of admission revealed the classic ‚ÄúScimitar sign‚Äù as a result of clearing of right

A ten-day-old male baby was admitted to intensive care unit with respiratory distress. He was a full term baby born at home to a primiparous mother. Immediate postnatal period was uneventful. On fifth day of life he developed respiratory distress and was admitted to the hospital. There was no evidence of any external congenital anomalies.Crackles on left side of chest were present on systemic examination.

The diagnosis of ‚ÄúScimitar syndrome‚Äù was considered in view of partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, hypoplastic right lung and dextroposition of the heart.
