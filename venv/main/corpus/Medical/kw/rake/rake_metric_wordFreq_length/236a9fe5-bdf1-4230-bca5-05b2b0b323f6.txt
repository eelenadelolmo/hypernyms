Texto: 
Physical exam remarkable for decreased strength in left arm.  Routine labs all within normal limits.
Ongoing.  Patient just diagnosed.
Multiple ring-enhancing lesions in both cerebral hemispheres.  Diffusion weighted imaging shows low signal intensity within the lesions confirmed with ADC mapping.
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)
Multiple abscesses
Lymphoma
Glioblastoma multiforme
Infarct
Male presents to neurology clinic with vague complaints of minor left-sided arm weakness, transient in nature.
This case illustrates an interesting and unfortunate case of GBM.  The multifocal ring enhancing lesions can also appear similar to those seen with pyogenic abscess or lymphoma, but the diffusion-weighted images favor GBM. Infarct is not likely given the involvement and crossing of the corpus collosum. Biopsy proved these lesions to be consistent with glioblastoma multiforme.  The prognosis is very poor.
