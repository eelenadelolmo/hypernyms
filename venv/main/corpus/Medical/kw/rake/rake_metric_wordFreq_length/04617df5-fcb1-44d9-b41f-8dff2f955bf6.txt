Texto: 
Diffuse joint tenderness on palpation.
Total synovectomy with external beam radiation.
Plain films: AP and lateral radiography show mild bony demineralization. A small to moderate joint effusion is also seen. 

MRI:  Proton-density sequence that shows cystic changes at the origin of the gastrocnemius. A low attenuated signal lesion is observed in the posterior joint space along with moderate joint effusion. Sagittal T2 Fat Suppresion showing areas of low attenuation intermixed with areas of high attenuation within the posterior joint space.  A T2 Fast Spin Echo sequence with fat saturation showing low attenuation in the posterior compartment of the joint space, referred to as â€˜bloomingâ€™.
Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis
(1)Intra-articular giant cell tumor of tendon sheath. (2)Rheumatoid arthritis.
 (3)Gout. 
(4)Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis. 
(5)Primary noncalcified synovial chondromatosis.
Patient is a 29 year-old male who presents to orthopedic clinic with right knee pain.  Reports no recent trauma, injuries, or other specifically aggravating activities.  Describes the pain as dull and located throughout the knee.  Has had similar pain over the past year.
Patient had previous diagnosis of pigmented villonodular synovitis treated with partial synovectomy. This recurred as seen with  this current examination. He is scheduled for follow-up total synovectomy with external beam radiation treatment. The recurrence rate of diffuse pigmented villonodular synovitis following synovectomy ranges from 20-50%.
