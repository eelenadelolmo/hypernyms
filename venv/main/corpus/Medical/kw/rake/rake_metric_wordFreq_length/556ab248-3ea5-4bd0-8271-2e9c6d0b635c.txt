Patient is a healthy-appearing 19-year old female.  Laboratory values are significant for negative beta-HCG, negative urine and no elevated white blood cell count or fever.  The patient’s Hgb and Hct were 9.3 and 28.2.  The rest of her laboratory work up was unremarkable.
Patient was taken to surgery for removal of both ovarian dermoids.
Contrast enhanced scan through the lower abdomen and pelvis demonstrate two large lobulated cystic masses containing fat and calcification. These masses appear to arise from the ovaries and extend into the lower abdomen.   There is no associated fat stranding or inflammatory changes.  No large fluid collections or abscesses are seen within the abdomen or pelvis.  No abdominal or pelvic lymphadenopathyis present.
Dermoid cyst (Cystic Teratoma)
Fat attenuation within a cyst with associated calcification is diagnostic for a mature cystic teratoma.
19-year old female presented to the emergency department with right lower quadrant pain x 1 day.  A CT scan was ordered to rule out appendicitis.
Tumors of germ cell origin are the second most common type of ovarian tumor accounting for 15-20% of ovarian neoplasms.  (Epithelial tumors are the most common type of ovarian neoplasm, and represent 60% of all ovarian neoplasms).  Mature cystic teratomas, also called dermoid cysts, are the most common germ cell neoplasm, and are the most common ovarian mass in children.   These are cystic tumors composed of well-differentiated tissue from at least two of the three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm).  On imaging, dermoid cysts range in appearance from purely cystic to a mixed mass with calcium and fat to a mass composed of predominantly fat. 

Mature cystic teratomas are considered a benign neoplasm, however approximately 2% are complicated by malignancy.  Torsion is also a common complication.  In this patient, her right lower quadrant pain was likely caused by torsion secondary to the large size of the dermoid cysts.  The tumors can also rupture, which results in leakage of the sebaceous material material into the peritoneum.
