'Enlarged liver' - otherwise unremarkable

No clinical evidence of hypertension

CBC - within normal limits
Serum and Urine metanephrines - within normal limits
24-Hour Urine - within normal limits
Further evaluation is underway to determine exact subtype of B-Cell Lymphoma prior to initiation of treatment.
10 cm abdominal enhancing mass superior to right kidney, with internal flow on ultrasound, distinct from adrenal gland.  No abdominal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma - B-Cell Lymphoma
Pancreatic Carcinoma
Pheochromocytoma
Lymphoma
60 year-old man with enlarged liver by physical exam.
Initial biopsy revealed that the tumor cells are strongly positive for CD20 and focally positive for CD99; but negative for cytokeratin, S100, and mesenchymal markers consistent with atypical B-cell Lymphoma.

Follow-up flow cytometry revealed that predominant cell population are B-cells expressing CD45, CD20 (bright), CD19, CD10, FMC-7 and CD38.  The kappa to lambda ratio is greater than 1:100, lambda light chain restricted.  They are negative for CD34, CD5, and CD23. Differential diagnosis includes Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma and Burkitt's Lymphoma.
