1.  The indeterminate small enhancing, well defined nodules in both breasts were recommended for 6 month follow-up breast MRI.
2.  The fibroadenoma requires no work-up.
There are enhancing 4 mm nodules in both breasts that are too small to accurately characterize with time/intensity curves.  Approximately 2 cm behind the right nipple is a characteristically benign and gradually enhancing 1.7 cm lesion with the imaging characteristics of a fibroadenoma.  It has well -defined borders and is most conspicuous on the most delayed images.  It's maximum length is 1.7 cm, height is 1 cm, and width is 9 mm.
