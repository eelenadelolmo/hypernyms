Patient ambulates without apparent abnormality.
Examination: AP view of the pelvis. No similar prior study.  
     
FINDINGS: Examination is abnormal. There is marked flattening of both  femoral  heads, especially on the left side. There is medial migration of  the bilateral  femoral heads and both hip joints appear more shallow and  irregular than generally seen, especially on the left side. No acute  fracture or dislocation.
Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip vs Legg-Perthe-Calve
In a patient of this age the findings are most likely a  sequela of a childhood disease such as  developmental dysplasia of the hip or Legg-Calve-Perthes syndrome (avascular necrosis of the hip)
34 y.o. active duty man presents to MSK sick call with complaint of chronic, left-sided hip pain.  He states that he has had this pain for years - but it has gotten steadily worse over the past 3-4 years.
In a patient of this age the findings on this examination are most likely a  sequela of a childhood disease such as  developmental dysplasia of the hip or Legg-Calve-Perthes syndrome (avascular necrosis of the hip).

Developmental dysplasia of the hip is usually a pediatric finding which presents with hip joint laxity and dislocation.    Congenital hip dislocation is rare without other contributing pathology such as neoplasia.  More common is a mild hip laxity with a shallow acetabulum that has the potential to progress over the life of the child to become a severe hip dysplasia with hip dislocation - early osteoarthritis is also a possible outcome.  With mild laxity, the femoral head can have a wider range of motion within the acetabulum.  The acetabulum then develops a wider, shallower shape to accommodate the femoral head.  The femoral head can develop a flattening along its superiomedial aspect.  The attached musculature can pull the femoral head superiorly resulting in dislocation out of the acetabulum in a superior direction.  Developmental dysplasia of the hip occurs in 1 out of every 1,000 births and is bilateral in 1/3 of those cases.  Hip replacement surgery, as early as the fourth decade of life, is sometimes required for extreme cases.  Ultrasound can be used for diagnosis in infants less than three months of age.  Ultrasound also allows for dynamic evaluation of the hip looking for laxity.  Once the infant reaches the three month point, ossification of the capital femoral epiphyses begins to limit the value of ultrasound as the bone blocks the view of the acetabulum.  At this point, radiography is better suited for evaluating the hip joint.  Early intervention with efforts to retain the hip in a flexed, abducted, and externally rotated position are effective.  Later intervention with braces, casts, or surgery may be necessary in children who present later in life.  

Legg-Calves-Perthes, also known as avascular necrosis of the hip, is a condition of insufficient blood flow to the femoral head.  This causes weakening of the effected femoral head (bilateral in 1/10 of cases).  Because it is weakened, mechanical forces on the femoral head can cause it to flatten with childhood development.  There are multiple causes of Legg-Calves-Perthes, but a pneumonic, ASEPTIC, highlights several: A - sickle cell antemia, S - steroids, E - ethanol, P - pancreatitis, T - trauma, I - idiopathic or infection, C - caisson disease.  Caisson disease is commonly known as decompression sickness or "the bends."   It his caused by the expansion of dissolved nitrogen in the blood when a person goes from a high pressure to a normal or low pressure environment.  This is often encountered in divers and was first described during the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge.
