non-contributory except for asymmetric appearing face and cranium.
Surgical re-opening of suture
Radiographs of the skull demonstrate asymmetry of the cranial bones and a “harlequin” appearance to the right orbit.  The right parietal bone is also noticeably smaller than the contralateral side.

Bone window computed tomographic images of the skull are effective in demonstrating suture lines.  These images show an open left coronal suture while the right sided coronal suture is not seen.

Three dimensional reformatted images demonstrate to great advantage the asymmetry in the coronal sutures.  It is clear that the right coronal suture is closed.
Primary (Idiopathic) Craniosynostosis, plagiocephaly (unilateral coronal suture involvment)
1. Primary (idiopathic) premature craniosynostosis
    A. Abnormal dural development
    B. Trauma

2. Congenital Syndromes
   A. Apert Syndrome
   B. Crouzon disease
   C. Carpenter syndrome

3. Decreased intracranial pressure
   A. Brain atrophy
   B. Microcephaly
   C. Shunted hydrocephalus

4. Metabolic disorders
   A. Rickets
   B. Hypophosphatasia
   C. Anemia
   D. Hypothyroidism, Cretinism (treated)
   E. Hyperthyroidism

5. Other causes of "Harlequin Eye" deformity
   A. Neurofibromatosis (dysplastic greater wing of sphenoid) 
   B. Subdural bleed or brain tumor (focal calvarial expansion)
4 month old male with asymmetric head and no other significant medical problems.
