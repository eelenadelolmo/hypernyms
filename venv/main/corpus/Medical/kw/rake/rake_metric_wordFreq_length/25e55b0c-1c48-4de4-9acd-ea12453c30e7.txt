The treatment for MAC is currently debated, but it tends to somewhat mirror TB treatment.4,5 The Pt was started on Clarithromycin 500mg PO BID with ethambutol 20mg/kg QDay, rifampin 600mg Qday for 12 months until culture negative.4,5 Streptomycin 1g 3-5 days Qwek for 6-12 weeks is specifically for treatment of the cavitation.5
CT (09-Dec-2008)
1. No PE or DVT. 
2. Consolidation of the apical posterior segment of the right upper lobe  consistent with pneumonia. 
3. Diffuse interstitial disease, pulmonary fibrosis and traction  bronchiectasis consistent with history of sarcoidosis.

Chest PA/Lat (09-Dec-2008):
1. Diminished right lower lobe infiltrative process.
2. Diffuse bilateral interstitial lung disease, not appreciably changed.   
3. Persistent right apical pleural thickening.

CT (06-Apr-2009)
1. Increased right middle lobe consolidation with a 2.4 cm cavitation.
2. Nearly resolved right upper lobe consolidation.   
3. Traction bronchiectasis and fibrosis as described as can be seen with sarcoidosis.   
4. At the lung bases, there are fibrotic and emphysematous like changes.   
5. Stable mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Mycobacterial avium complex pulmonary infection
• Sacoidosis exacerbation
• TB
• NTM
• Pulmonary SCC
• Fungal infection
Patient is a 49 y/o AD USN male with history of sarcoidosis presented to his PCM in early December with a 4 day history of dyspnea and myalgias. He was originally seen by a civilian provider and was given azitrhomycin 250mg which had no effect on his condition. Upon admission he noted fatigue, cough and pleuritic chest pain. His pulse oximetry was 88% while walking, whereas his normal baseline is 95%. His home medications include Advair and Spiriva. Pt was admitted to hospital for sarcoid exacerbation with an elevated WBC of 11.3. He was started on prednisone taper and levofloxacin 750mg QDay for 21 days. A Chest posterior-anterior and lateral x-ray showed RML and RUL opacity consistent with infection. A CT, PE protocol 1.25 mm contiguous axial images with IV contrast was performed which showed consolidation of the apical posterior segment of the right upper lobe consistent with pneumonia. The patient was discharged from the hospital. He returned to his PCM intermittently with very little improvement. In April he returned to his PCM with thick green sputum, fevers of 102.9 and nightsweats while on levofloxacin. A sputum sample was taken which showed candida albicans and AFB. The patient was isolated for TB at that time, and the reflexive PCR showed the AFB to be Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) which is a Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). A chest CT without contrast, 5 mm thick axial slices, was obtained which showed increased right middle lobe consolidation with a 2.4 cm cavitation and nearly resolved right upper lobe consolidation.
