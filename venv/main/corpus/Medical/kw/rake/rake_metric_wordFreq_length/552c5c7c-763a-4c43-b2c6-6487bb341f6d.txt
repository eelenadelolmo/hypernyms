Hemoccult stool testing was positive for blood
Due to the metastatic disease, chemotherapy is ongoing.  Diverting colostomy was performed as well.
Axial CT images demonstrate abnormal pericolonic soft-tissue stranding and nodularity.  Abnormal lymph nodes are seen in the colonic mesentery.  Hypoattenuating enhancing liver lesions are noted.  GI fluoroscopy (single contrast enema) reveals a constricting submucosal lesion near the hepatic flexure.
Colon Cancer
Colon cancer
Focal colonic infection
Ischemia
61 y.o. man with intermittent lower abdominal pain and constipation; the patient has never had an optical colonoscopy screenng exam (he refused further testing after a bad experience with a flexible sigmoidoscopy).
Colon cancer screening with optical colonoscopy is underutilized (many patients do not get this test due to fear of the exam, financial contraints, access problems, etc).  As CT colonography (CTC) continues to gain favor, finding pre-malignant adenomatous polyps before they become malignant colon cancers is important if we are to decrease mortality from colon cancer.
