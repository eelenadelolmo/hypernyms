Asmptomatic patient with palpably enlarged uterus.
None.
A lobular, heterogeneous bladder mass that measures
3.7 x 3.0 x 2.4 cm is seen arising from the posterior bladder wall and extending in a frond-like manner intraluminally. This mass demonstrates arterial vascular flow along the periphery. There are internal areas of hypoechogenicity that may be partially cystic.  While separate from the uterus and appearing to arise from the bladder wall, this area is immediately anterior to the region of known prior cesaren section.
Endometriosis
-Endometriosis
-Transitional cell carcinoma
-Cystitis
-Post radiation change
-Postoperative change
-Adherent blood clot
-Lymphoma
-Metastases
-Neurofibromatosis
Patient has enlarged uterus, rule out fibroid.
Asymptomatic endometriosis incidentally discovered.  Having come across several of these cases where there is a mass in the bladder that extends intraluminally and appears mucosal, I have learned to list endometriosis as the top of the differential when it is in young women.
