Negative sonographic Murphy's.
Normal LFT's.
The clinician and the patient will discuss the options, though continued monitoring is a likely plan given the patient's age.
6mm x 12mm x 11mm hypoechoic filling defect in the posterior gallbladder wall with a broad based stalk and no evidence of abnormal shadowing.  Normally distended gallbladder with no evidence of wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid.
Gallbladder Polyp, Histological diagnosis unknown
Cholesterol polyp, adherent stone or sludge, adenomyomatosis, carcinoma, metastasis (melanoma, GI, breast), ectopic mucosa, benign tumor – adenoma, papilloma, lipoma
86 yo woman with intermittent, vague epigastric pain and normal liver function on laboratory analysis.
Given the size of the polyp and the patient's demographic, malignancy is the diagnosis of exclusion, though no concerning findings (other than size) were noted on the ultrasound.
