Laboratory values were significant for LDH of 1773, WBC 27.4 and platelet count of 27 (nl 162-142).
Patient was kept on mechanical ventilation until the family decided to remove life support.
Portable chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes and diffuse bilateral air space conolidation.  Pleural effusions are not evident on this image.  A right-sided tunneled catheter is present.

52-year-old female with AML and persistent fevers on chemotherapy.  Patient presented to the emergency room with fever.
Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a syndrome of acute respiratory failure with associated chest radiograph findings demonstrating diffuse air space opacification.  ARDS can be differentiated from pulmonary edema by a more peripheral distribution of opacification and lack of septal lines.  Pleural effusions are usually absent, and lung volumes are typically reduced.  

Risk factors for developing ARDS include trauma, sepsis, fat emboli, severe pneumonia, multiple transfusions, aspiration of gastric contrents, and near drowning.  Often, more than one risk factor is present
