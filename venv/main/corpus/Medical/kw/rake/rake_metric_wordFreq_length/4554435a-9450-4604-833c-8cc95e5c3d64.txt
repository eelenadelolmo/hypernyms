High signal intensity expansile lesion right petrous apex.

No associated enhancement
Cholesterol granuloma
- Assymetric fatty marrow: Non-expansile

- Congenital cholesteatoma of the petrous apex: Low to intermediate signal on T1

- Trapped fluid within petrous apex: Low to intermediate signal on T1

- Apical petrositis: Low signal on T1, psot-contrast thick enhancing rim.
13 year old female in a MVA 6 years ago.  She was found to have an expansile lesion on CT scan done at that time.  Lesion has been followed with MRI and found to be stable ever since that time.
