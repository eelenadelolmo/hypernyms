Texto: 
Physical exam and neurological normal except for increased headache with neck flexion.
Treatment is considered in symptomatic patients; and, includes surgical decompression via a suboccipital craniectomy with a dural graft or cervical laminectomy. 

Hydrocephalus can be treated with ventricular shunt systems. 

Syringomyelia can be treated by catheter drainage or constructing a spinal cord shunt system.  Myelomeningoceles and encephaloceles associated with type II and type III malformations require primary neurosurgical repair. 

Prognosis varies depending on the type of Chiari malformation. Symptomatic type I malformations are usually treatable medically or surgically with most patients surviving into adulthood. In type II malformations, 15% of symptomatic patients die by 2 years of age.  Many patients with type III malformations have secondary complications, and some may not survive beyond 2- 3 years of age.
• Image 1. MRI Brain, T1 weighted sagittal view, post contrast – Low lying cerebellar tonsils that extend approximately 6mm past the foramen magnum by approximately 6 mm. The ventricles are normal in size and configuration. The septum pellucidum and corpus callosum are present and there are no extra-axial fluid collections.  

• Image 11. MRI Cervical Spine, T2 weighted sagittal view– There is cervical syringohydromyelia that extends from the C4 to the C6 level Cross-sectional dimensions are 5 x 4 mm. The central canal is patent and there is normal alignment of the cervical vertebral elements.

• Image 14. Cine MRI – Sagittal view showing CSF flow with cardiac gating. – The CSF flow sequence shows effacement of the CSF spaces surrounding the foramen magnum. There is flow anterior and posterior to the cord at the foramen magnum. There is flow posterior to the cerebellar tonsils.  

• Image 15. Cine MRI – Sagittal view showing CSF flow with cardiac gating. – The CSF flow sequences show effacement of the CSF spaces surrounding the foramen magnum. There is flow anterior and posterior to the cord at the foramen magnum.
Chiari Type I Malformation
• Chiari Malformation
• Herniated Cerebellar tonsils secondary to intracranial lesion/hemorrhage and resulting mass effect
• Hydrocephalus
This 15 year old girl has headaches for 3 months. She has had no relief with Tylenol, Flexeril, and Amitriptyline. Associated symptoms include feelings of having a swollen throat, a feeling of a clogged left ear, occasional blurry vision, constant nausea and feelings of imbalance. She denies a history of falling because of losing balance, and she denies vomiting or dysphasia.
