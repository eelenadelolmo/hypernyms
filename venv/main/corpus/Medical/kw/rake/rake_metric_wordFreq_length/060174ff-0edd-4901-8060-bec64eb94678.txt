Gen: alert, playful, NAD 
HEENT: +RR, no scleral injection, right cheek slightly edematous, MMM, right TM erythematous and slightly bulging, good cone of light, no purulence, right tonsil pushed past midline, 3+, saliva pooling in oropharynx. 
Neck: right posterior jaw slightly edematous, supple, shotty cervical LAN 
Otherwise normal.
After diagnosis of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, she underwent Infusaport placement and will receive chemotherapy with Vincristine, actinomycin-D, and cytoxan with Mesna for the next 12 weeks.  She will begin local radiation therapy three weeks from the onset of chemotherapy with close follow ups with her heme/onc physician.
• CT Neck with contrast on day of admission
  There  is  a  large  (5  cm  diameter)  heterogeneous  mass  in  the  right parapharyngeal  space.  It is solid  in  appearance  with  small  areas  of enhancement  suggesting  vessels  within  it.  No evidence  of  fat  or ossification.    The  mass  appears  to  have  eroded  portions  of  the  right mandible  and  possibly  invaded  the  skull  base.  There is moderate adenopathy  in  the  anterior  cervical  chains  bilaterally.

• MRI neck with and without Gadolinium
The  large  mass  seen  on  CT  is  again  identified,  centered  in the  right  parapharyngeal  space.  Relative  to  muscle,  it  is  hyperintense on  T2-weighted  sequences  and  isointense  on  T1-weighted  sequences.  It enhances  heterogeneously.    There  are  no  prominent  flow-voids  within  the mass  to  suggest  large  arteries.  There  are  no  findings  to  suggest significant  bleeding  at  the  biopsy  site.  The  mass  measures  approximately 7.3  cm  transverse  x  3.3  cm  AP  x  4.3  cm  vertical.  Involvement  of  the skull  base  and  mandible  is  better  demonstrated  on  CT.  There is no intracranial  extension  through  the  skull  base  foramina.  The  mass displaces  the  carotid  sheath  posteriorly,  but  does  not  encase  the vessels.  There  is  sluggish  flow  in  the  right  jugular  vein,  but  no definite  invasion  or  thrombosis.    The airway  is  effaced  and displaced toward  the  left.  The  mass  displaces  the  right  parotid  gland  laterally; it  is  difficult  to  tell  if  the  gland  is  invaded  or  simply  compressed.  No separate  mass  is  identified.  There  are  bilateral  cervical  chain  lymph nodes,  but  none  appears  markedly  enlarged.
Rhabdomyosarcoma (alveolar type)
• Metastatic Neuroblastoma
• Rhabdomyosarcoma
• Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
• Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma
• Leukemia
• Lymphoma
• Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis
The patient is a 10-year-old black girl who was reportedly previously healthy, except for very mild asthma.  Approximately 1.5 months prior to hospitalization, she developed a sore throat, nonproductive cough, snoring, and hoarseness. She was given analgesics along with antitussive medications to take at home. Her symptoms worsened over the next several days with increased right face and neck swelling plus right ear pain. She was re-evaluated and was given amoxicillin and had a neck x-ray performed ( not available for review).  She was sent to the ENT clinic after three more days of increasing symptoms.  She was directly admitted from ENT clinic to the hospital for IV antibiotics and possible I&D with a provisional diagnosis of peritonsilar abscess.

Social Hx: Lives with mom, 2 brothers, no pets, mom and brother smoke inside, she is in 4th grade (As and Bs), no daycare, immunizations up to date. 
ROS: 
Gen: slightly more fatigue, no increased fussiness 
HEENT: right ear pain, watery eyes/red eyes 
Pulm: +cough, no wheeze/SOB 
Otherwise normal.
