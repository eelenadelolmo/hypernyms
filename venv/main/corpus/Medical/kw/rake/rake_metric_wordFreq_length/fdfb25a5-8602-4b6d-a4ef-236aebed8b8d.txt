No abnormalities noted during testicular exam.
Annual followup ultrasound.
Ultrasound of the bilateral testes demonstrates multiple 1-2 mm hyperechoic nonshadowing foci present throughout the testicular parenchyma.
Testicular microlithiasis
PUNCTATE HYPERECHOIC FOCI: (Microlithiasis DDx)
1. granulomatous changes 
2. scar 
3. benign adenomatoid tumor 
4. hemorrhage with infarction
5. post-inflammatory changes
6. large calcifying Sertoli cell tumor
36 year old male with chronic testicular pain for several years. Requests evaluation for pathology.
Classic Testicular microlithiasis is defined as greater than 5 hyperechoic nonshadowing foci (in one image) throughout the parenchyma of the testes. Although frequently symmetric, it can often times be asymptomatic and seen on the periphery of the testis. In patients where less than 5 foci are present per image, limited microlithiasis is diagnosed. 

Previously it was thought that germ cell tumors were present in up to 40% of patients with microlithiasis (Ref 1 and 2). This corresponded to approximately 21 times increased risk of testicular cancer. Due to these limited studies, there were controversial recommendations to perform yearly ultrasound follow-up examinations in these patients. These studies were performed with small patient numbers in individuals referred for ultrasound due to identification of testicular masses. 

More recent studies (Ref 3 and 4) were performed with much larger study subjects involving all patients undergoing testicular ultrasound for any reason. They have demonstrated less risk (8%) of testicular neoplasms in patients with microlithiasis than previously thought. Moreover, with an average follow-up ultrasound average of 42 months, no additional tumors were identified in these patients (Ref 4). The authors of these studies suggested that it would not significantly affect mortality/morbidity to continue annual ultrasound surveillance. They suggested a more reasonable approach to patients with limited/classic microlithiasis would be to perform annual physical exams and montly self-exams.
