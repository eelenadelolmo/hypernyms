Hard discrete bony prominence over the left occipito-parietal region of the skull.
No treatment is needed. Depending on their size, cephalohematomas get absorbed over a period of 2 weeks to 3 months.  The radiographic findings can persist much longer than the clinical findings.  The outer table of bone usually remains thickened as a flat, irregular hyperostosis for several months and is gradually resorbed.  In some cases, the space between the new shell of bone and the inner table remains widened for many years.  The space originally occupied by the hematoma becomes filled with normal diploic bone.  Occasionally, infantile cephalohematomas can persist into adult life causing large segments of bone production and destruction within the calvarium.  This condition is known as cephalohematoma deformans.
A lenticular area of lucent bone is present over the left parietal region of the skull.  The area of relative lucency has a thin sclerotic rim.  The sclerotic rim is external to the calvarium and is overriding the left parietal bone.  There are no erosions involving the underlying calvarium.

2 month old baby girl with a bony prominence along the left occipito-parietal region of the skull.  This has been present since birth.  Suction devices were used during the delivery.
This subperiosteal cephalohematoma is thought to be the result of birth trauma.  Passage through the birth canal and cervix alone is enough to pull the external periosteum from the underlying calvarium.  The likelihood of this condition occurring is increased when instruments are used for delivery.  A suction device was used during this patient’s delivery which may have been the inciting event.  This cephalohematoma does not the cross suture lines of the skull.  If a cephalohematoma does cross a suture line, one has to be concerned about a possible underlying skull fracture.  This patient’s cephalohematoma was related to childbirth; however, if the patient presented with a hematoma later in life without any history of trauma, one should consider  a possible clotting disorder in the differential.   As in this case,  the parietal bones are most often affected while frontal cephalohematomas are very rare.
