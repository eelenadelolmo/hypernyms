Air Contrast Barium Enema:

1) Loss of Haustral Markings throughout colon.
2) Tapered narrowing of left colon.
3) Diffuse, coarse, granular mucosal pattern throughout colon.
4) Numerous colonic luminal protrusions (pseudopolyps) in left and sigmoid colon.
5) Numerous ulcerations throughout the colon with "collar button" configuration in left colon with confluence.
6) Superficial ulceration of distal ileum consistent with "backwash ileitis".

27yo male who presents with a history of bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain.
The air contrast barium enema performed on this
patient with a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis demonstrates many of the radiographic features of inflammatory bowel disease. It is important to note though, that no one feature or combination of features is pathognomonic for one type of inflammatory bowel disease, namely Ulcerative Colitis (UC) or Crohn's Disease. Pathologically these two diseases differ in a variety of ways, yet they can appear similar radiologically depending on the tissue involvement and/or stage of proliferation.
     This series of radiographs demonstrates numerous small, shallow ulcerations. This is typical of UC as it is confined to the mucosal/submucosal layer. In addition, several colonic ulcers demonstrate a "collar- button" appearance. The collar-button ulcer is an erosion through a mucosal crypt with lateral extension in the submucosa. Typically this type of ulcer has a flattened base due to limited erosion into the muscle wall. Collar-button ulcers can be seen in other inflammatory conditions, such as Crohn's, amebiasis, and tuberculosis. In UC, the lateral erosion of the collar- button ulcer can coalesce with other ulcers leading to undermining of the mucosa and a denuded bowel wall.
     Another finding demonstrated in these radiographs is the presence of mucosal protrusions or "pseudopolyps". Pseudopolyps are believed to be the result of an interplay between several mechanisms. First, as the inflammatory state progresses and extensive mucosal/submucosal ulceration occurs, small islands of intact mucosa are left behind in regions of denuded bowel. Secondarily, these islands of intact mucosa became inflamed and edematous leading to the observed luminal protrusions.
     Finally, several other non-specific features of UC are noted in these radiographs. Prominent among these is the loss of normal haustral markings and marked narrowing of the left colon or a "stove pipe" appearance. These changes occur secondary to fibrosis and scaring of the bowel wall. In early, active disease, only transient loss of haustral markings can be observed. This has been explained by a hypertrophy of the muscularis mucosa with sustained contraction out of sequence with the deeper muscle layers.
     Ulcerative colitis is a process that typically begins in the ano-rectal region and proceeds proximally to the ileo-cecal region. In this patient, it is apparent that there is extensive disease occurring with the appearance of terminal ileal involvement, so called "backwash ileitis".
