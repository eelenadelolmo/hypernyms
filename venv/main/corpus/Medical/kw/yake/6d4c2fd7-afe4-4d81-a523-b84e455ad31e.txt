No physical exam findings
An enchondroma is a benign lesion.  Occasionally, it can be difficult to distinguish between enchondroma and low-grade chondrosarcoma.  However, in the absence of pain or other symptoms; and, with characteristic imaging findings - conservative management with observation is appropriate.
• Intramedullary "popcorn-like" calcifications in the left humeral shaft on the chest radiograph.  NOTE: Metallic "nipple marker" beads
• Followup MRI shows a well-defined intramedullary mass within the proximal left humerus diaphysis.  T2 hyperintense matrix with predominantly T1 isointense to slightly hypointense signal.  
• There is diffuse robust enhancement present.  Minimal endosteal scalloping is seen.  There is no cortical breakthrough or periosteal reaction to suggest an aggressive lesion.  Nor is there surrounding soft tissue component.

• Fibrous dysplasia
67 year old asymptomatic woman presented for screening chest radiograph.
Humeral shaft is a typical location of presentation, although enchondromas most commonly occur in tubular bones of the hands and feet.   Imaging features of this lesion are typical, correlating with radiographic pattern of lobulated arcs and rings.  Patient presentation is also typical, as these lesions are frequently discovered incidentally on plain radiographs, MRI, and CT scans as was the case with this patient.

This patient is older than the typical presentation, as these lesions are most commonly seen in patients who are 20-40 years of age.  However, they can be seen at any age, and there is no gender or racial predilection. 

Typical symptoms include pathologic fracture or bone pain both of which our patient did not have. Often times, patients are asymptomatic. Prognosis is usually benign and cases are managed conservatively.  Malignant transformation is extremely rare (<1%) but signs include bone scalloping, cortical thickening, periosteal reaction, bony erosion all of which can be seen on imaging.
