Altered/decreased awareness and confusion noted on PE.
Patient was hospitalized and after brief observation no change in mental status was noted.  Elective craniotomy with burr holes was performed and 2 drains were placed.  She remained hospitalized until mental status improved and serial CTs demonstrated resolution of the hematoma, pneumocephalus and hydrocephalus.
CT demonstrates several different densities suggesting different ages of previous bleeds.  Also present is a midline shift and evidence of mass effect from the hematoma.  The second image demonstrates placement of 2 drains with resolution of the midline shift.

MRI(gradiant echo)well demonstrates old vs. new blood and T1 oost-constrast image demonstrates fluid/fluid levels due to different ages of blood.
