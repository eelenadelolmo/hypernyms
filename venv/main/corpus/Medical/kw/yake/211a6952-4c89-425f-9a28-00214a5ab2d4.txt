Subpendymomas are uncommon low-grade tumors, thought (perhaps) to arise from subependymal cells called "tanycytes".  These lesions occur most often either as asymptomatic masses in the 4th ventricle - or as symptomatic masses in the lateral ventricles.

Most 4th ventricular ependymomas show some contrast enhancement; whereas most in the lateral ventricle do not enhance.
