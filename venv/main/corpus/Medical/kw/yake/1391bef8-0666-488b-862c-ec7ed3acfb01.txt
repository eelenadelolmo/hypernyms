On physical exam, she was noted to have a 1 cm firm, fixed, tender mass on the volar aspect of the proximal phalanx with a full range of motion.
Sensory examination was within normal limits.
After consideration of the treatment options, the patient elected to proceed with surgical excision.  Surgery revealed a discreet, firm, osteocartilaginous lesion on the surface of the proximal phalanx that did not communicate with the medullary canal. There was a shallow depression in the underlying cortex, correlating with the radiographic findings.  Histological evaluation revealed a lobulated fibrocartilaginous matrix with diffuse foci of ossification.  The vast majority of chondrocytes were of normal appearance; an occasional binucleate cell was found.  No mitotic figures were appreciated.  The histopathologic examination, supported by radiographic imaging and historical data, supported the diagnosis of periosteal chondroma.
Plain film examination revealed a 9mm x 5mm focal ossific lesion with a chondroid matrix. The mass was adjacent to the cortical surface of the proximal phalanx and demonstrated saucerization of the underlying bone.

MRI revealed a well demarcated lesion with a predominantly hypointense signal on both T1 and T2 weighted images, relative to skeletal muscle.  A central, linear focus of hyperintense signal was also present on T2 weighted images. The lesion did not communicate with the underlying bone or surrounding soft tissue.

This 41 y.o. woman presented to the Orthopedic clinic with a two month history of a painful mass on her left middle finger.  The patient stated that the pain interfered with her work activity; she denied any trauma.  

The patient was referred to a hand specialist for definitive treatment.	Examination 1 month later revealed decreased grip strength in addition to the findings of the initial visit.
