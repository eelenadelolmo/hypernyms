50 yo male w/ a h/o metastatic gastric cancer.
This case shows many of the classic findings associated w/ lymphangitic carcinomatosis.  With a h/o metastatic gastric cancer, increased interstitial thickening and pleural effusions on CXR, and nodular thickening of the septa and effusions on CT, these findings are consistent with lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
