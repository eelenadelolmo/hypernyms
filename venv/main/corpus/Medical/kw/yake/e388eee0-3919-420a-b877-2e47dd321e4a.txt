Frontal and lateral radiographs of the left ankle demonstrate a small longitudinal well circumscribed cortically based lytic lesion at the lateral aspect of the distal tibial metaphysis.  The lesion has sclerotic borders, somewhat scalloped inferiorly and medially, no periosteal reaction, and it has no appreciable associated soft tissue abnormality.  There is no fracture or dislocation.

Selected MRI images demonstrate the lesion is isointense to muscle on both T1 and T2 weighted images, does not demonstrate fat supression.  It shows mild uniform enhancement with gadolinium.

The soft tissues and remainder of the osseous structures are unremarkable.
Nonossifying fibroma
• Non-ossifying fibroma (strongly favored)
• Eosinophilic granuloma
• Osteoid osteoma
• Infection
