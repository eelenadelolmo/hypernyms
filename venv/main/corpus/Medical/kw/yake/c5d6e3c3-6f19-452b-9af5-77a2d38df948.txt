G0P0 female presents to the emergency room with acute onset of pelvic pain.
Hemmorhagic cysts are not an uncommon finding associated with pain.  While the more classic features of lace-like or chicken wire internal septations or a fluid-fluid level are not present in this case.  Keeping in mind a broader differential of complex cystic masses of the pelvis listed above in the differential (- ectopic pregnancies as the hCG was negative) is helpful in directing follow up.
