68 year old man with sudden visual loss right eye
The sudden loss of vision was caused by the retinal detachment, which is related to the enhancing intra-ocular mass - the uveal melanoma.  The uveal tract consists of:
iris
ciliary body
choroid (vascular)
Although there is a pigment epithelial layer in the retina, it is not the site of origin for this tumor.
