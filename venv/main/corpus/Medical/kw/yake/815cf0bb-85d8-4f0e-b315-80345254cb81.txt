62 y/o female with liver mass possibly hemangioma on CT scan for 3-phase CT scan of liver to evaluate. Pt with history of chronic Hepatitis B and is at risk for HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma).
Originally suspected hemangioma in this patient with known Hepatitis B infection and vague history of findings of mass discovered in CT performed at another institution.  SPECT imaging with TC99m-RBC for hemagioma not consistent with hemangioma.  Laboratory findings were more consistent with HCC with marked elevation of alpha feto-protein.  Follow-up imaging revealed diffuse involvement of the liver and portal vein invasion/thrombosis.
