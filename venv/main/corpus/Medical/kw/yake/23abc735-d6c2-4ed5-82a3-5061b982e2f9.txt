Surgical correction of the abdominal wall defect.
Multiple prenatal ultrasound images at gestational age of 18 w 5 d demonstrate a four-chambered heart with apex oriented left, a left-sided gastric bubble and loops of bowel herniating through an anterior abdominal wall defect positioned to the right of the umbilical cord insertion.
