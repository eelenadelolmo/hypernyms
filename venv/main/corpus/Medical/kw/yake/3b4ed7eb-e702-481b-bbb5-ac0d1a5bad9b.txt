Swelling, decreased range of motion and deformities of her fingers, wrist, ankle, and toes bilaterally with soft tissues on MCP joint.
Radiographs of hands and wrists (A/P, lateral and Norgaardâ€™s view) show subluxation of the metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal joints (PIP), ulnar deviation of metacarpal bones, periarticular osteopenia of metacarpals and proximal phalanges, and erosions of the PIP and MCP joints.  A/P and lateral films of bilateral feet demonstrate erosion at the proximal interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints and subluxation at these joints.  Flatten arch resulting from mechanical degradation of the posterior tibial tendon due to chronic cortical and cartilage erosions.
