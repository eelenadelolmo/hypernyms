First-line therapy for patients with ADPKD typically involves controlling hypertension.  Treating hypertension appears to serve two functions.  The first is to slow the rate of loss of renal function.  The second is with controlled hypertension the risk of a rupturing a  cerebral aneurysm (which these patients are predisposed to)  is decreased.   ACE Inhibitors are currently the anti-hypertensive medication of choice.  Patients that develop end-stage renal disease will ultimately need dialysis or kidney transplant.
