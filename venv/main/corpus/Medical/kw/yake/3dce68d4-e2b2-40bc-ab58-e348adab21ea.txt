Follow-up with subsequent radiographs.
Radiograph #1 : Transverse fracture at distal radius with mild dorsal displacement of distal radius 
Salter Harris Type II fracture of distal ulna with significant dorsal displacement of ulnar styloid.
Radiograph #2 : Sclerosis in area of radial fracture ~4mm.  Lucency in region of distal ulna fracture with boney bridging
Radiograph #3 and 4: 1 cm in diameter subperiosteal radiolucency proximal to healed fracture at distal radius

MRI T2 with fat sat: High signal intensity around distal radius and ulna
Post-traumatic subperiosteal hematoma and post-traumatic inflammatory change and transverse fracture
Hematoma and Transverse fracture
12 year-old male with a history of injury to his left arm.
Post traumatic subperiosteal reactions are an uncommon complication of fractures in children usually consisting of fat or blood. The cause appears to be due to subperiosteal invasion of bone-marrow fat and/or hematoma, which may be visible on radiographs during fracture consolidation of the newly formed subperiosteal bone. They are a common finding in greenstick fractures and are most commonly found in the radius, but have been reported in other areas as well including the tibia.  It has typical features on radiograph and diagnosis is confirmed by MRI â€“ this allows for differentiation from other lesions preventing unnecessary and, potentially invasive examinations.
