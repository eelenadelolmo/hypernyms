His weight is 3.085 kg, and length is 50cm. His head circumference is 39cm (99th percentile) at birth. Patient appears within normal range for height and weight, however does have macrocephaly. Patient born with Apgar scores of 9 and 9, and in-utero amniocentesis demonstrated a 46 XY karyotype.  Hematocrit is low at 44 at birth, possibly due to interventricular hemorrhage.
CPS placement was performed to reduce the hydrocephalus. Follow-up will be done to monitor reappearance of hydrocephalus or interventricular hemorrhage. Also,patient will be monitored for progression of clinical symptoms such as seizures, intellectual development delay, and motor development delay.
MRI without contrast demonstrates the dilation of the lateral ventricles, high tentorium with posterior fossa enlargement, agenesis of corpus collosum, cystic dilation of fourth ventricle, complete agensis of cerebellar vermis, and colocephaly. Obstructive hydrocephalus is present with compression of the cerebral aqueduct Also, thin bulging occipital bones are noted.

A 3 day old male infant presents with history of in-utero ultrasound evidence of Dandy Walker malformation with dilation of temporal and occipital horms, agenesis of corpus collosum, and macrocephaly. Pregnancy was complicated by alcohol use, inadequate prenatal care, and polyhyrdaminios. Now, he is being evaluated for surgical placement of a cystoperitoneal shunt(CPS) due to his extensive hydrocephalus.
There are a variety of clinical manifestions of DWM, and patients are often diagnosed in-utero with suspicion or post-natally. Within the first year of life, signs of hydrocephalus such as nystagmus, ataxia, and lethargy can become apparent. This patient was born with suspicion for DWM after fetal ultrasound was performed, and was born with prominent signs of obstructive hydrocephalus.
