Medical management involves pain control, transcutaneous nerve stimulation, and immobilization.  In advanced disease unaffected by activity modification, surgery is the only option. Core decompression with or without bone grafting can be attempted prior to any bone collapse.  Total hip arthroplasty is the next level of treatment when collapse occurs, femoral head deformities develop, or secondary osteoarthritis develops.
AP and lateral radiographs of the hips show serpiginous lines of sclerosis along the femoral heads.  There is flattening and subchondral fracture of the right lateral femoral head.  Additionally, the right femoral head is smaller than the left.

MRI imaging demonstrates areas of decreased signal intensity along the femoral heads bilaterally on T1 weighted images.  The low signal intensity on T1 weight images is consistent with edema.  On the T2 weighted images, there is an inner line of increased signal intensity with an outer line of decreased signal intensity in both hips.  This is called the “double rim” sign and is pathognomonic for avascular necrosis.  The rim identifies the interface between viable and dying bone marrow.  The high signal intensity rim is indicative of granulation tissue and the adjacent low signal intensity rim reflects cellular debris, fibrous tissue, and reactive trabecular bone.  The STIR images show linear lines of increased signal intensity along the femoral heads as well as increased signal intensity along the right femoral neck consistent with bone marrow edema.
Avascular necrosis of the femoral heads.
Compression fracture secondary to osteoporosis
Inflammatory synovitis
Osteomyelitis
Neoplastic bone lesion
Transient Osteoporosis

Causes of Avascular Necrosis:
Idiopathic, Corticosteriod use, Alcohol abuse, Sickle cell disease, Vasculitis, Trauma, Renal transplant, Renal osteodystrophy, Radiation therapy, Pancreatitis, Gout, Gaucher disease, Connective tissue diseases (SLE), Caisson disease, Metastatic disease, and Cytotoxic agents.
The patient presented with a 10 week history of bilateral hip pain.
The “double rim” sign in this case is a characteristic finding in advanced avascular necrosis.  Using Ficat’s classification, this patient has late stage 3/early stage 4 avascular necrosis of the femoral head on the right.  The flattening of the femoral head is seen in late stage 3 and early stage 4 disease.  He has stage 2 avascular necrosis on the left.  In Ficat’s classification, stage 1 is defined as a normal radiograph with clinical symptoms.  Stage 2 disease is mixed osteopenia and sclerosis.  Stage 3 is subchondral collapse with a “crescent” sign seen on radiographs.  Stage 4 is articular collapse, and stage 5 disease is progression to degenerative joint disease.
