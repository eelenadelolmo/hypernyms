Patient was diagnosed with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma.  She had a colostomy to alleviate the obstruction acutely.
Scout shows gas filled transverse colon, loops of contrast filled small bowel and paucity of gas in the right side of the abdomen.
CT images show dilated cecum, colon and small bowel.  There is propulsion of bowel contrast through the ileocecal valve mimicking intussusception.  There is omental caking with multiple peritoneal poorly defined, contrast enhancing soft tissue masses throughout the pelvis.  The uterus and ovaries are not clearly identified.  The rectum is encased by a soft tissue mass and represents the transition point in dilation of the bowel.
Colon Obstruction, Metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma
• Large bowel obstruction
• Ovarian cancer
• Colon cancer
• Endometrial cancer
• Pertoneal carcinomatosis
53 y.o. woman complaining of abdominal pain and nausea.
Bowel contrast in the setting of obstruction may be used to differentiate bowel from abscess, assess bowel wall thickness, or even to characterize bowel masses or causes for the obstruction.  It is known that oral contrast takes anywhere from 2.5 to 10 hours to reach the rectum in an obstructed individual.  In this case, the bowel contrast clearly is flowing through the ileocecal valve.  This mimics a target lesion seen in intussusception.  The patient received urgent surgery but did not have an intussusception.
