Patient will comtinue to be followed by her chiropractor and oncologist. A surgery/neurosurgery consult will likely be considered. 
Treatment of choice will likely be complete resection of the lesion. Chemotherapy and/or radiation could be added if metastatic disease is to be confirmed.
MRI of cervical spine without and with contrast: 1) 2cm osteolytic mass involving the right side of the T1 vertebral body with extension into the anterior epidural space where there is a 2cm mass on the right side extending into the right T1-2 neural foramen. Given the clinical history, the findings would be highly  suspicious for an osseous metastasis with epidural extension especially in light of the 2cm right hilar mass. 2) central C3-4 disc herniation indenting the anterior aspect of the cervical cord. 3) desiccated broad central C4-5 and C5-6 disc herniation impinging on the anterior aspect of the cervical cord. 4) desiccated broad central C6-7 disc herniation indenting the anterior aspect of the cervical cord. 

MRI of the lumbar spine without contrast: 1) severe L4-5 and severe L3-4 spinal stenosis. 2) severe bilateral L3-4, severe bilateral L4-5 and severe L5-S1 foraminal stenosis. 3) desiccated central L5-S1  disc herniation. 4) Grade 1 anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 and grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 on L5 with no evidence of spondylolysis. 

MRI of thoracic spine without contrast: 1) concentric bulging of the disc and ventral disc herniation at the T10-11 and T11-12 levels without evidence of thoracic disc herniation into the anterior epidural space or thoracic spinal stenosis or thoracic cord compression.  2) normal thoracic cord with no intramedullary lesion identified. 

PET scan: 1) suspicious area in the medial left clavicle and a single suspicious focus of hyper metabolism in the left lobe of the liver. 

MRI showed an intrdural-extradural dumbbell-shaped mass that exited the spinal canal through the neural foramen.   To confirm this patient"s diagnosis, a biopsy would likely have to be completed to determine the make-up of this paraspinal mass.
Schwannoma
1) Schwannoma
2) Neurofibroma 
2) metastasis
3) meningioma
The patient is a 70 y.o. woman with PMHx of chronic back pain and breast cancer presents after being in a MVA in August 2014. She  was transported to the trauma hospital where she complained of headaches and right shoulder and hip pain. Head,neck and spine X-rays were obtained, as well as a spine CT.  She was discharged and followed up with a chiropractor. Her continued back pain made the chiropractor order a MRI. 

Past Medical: Remote history of a T1 micNO Right breast carcinoma
status post lumpectomy and radiation therapy in 1996.

Chronic neck/back pain and the MVA prompted prompted the treating doctor of chiropractic/contributor (SC) to order the imaging studies that this patient received. The cervicothoracic lesion found on MRI appeared benign but did cause the chiropractor to refer the patient to an oncology center.  It was at this oncology center where the PET imaging was performed.   It is to the credit of contributor (SC) that after the lesion was noted, that proper referral took place.   Such imaging was performed to rule out METS.  The appearance on multiple forms of imaging suggest that cervicothoracic mass is benign.  The appearance on imaging alone suggests either a schwannoma or neurofibroma.  

Neurofibromas are tumors that forms along tissue in nerves. They are most commonly associated with genetic disorders (neurofibromatosis 1 & 2) that are usually diagnosed in childhood or early  adulthood. These tumors are most often benign but can also be malignant. Common symptoms related to neurofibromas are hearing disturbances, cardiovascular complications, nerve impingement, vision impairment, and pain (1).

Schwannomas are benign nerve sheath tumors. They are slow growing and capable of compressing nearby structures, such as nerves. Usually, they are single masses but can occur as multiples. Symptoms are often associated with pain and the structures they compress (2).  Imaging studies of schwannomas can demonstrate a dumbbell-like appearance as the tumor within the vertebral column exits through the neural foramina. 

Although a diagnosis of either neurofibroma or schwannoma based solely on imaging alone is not clear there are historical and physical examination findings that lead to the correct diagnosis.  The incidence of a spontaneous schwannoma is far greater than a spontaneous neurofibroma.  Neurofibromas are much more commonly associated with a genetic disorder such as Neurofibromatosis 1 or 2. These tumors are also more likely to arise earlier in life than is seen with this patient. For this patient, neither the history/physical examination nor imaging supports a diagnosis of either NF1 nor NF2, making a schwannoma much more likely.  Treatment of choice for schwannomas is surgical resection. 

With regard to the PET imaging the enhancing lesion in the area of the clavicle may indicate a sternoclavicular arthritis.  With regard to the enhancing region in the area of the liver such is noted and can be followed if needed by other forms of imaging.   She is going for updated mammography at the time of this publication.
