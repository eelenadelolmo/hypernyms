Physical exam demonstrated a petite female (wt 45 kg) with a low pitched inspiratory and expiratory stridor audible across the room. She was afebrile but tachypneic. 
Spirometry demonstrated complete flattening of the inspiratory and expiratory loops. 
ESR elevated at 82, HCT low at 29.4, RF elevated at 80, ANA neg, LFT's WNL, CHEM 7 WNL, proteinase 3AB c-ANCA elevated at 1.66.
Fiberoptic bronchoscopy demonstrated beefy red, erythematous, edematous subglottic trachea. Biospy was not attempted in order to protect the patients airway.  Additional labs: proteinase 3AB c-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody
(c-ANCA) was elevated to 1.66 (normal less than 0.8) and is highly specific (99%) for Wegener granulomatosis. The sinus surgery was performed at another institution and the pulmonologist is attempting to obtain the sinus specimens for re-evaluation to help confirm the diagnosis of Wegener.

The patient will receive corticosteroids and either cyclophosphamide or methotrexate. She will also receive antibiotic prophylaxis. Further interventions may include tracheal dilatation and/or direct injection of the stenotic region with steroids or mitomycin-C.
Tracheostomy may be required if her airway continues to stenose.
Image 1: AP neck radiographic demonstrates subglottic narrowing and loss of subglottic shouldering.
Image 2: Lateral neck radiograph demonstrates subglottic narrowing and posterior tracheal mucosal thickening and irregularity.
Image 3: Same as 2 with arrows and explanation.
Image 4: Axial CT demonstrates marked narrowing of the subglottic trachea with prominent paratracheal soft tissue thickening.
Image 5: Axial CT slightly lower than image 4 demonstrates a blind fistulus tract arising anterior right aspect of the subglottic trachea just inferior to the level of the stenosis.
Images 6,7: Demonstrate maxillary and ethmoidal sinus mucosal thickening.
Images 8,9: virtual bronchoscopy images demonstrate laryngeal anatomy and the area of stenosis seen below the cords.
Images 10,11: virtual bronchoscopy images slightly inferior than the prior images demonstrate the false cords, true cords, and stenotic segment.
Images 12,13: Reverse virtual bronchoscopy images (looking from the trachea toward the larynx) at the exact level of the tracheal pathology demonstrate mucosal thickening and irregularity with the opening of a fistulus tract along the right anterior trachea.

Patient presented with a 2 month history of increasing inspiratory and expiratory stridor which began after 2 separate sinus surgeries.

Pertinent history is that the patient experienced her first episode of epistaxis several years prior to surgery and had multiple subsequent clinical visits for sinusitis.

She also has a remote history of migratory arthralgias/joint effusions/fevers and ulcerative colitis (diagnosed by colonscopy).
Patient presented with a 2 month history of increasing inspiratory and expiratory stridor which began after 2 separate sinus surgeries within the past two months for chronic erosive sinusitis. During the first surgery, the patient was intubated with a cuffed 6.5mm endotracheal tube. During the second surgery, the anesthesiologist could only pass a 5mm uncuffed tube.After the surgeries she developed worsening inspiratory and expiratory stridor. 

Pertinent past history is that the patient experienced her first episode of epistaxis several years prior to surgery and had multiple subsequent clinical visits for sinusitis.  She was diagnosed with erosive chronic sinusitis, for which the surgeries were performed. She also has a remote history of migratory arthralgias/joint effusions/fevers and ulcerative colitis (diagnosed by colonscopy). 

In regards to her acute presentation, she was referred to a pediatric pulmonologist for evaluation of her stridor.

1. In retrospect, many if not all, of the patient's prior illnesses (migratory arthralgias, ulcerative colitis, and sinusits) were likely a manifestation of Wegener's.

2. Virtual bronchoscopy is an expanding technical application of raw data obtained from CT examinations. Computer "Navigator" software converts the raw data into cine-3D images which can be used to simulate bronchoscopy.  In this specific case, virtual bronchoscopy was very helpful to the pulmonologist who determined to limit his actual examination to the larynx due to the stenotic/edematous appearance of the subglottic region seen on virtual bronchoscopy. He did not want to risk further inflamation of the already critically stenotic airway. Video of the actual laryngoscopy confirmed anatomy and pathology seen with virtual images.
