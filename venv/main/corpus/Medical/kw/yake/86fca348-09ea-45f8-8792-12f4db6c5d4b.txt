Bone involvement is difficult to treat separate from overall disease.  Vitamin D and calcium supplementation may increase already elevated risk of hypercalcemia in sarcoid patients.  Systemic treatment for sarcoidosis (corticosteroids, methotrexate, etc.) may slow or even reverse bone damage.  Serial radiography of involved bones may be used to evaluate overall rogression of disease and provides non-invasive modality to assess efficacy of therapeutic interventions.
