56 year old man presented with headaches and left lower extremity weakness for two weeks.
This lesion has an appearance consistent with GBM. Spectroscopy is consistent with a tumor, showing an elevated choline level (indicating increased cellular turnover), an elevated choline/creatine ratio, and a relative decline in the N-acetyl -L-aspartate peak.  This patient is doing well at the 10 month point, an uncommonly positive response to treatment.
