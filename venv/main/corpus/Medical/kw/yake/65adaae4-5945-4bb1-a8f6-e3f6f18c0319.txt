Spinal tap negative for blood
Spinal angiography was performed to assess for dural AVF.  None was found, and the patientâ€™s symptoms persisted.

Superficial Siderosis of the CNS Meninges
Superficial Siderosis - the only question is the etiology for recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage.
68 y.o. woman with progressive hearing loss, difficulty walking, and progressive mental deterioration.
Superifical siderosis of the CNS is a result of recurrent subarachnoid or intraventricular hemorrhages (e.g. bleeding from cranial or spinal AVM's, neoplasms, post-operative manipulation).  The presenting signs include hearing loss, cerebellar dysfunction, pyramidal tract signs, and progressive mental deterioration.  Cranial nerves II, V, VII, and VIII can be involved (with nerve 8 being the most vulnerable).

Pathologically, hemosiderin and ferritin deposits in reactive macrophages are seen in the leptomeninges, subpial tissue, and on the cranial nerves. MR imaging demonstrates marked hypointensity on T2WI around the leptomeninges (particularly the pons and cerebellar vermis) and on the cranial nerves.  Hemosiderin and ferritin deposition has also been noted on the ventricular ependyma after neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage.

Some MR scan sequences, particularly "fast" spin echo studies, can cause an artfactually low signal border between the brain and adjacent subarachnoid space that should not be mistaken for this condition.

MR imaging of the spinal arteries or spinal angiography can be performed to locate a spinal AVM, one of the potential causes for this condition.
