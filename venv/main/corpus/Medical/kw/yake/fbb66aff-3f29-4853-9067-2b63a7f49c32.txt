No palpable mass, skin changes or nipple discharge.
To be determined.
Mammograms from 2002 and 2003 are negative.  An MLO projection the screening examination in 2004 shows a small area of suspicious calcifications and an associated soft tissue density not more that 6-7mm diameter.  The findings are subtle especially considering the easily identifiable mas on the ultrasound examination.  Images recorded from the ultrasound guided needle localization show an irregularly contoured hypoechoic and shadowing mass at the location of the concerning calcifications.
Invasive Lobular Breast Carcinoma
A small area (approximately 5mm) of invasive lobular carcinoma in the midst of ductal carcinoma in-situ, mostly comedo type.  The invasive component is well-differentiated, ER+, PR+, Her2 negative.  Areas of lobular carcinoma in-situ are present within the resected mass.  A sentinel lymph node was negative for malignancy.
73 y/o asymptomatic woman status post right mastectomy in 1973 for breast cancer.  No adjuvant therapy.  Two sisters with breast cancer.  The last screening mammogram performed 17 months ago was normal.
In this particular case, it was fortunate that micro calcifications were present.  These almost certainly were associated with the ductal carcinoma in-situ and they served to identify the area harboring a nearby invasive cancer. The increasing architectural distortion inferior to the calcifications is subtle.
