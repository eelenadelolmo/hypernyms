Pt was taken to OR. Incision made over TEA scar. A large amount of prurulent material bubbled out of the incision. A total of ~1 cup of necrotic/prurulent material was removed from the R. elbow. The proximal ulna had a "moth-eaten" appearance with a large sequestrum. An attempt was made to remove as much cement as possible but it was felt that the infection was not at the bone-cement interface but at the outside of the bone. The TEA was removed and good portion of the proximal ulna was resected.

The cultures form the sequestrum grew out Staph aureus. The patient will be treated with Nafcillin 2gm q4hrs x6weeks, and Rifampin 600mg PO qD x6weeks.
