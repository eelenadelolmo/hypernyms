Vital signs stable.  Hemoglobin 14.3, hematocrit 32.8.

In the emergency department, patient had altered mental status with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10.  He had a diffusely tender abdomen without guarding or rebound tenderness.  No flank ecchymoses.
The patient in this case initially had a grade V splenic laceration with contrast extravasation and a moderate amount of hemoperitoneum.  Although surgery was not initially employed since the patient was young and hemodynamically stable, conservative management later failed when patient resumed alcohol consumption after discharge and fell reinjuring his spleen.  The patient returned to the emergency department two days after discharge with a positive FAST and hypotensive.  Extensive interval hemorrhage around the spleen was shown on repeat CT of the abdomen and a splenectomy was performed for splenic rebleeding.
CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed a shattered spleen with multiple  lacerations and fractures extending through the full thickness of the spleen.  There was a moderate amount of perisplenic hemorrhage and evidence of active contrast extravasation.
