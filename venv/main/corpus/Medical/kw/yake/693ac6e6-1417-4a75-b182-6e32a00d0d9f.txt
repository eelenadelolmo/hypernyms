Skin: Laser tx for cosmesis
Glaucoma: Close follow-up with ophthalmology with goal to preserve vision and control IOP via medications and/or surgery.
Follow up imaging to track disease progression in presence of new onset of Sx, seizures, etc..
Focal cortical hypoplasia of the left occipital lobe seen with decreased T2 signal of deep white matter, along with increased enhancement of overlying leptomeninges in comparison with right.  Increased signal intensity and size of choroidal plexus noted in occipital horn of left ventricle in comparison with right.  Increased pial enhancement of left parietal lobe in comparison with right.
Left globe enlargement in comparison with right globe (measured at 2.5 cm vs 2.0 cm AP).
Sturge-Weber Syndrome
Findings consistent with known Sturge-Weber Syndrome
May consider: Wyburn-Mason Syndrome, Other phakomatoses
11 mo female with known syndrome and a recent diagnosis of glaucoma.  No history of developmental delays or seizure activity.  Procedure: Baseline MRI of brain with gadolinium for evaluation of disease progression in future.
Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) or encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis is a non-heritable congenital neurocutaneous disorder associated with vascular malformations of the leptomeninges, choroid of the eye, and skin of the face with a trigeminal distribution.  Findings are ipsilateral in the overwhelming majority of patients, but can also be bilateral.1  Pathogenesis is theorized to be associated with inappropriate control of normal vascular maturation and a resultant persistence of the primitive vascular plexus2.  Diagnosis is based on demonstration of port-wine stain in a trigeminal distribution (not pathognomonic) and leptomeningeal angiomas, although variants also occur with an absence of one of these findings in the presence of ocular angiomas.3  

The predominant ocular feature is glaucoma, with a congenital presentation seen in 50% of patients.  Early presentation in the newborn begins as bupthalmos, or enlargement of the globe.  Other ocular findings include choroidal angiomas, heterochromia of the iris, or visual field defects, such as homonymous hemianopsia, secondary to occipital cortex atrophy4.

Neurologic features are progressive and include seizures, focal deficits, and mental retardation, although it is possible to be spared neurologic abnormalities.  Typically children will have no developmental delay for several months after birth, but may begin to slow in their cognitive development as the disease progresses.  Mechanism for this progression is suggested to be secondary to hypoxic ischemia in tissues that failed to vascularize appropriately adjacent to the leptomeningeal angiomas.4  Seizures are often the presenting symptom.  Their frequency, age at onset, and response to treatment affect prognosis4.

MRI reveals the angioma as a hyperintense enhancement of the leptomeninges on T2-weighted images frequently occipital or posterior temporoparietal, with atrophy of adjacent lobe.  Choroidal angiomas enhance on fat suppressed T1 imaging.3
