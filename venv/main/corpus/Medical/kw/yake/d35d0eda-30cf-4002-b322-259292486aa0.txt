On physical exam, the ortolani maneuver was positive.
The patient was placed in a Pavlik harness, flexed at the hip, and re-evaluated by ultrasound weekly.
The alpha angle, measured between the ilium and the superior ridge of the acetabulum was 58 degrees on the left, just under the normal limit of 60.  The femoral head was only about 25% covered in the acetabulum below the normal value of 50%.
Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH)
2 week old male with family histor of hip dislocation at birth.
DDH is a congenital laxity of the ligaments at the hip.  Early detection and treatment are important as these children will not be able to walk with this abnormality.  
A pavlik harness is used to hold the infant in a flexed position.  For more severe cases or if dislocation persist, surgical correction and use of a spika cast may be necesary.
