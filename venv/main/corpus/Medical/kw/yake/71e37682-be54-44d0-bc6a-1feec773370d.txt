The bilateral collections were surgically evacuated.
Non-contrast CT of the brain demonstrates bilateral frontal subdural hemorrhages of varying chronicity.  The right collection contains some prominent areas of high density, consistent with acute on-chronic hemorrhage. The left collection also contains a small amount of high density that may also represent acute blood.  Overall, these collections are roughly symmetric in size and cause no midline shift.  There is no hydrocephaplus; the ventricular systems are smaller than expected for age, perhaps secondary to
compression by the extraaxial fluid collections.
