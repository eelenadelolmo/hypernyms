Scout: proximal partial bowel obstruction (dilated loops of small bowel with CT oral contrast in colon)
	-NGT

CT: 	Thickened segment of distal small bowel with luminal narrowing
		-Focal fatty proliferation “creeping fat”
Crohn’s Disease complicated by partial small bowel obstruction
Small bowel obstruction  in a young adult: adhesions, appendicitis, intussusception, incarcerated inguinal hernia, and malrotation.

Thickened segment of small bowel: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), infection, malignancy (lymphoma), and ischemia
Teenage (14) boy with abdominal pain and diarrhea.
Crohn’s disease is a transmural granulomatous inflammatory disease that can affect any part of the GI tract.  The peak incidence is between 20 and 40 years of age but many cases present in childhood (especially the early teenage years).  
	
Common presenting symptoms are abdominal pain and diarrhea but GI symptoms may be mild or absent.  Weight loss, growth failure, delayed puberty, or fever of unknown origin may be presenting complaint.  

The terminal ileum is involved in the majority of cases.  Most children will have involvement of the distal ileum and the right colon.  Children also can have isolated involvement of the small bowel with a normal terminal ileum or isolated colonic disease.


CT is useful to demonstrate complications such as sinuses, fistulas, abscesses, and phlegmons.  It is also able to demonstrate focal fat proliferation “creeping fat”.  CT is also effective at showing thickened bowel wall, luminal narrowing, proximal dilation, and identification of the level of bowel obstruction.


This patient responded well to conservative management.
