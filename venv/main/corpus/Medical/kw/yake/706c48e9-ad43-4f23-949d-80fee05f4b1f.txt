Patient demonstrated decreased pulses in the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedal arteries.
Patient was discharged after treatment.
Radiographic/Angiographic findings:  Diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries.  The right external iliac artery demonstrates 40-60% stenosis and the left internal iliac artery demonstrates a high grade origin stenosis.  The common femoral artery demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic disease without focal stenosis.

Patientâ€™s femoral popliteal bypass graft is patent.  There is complete occlusion of the native SFA and profunda femoris arteries.  

The proximal peroneal artery demonstrates severe stenosis.

Treatment:  Following Cryoplasty of the proximal peroneal artery with a 3 mm balloon followed by a 4 mm balloon demonstrated no residual stenosis.
Cryoplasty of femoropopliteal atherosclerotic disease
N/A
Clinical History:  74 year old with left foot pain and ankle ulcer.  Patient with past medical history of hypertension, COPD, hyperlipidaemia, and peripheral vascular disease.  Past surgical history is significant for a right below the knee amputation.
Cryoplasty serves as another treatment modality to promote a longer term of patency in peripheral vascular disease.
