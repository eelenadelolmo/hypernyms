She presented at this time for kyphoplasty to treat the pain from her L5 osteoporotic compression fracture.  After recovering from anesthesia, the patient was evaluated by the Neurology service, with no evidence of neurological deficit.  Follow-up appointment two weeks later revealed increasing left-sided sciatic symptoms.  The patient was subsequently referred to neurosurgery and underwent a hemilaminectomy and cement removal, with resolution of the sciatic pain.
Plain Radiograph (pre-procedure):  Bones are diffusely osteopenic, with moderate to severe facet and discovertebral degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine.  Transitional lumbosacral anatomy, with a compression deformity at L5. Slight retropulsion of the postero-superior endplate of L5.  Cholecystectomy clips.

CT (post-procedure): Diffuse osteopenia, diskovertebral and facet degenerative changes (including prominent Schmorlâ€™s node at L4), and L5 compression deformity again noted.  Levoconvex curvature to the lumbar spine seen on the coronal reformat. Moderate spinal stenosis secondary to facet hypertrophy, ligamentum flavum buckling, and diffuse posterior disk bulges.

Interval kyphoplasty changes, with findings consistent with balloon inflation with minimal bone cement placed in the right aspect of L5. Cement leakage into the right pedicle.  Moderate amount of cement placed into the left aspect of L5, with extrusion into the left pedicle.  Moderate amount of cement leakage intrathecally on the left, with resultant focal stenosis at this level.
