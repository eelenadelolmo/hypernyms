Periorbital edema and erythema around the right eye and orbit.
Surgery
• Mixed signal intensity mass, probably arising from the right orbital roof.  
• The lesion has some small areas - some linear - of T1-shortening suggestive of blood products or perhaps lipid material.
• There is faint peripheral rim enhancement, that may be in the surrounding tissue, or a rim of this lesion.
• No internal contrast enhancement
Dermoid cyst
• Subacute blood products - hematoma
• Atypical Lipoma
• Epidermoid tumor
• Dermoid cyst
• Mucocele of frontal sinus
• Metastatic disease
25 y.o. woman with a two day history of painful and swollen right eye.  Brought in by her spouse, she denies any history of trauma.
Due to the presentation of this patient with acute onset of periorbital swelling and edema; and, with the MRI findings - spouse abuse was as a diagnositic consideration.  In this clinical context, the MRI findings were consistent with subacute or chronic hematoma.
