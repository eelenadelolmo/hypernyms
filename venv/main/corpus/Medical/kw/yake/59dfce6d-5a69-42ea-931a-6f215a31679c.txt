Vitals: Afebrile, HR 80, RR 16, O2 Sat 99%, BP 120/74

PE: Within normal limits
Cardiac: Normal S1/S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops
Ext: No evidence of LE/generalized edema
1) Recommended Fetal Echocardiogram for further evaluation of anatomy and viscera location/orientation.  At high risk for congenital heart disease to include Transposition of the Great Vessels, Tetralogy of Fallot and Outflow Tract Anomalies.

2) Follow gestation closely with ultrasound - may require surgery to repair congenital anomalies upon birth

3) Care must be taken when labeling patients further imaging studies and during any diagnostic/invasive procedure

4) Computed tomography in the future to better assess extent of Situs Anomaly (Left vs. Right Isomerism - Cardiosplenic Heterotaxy)
1) Situs Ambiguous, Heterotaxy Cardiosplenic Syndrome, Baby B, Female, with levocardia (heart pointing towards the left) and the stomach bubble on the right.  Four-chamber view revealed no cardiac anomalies with adequate visualization right ventricular outflow tract.  Due to high risk of congenital heart disease and visceral anomalies fetal echocardiogram ordered. 

2) Dichorionic Diamniotic twin gestation with dates matching fetal size and symmetric growth

3) No distinct gross anomalies noted with Baby A
Situs Ambiguous (Heterotaxy)
1. Situs Inversus
     - Levocardia vs. Dextrocardia
2. Situs Ambiguous (Heterotaxy)
     - Left Isomerism (Polysplenic)
     - Right Isomerism (Asplenia)
3. Malrotation of the gut
4. Imaging Artifact
29-year-old caucasion female, G2P0 s/p in-vitro fertilization procedure approximately 20 weeks earlier without complication. Noted diamnionic dichorionic twins on previous ultrasound.  Referred for repeat US for date confirmation, placental location and evaluation of anatomy. No current complaints.  Patient received regular pre-natal care.
Situs refers to the position of the cardiac atria (independent of the apical direction) and associated viscera.  Solitus is the normal anatomical position of the morphologic right atria on the right, gastric bubble to the left and liver shadow on the right. Inversus refers to the mirror-image reversal of the thoracic and abdominal organs transposed through the sagittal plane.  Dextro and Levocardia involve the direction of the cardiac apex.  Situs inversus with dextrocardia or Situs Inversus Totalis is associated with a 3-5% risk of congenital heart disease with Transposition of the Great Vessels most common.  Situs inversus with Levocardia is associated with >90% risk of congenital heart defect and is increasingly rare compared to dextrocardia.  Situs inversus is present in 0.01% of the population, affects males > females (recessive trait) and is often involves polysplenia, asplenia, horshoe kidney and diaphragmatic hernia.  Totalis is associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia or Kartagener’s Syndrome (situs inversus, nasal polyposis, chronic sinusitis and bronchiectasis) in 20-25% of cases.  Secondary to impaired mucociliary clearance results in recurrent pulmonary infections with bronchiectasis most often in the lower lobes. 

Situs Ambiguous (Heterotaxy) involves the inability to completely determine the orientation of the cardiac apex and position of the morphologic atria.  Two primary dysfunctions exist – both with significant risk of congenital heart disease. Right isomerism (asplenia) involves bilateral right-sidedness with bilateral right atria, central liver, bilateral 3-lobed lungs, absent spleen and the descending aorta/IVC on the same side.  Left isomerism (polysplenic) involves bilateral left-sidedness with bilateral left atria, multiple spleens and both lungs with 2 lobes.  The IVC is often interrupted and continues with the azygos or hemiazygos veins.  Situs ambiguous cases are often challenging and require thorough CT evaluation of the viscera to follow the location and relationships of the thoracic and abdominal organs.  Care must be taken in diagnosis of intra-abdominal pathology (appendicitis/cholecystitis) and with surgical exploration due to disordered anatomic location of organs.
