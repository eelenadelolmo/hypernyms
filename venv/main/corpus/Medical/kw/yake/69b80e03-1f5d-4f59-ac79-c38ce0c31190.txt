Large concha bullosa
20 y.o. woman with headache involving the right side.  It was more retro orbital in nature - 3 years.  Headache was present throughout the day.  Patient had periods of remission during these 3 years.  Patient invariably felt better after a good sleep.
Headache was not associated with vomiting.  Patient gave no h/o head injury or seizures.  She also gave no h/o nasal block / discharge.
Concha bullosa can cause head ache by obstructing the drainage of anterior group of sinuses.  In this patient there was no radiological evidence of inflammation.  Probably headache in this patient could have been caused by stretching of infraorbital / anterior ethmoidal nerves.
