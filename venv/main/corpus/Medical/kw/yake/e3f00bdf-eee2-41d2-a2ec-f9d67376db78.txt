Complete paraplegic, without bowel or bladder control, and with a T10 and below sensory deprivation.

Clinical observation and examination confirmed the patient is currently a complete paraplegic, without bowel or bladder control, and with a T10 and below sensory deprivation.  

Intra operatively the devastation of a gunshot wound was clearly seen with a destruction of the posterior elements, the conus medullaris, and the fracture of the vertebral body.

The patient had a primary thecal sac repair required to prevent meningitis.  The patient was transferred to a spinal rehab facility.
AP and Lateral lumbar spine films as well as a follow up CT-scan were performed in order to determine the stability of the spinal cord and the condition of the thecal sac.  The films revealed a bony fragment in the thecal sac which was causing a CSF leak that the patient was asymptomatic from since he had been in the prone position since the injury. Plain films- A midline, vertically oriented nondisplaced fracture of the L1 vertebral body is noted.  A bony spicule projects into the thecal sac at the L1-L2 intervertebral disc space.  There is the suggestion of a fracture of the inferior articular facet of L1 best seen on the lateral view.  The vertebral heights and intervertebral disc spaces are well maintained.  Multiple bullet fragments.

CT-Scan- A soft tissue defect posterior to the L2 vertebral body marks the entrance site of multiple bullet fragments.  The bullet traversed the inferior articulating facet of L1 with an associated comminuted fracture of the facet.  A bony spicule is seen in the thecal sac at this level.  The spinous process and inferior articulating facet of L1 demonstrate a comminuted fracture with bullet fragments surrounding the posterior elements and within the thecal sac.  A vertically oriented fracture through the L1 vertebral body is visualized.  There is evidence of a retroperitoneal hematoma.
GSW T10 with paraplegia
17 y.o. who was shot while allegedly attempting to steal a car.  The bullet entered through the patient’s back approximately one centimeter lateral to the spinal cord and at the approximate the T12-L1 level.  The patient was taken to a local hospital where he was initially operated on to repair an isolated inferior vena cava injury.  At this point he was transferred to Walter Reed Medical Center for continued care.  Upon arrival the Neurosurgery service was consulted secondary to the patient’s paraplegia and a serosanguinous fluid that was leaking from the back wound.
The case above represents the value of obtaining CT-scans as well as plain films for evaluation of spinal cord injuries.  The fracture and bony fragments are difficult to see on the plain films.  The extent of the damage is clearly seen on the CT-scan.  The findings of a bony fragment in the thecal sac became the key to preventing the development of meningitis in a patient with a CSF leak that was asymptomatic secondary to the patient’s prone position.  It also helped to delineate what the “serosanguinous fluid” might be
	
According to Ravin’s Textbook of diagnostic Radiology, the thoracolumbar spine is the second most common site of spinal fracture with forty percent of these injuries resulting in neurologic deficits.  The deficits are caused by injuries to the conus medullaris, the cauda equine, or isolated nerve roots.  This level is also pivotal because it is the area of transition between the kyphosis of the thoracic spine and the lordosis of the lumbar spine.
	
The text confirms the use of plain film as the initial study to obtain in trauma situations but reiterates, as the case above shows, the importance of CT scan for the precise definition of injuries.
	
Clinically, according to the Current Surgical Therapeutics by Way, the management of these patients involves maintenance of the ABC’s, methylprednisolone if spinal shock is suspected, and surgical stabilization and decompression as required.  Additionally the patient with a thoracolumbar injury would be kept in the neutral position.  
	
In conclusion, the case presented above delineates the use of CT vs. plain film to provide the precise definition of damage in spinal cord trauma as well its clinical importance.
