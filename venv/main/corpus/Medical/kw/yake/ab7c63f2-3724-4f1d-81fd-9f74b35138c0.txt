Texto: 
1) Bronchoscopy (Pre Angiography) - Pulsatile blood flow identified localized to LUL, 150-200 cc volume. Mucosa nodular and erythematous. (Total volume of witnessed hemoptysis in 24 hours - @ 300 cc).

2) Intraop bronchoscopy (Post Angiography) - LUL bleed confirmed. 

3) PHYSICAL EXAM:
Afebrile. BP 121/70, HR 80, RR 15-24, PO2 92% RA 97% on 2L NC.
Skin: Posterior neck cutaneous lesions c/w sarcoid.
Lungs: Fine bibasilar crackles.
Heart: RRR. 

4) LABS:
HCT: 29. Coags normal. AFB smear x 2 - Negative. ACE level - elevated. Otherwise unremarkable.
BRONCHIAL ARTERIOGRAM:
1) The T3-T8 left intercostal arteries are selectively injected. No left intercostal bronchial trunks are identified. At the T3-T4 level there is backfilling of two bronchial arteries - (1) right and (1) left. The left takes off the aorta directly and the right takes off an intercostal. No other bronchial arteries are definitively identified using thoracic aortography. The visualized bronchial arteries are normal caliber. There is no evidence of hypervascularity. There is no blush of contrast or parenchymal stain associated with these vessels. There is no angiographic evidence of a bleed source.
Bronchial Arteriography for Hemoptysis
Hemoptysis:
1) Chronic bronchitis
2) TB
3) Malignancy
4) Other pulmonary cavitary disease (Fungal disease, Cavitary sarcoid) 
5) Pulmonary hemorrhagic disorders (Goodpastures Syndrome)
6) Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis
7) Collagen Vasc Disease (SLE, PAN)
8) Vasculitides (Wegeners, Behcets, Hypersensitivity vasculitis)
9) Pulmonary embolism
10) Pulmonary edema
46 year old AA female with a history of pulmonary and cutaneous sarcoid admitted with recent dyspnea on exertion and large hemoptysis. Intermittent small volume hemoptysis over the last month in the context of a concomitant URI. Admitted for escalating hemoptysis with possible respiratory compromise.
See Factoid. Patient specific discussion is under 'Patient information'. No nonbronchial systemic collaterals evaluated.
