Dual-energy PA and subtraction soft-tissue-selective radiographs demonstrates nodular, irregular pleural thickening involving the right upper and mid peripheral lung fields.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is noted.  

Dual-energy PA subtraction bone-selective radiograph exhibits no areas of abnormal calcification within the region of pleural thickening.

Lateral chest radiograph demonstrates nodular pleural thickening involving the right upper lung margin, and a small pleural effusion is noted.

When compared to the chest radiograph from 3.5 months prior, this area of nodular, irregular pleural thickening, and right pleural effusion is relatively new.

Contrast enhanced axial CT images through various levels of the chest demonstrate a unilateral right sided pleural effusion, with mildly enhancing circumferential, nodular, irregular thickened pleura, encasing the right hemithorax with a rindlike appearance.  Additionally, there is focal nodularity of the mediastinal pleura.  There is no significant adenopathy, nor evidence of a chest wall abnormality

An 82-year-old female with productive cough and chest pain.
The biopsy specimenâ€™s immunoprofile was as follows:

Cytokeratin - Positive
Vimentin - Positive
S-100 - Focally positive
Smooth Muscle Actin - Negative
Calretinin - Negative

This immunoprofile, along with the morphologic features seen on HE stained sections, are consistent with a poorly differentiated non-small cell lung carcinoma.
