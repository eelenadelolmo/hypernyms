Childhood polio and post-polio surgical corrective procedures
Initial considerations include conditions causing growth plate injury and growth arrest, such as Ollier's disease, multiple osteochondromas, polio, infection, radiation, cerebral palsy, spina bifida, trauma. Many of these can be excluded owing to lack of associated findings.
