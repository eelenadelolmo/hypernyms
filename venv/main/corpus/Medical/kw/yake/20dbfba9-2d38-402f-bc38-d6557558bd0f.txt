Texto: 
Tenderness over proximal right thigh. 
Otherwise unremarkable.
Osteotomy and bone grafting.
Plain radiographs of the left femur demonstrates an osteolytic lesion originating within the medullary cavity of the proximal femoral diaphysis.  There are internal lobulated ridges with associated thinning of the cortex and osseous expansion.

CT axial image through the lesion demonstrates “fatty” low attenuation characteristic of a lipoma.
Intraosseous Lipoma
1. Fibrous dysplasia
2. Metastasis
3. Hyperparathyroid brown tumor
56 y.o. male presented to primary care physician with right thigh pain.
The differential diagnosis of osteolytic lesions can be divided into those that occur in patients younger than 30 years of age, versus those seen in older patients.  In the younger age group, one must consider Eosinophilic Granuloma, Non-Ossifying Fibroma (if eccentric, metaphseal lesion with scerotic border), Aneurysmal Bone Cyst (if aneurysmal), and Solitary Bone Cyst.  An eosinophilic granuloma has many appearances and hence, must appear in the differential diagnosis of any lytic lesion in patients younger than age 30.  NOF’s typically occur in the metaphysis of a long bone, emanating from the cortex.  They classically have a thin sclerotic border that is scalloped and slightly expansile.  ABC’s occur anywhere in the skeleton and are also expansile.  Solitary bone cysts usually occur in long bones beginning at the physeal plate and grow into the shaft.  Solitary Bone cysts are central in location.

In patients older than 30 years of age, one must consider Fibrous Dysplasia, Metastasis, and Hyperparathyroidism.  Fibrous dysplasia is a benign congenital process that can be seen in patients of all ages and unfortunately can look like almost any pathological process radiographically.  Metastasis also has a variable appearance and thus, at times appears benign radiographically.  Lastly hyperparathyroidism when considered must have other signs radiographically i.e. subperiosteal bone resorption at the radial aspect of the middle phalanges.
