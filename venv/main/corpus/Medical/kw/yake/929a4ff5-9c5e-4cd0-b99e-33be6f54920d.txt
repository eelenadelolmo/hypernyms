Gross abnormality of the left hand; severe pain.
Surgical reduction and internal fixation.
Fractures through both the scaphoid and the triquetrum. Ventral dislocation of the lunate with respect to the capitate. Radiolunate articulation remains intact. "Pie-Shaped" lunate on the AP view secondary to the volar tilt and foreshortening.
Perilunate dislocation
Perilunate Fracture Dislocation
Lunate Dislocation
Fell off motorcycle, landed on outstretched left hand.
Falling on an outstretched hand can can result in fracutes of the distal radius and/or carpal bones, with subsequent carpal ligamentous rupture and subseqeuent dorsal dislocation of the capitate on the lunate.  Depending on the force of injury, the lunate can undergo such volar displacement force to dislocate from the radial head articulation-- a true lunate dislocation.  This is a less common ocurrence; perilunate dislocations, or commonly fracture-dislocations are approximately twice as likely to occur.  The scaphoid is the most frequent carpal bone fractured, with the triquetrum also common.  Fracture of the lunate is uncommon.  Treatment is surgical, and can be often followed by chronic carpal instability leading to early arthritic changes.
