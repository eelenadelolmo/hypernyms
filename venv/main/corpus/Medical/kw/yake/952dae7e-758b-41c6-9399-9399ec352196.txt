Esophageal Foreign Body - Coin Ingestion
• Esophageal Foreign Body
• Tracheal Foreign Body
• External Attenuator
10-month-old girl gagged on something last night.  The patient's mother says the little girl is feeling well, but is more 'fussy'.  No symptoms of respiratory distress.
Although the appearance on the frontal image is classic for a coin ingestion with esophageal localization, 2 views are necessary to confirm and determine that coin is not in the trachea, nor external to the patient.
