HEENT: Normal. Oropharynx is clear. Neck supple with no lymphadenopathy.
Lungs: CTAB

Abd: Distended but nontender. +BS.  Palpation c/w large firm mass filling right side of the abdomen and extending below the umbilicus. Lower edge of mass is palpable about the level of the anterior iliac spine. 
GU: Only superficial visual inspection of perineal region. Normal female genitalia with no labial edema or obvious rash. 
Ext: No C/C/E
Neuro: CN 2-12 intact, reflexes symmetric. Normal gait.
Skin: No lesions or rashes.   
SOFT TISSUE, RIGHT RENAL MASS, BIOPSIES:  Tissue suboptimal for definitive evaluation. Small round blue cell neoplasm. Unable to evaluate the architecture of the neoplasm. Immunostains for vimentin, LCA, synaptophysin and chromogranin all appear negative while keratin appears weakly positive. The differential diagnosis includes Wilms tumor, clear cell sarcoma, or other small round blue cell neoplasm, although the negative immunostains would seem to exclude neuroblastoma, lymphoma and Ewing's sarcoma.
This patient was initially given captopril at a dose of 0.2mg/kg BID to keep her BP at a target range of 100-110/70. She was thought to have tumor-induced hypertension that would improve with chemotherapy.
CT in the axial plane demonstrates a heterogeneous mass in the right kidney, with considerable mass effect. The liver and IVC are markedly compressed with no obvious invasion. Initial measurements of this mass were 15.4 cm in the craniocaudal dimension, 12.3 cm in the AP dimension, and 7.7 cm in the lateral dimension. The left kidney is normal with no evidence of masses or hydronephrosis. 

Coronal and sagittal reconstruction views demonstrate a well-circumscribed mass that has most likely infiltrated the right renal capsule. Cystic regions within the mass are most notable on the sagittal view. The lateral image shows medial displacement of functioning right renal parenchyma (i.e., claw sign) with contrast excretion, and there is normal excretion from the left kidney. The right adrenal gland and right renal vein are not well visualized. 

Followup CT after 5 weeks of preoperative chemotherapy shows considerable tumor shrinkage and more defined areas of margination. The tumor now measures 10.5 cm in the craniocaudal dimension, 8 cm in the AP dimension, and 5.2 cm in the lateral dimension. The right renal vein is not well visualized.

Sedated abdominal U/S demonstrates no right renal vein thrombus, although there is considerable mass effect and tortuosity of the right renal vein. The IVC is clearly visualized with no evidence of intraluminal thrombus. Flow is seen throughout the lumen.

This 2.5-year-old girl presented to her pediatrician in Italy after her parents noted a prominence in the right abdomen after bathing her in March 2004. The child had consistently been at the fifth percentile for growth up to that point. An ultrasound in Italy revealed a 7 x 8cm abdominal mass, and she was immediately air-evac’d to WRAMC for further evaluation and treatment.
Wilms’ tumor is the most common renal tumor of childhood, with a peak incidence at 3-4 years of age. It is thought to be due to abnormal proliferation of the metanephric blastema, without normal differentiation into tubules and glomeruli. Wilms’ tumors are histologically heterogeneous, comprised of three cell types in varying distributions: blastemal cells, stromal cells, and epithelial cells. While each of these components is variable in its level of differentiation, anaplasia (either focal or diffuse) is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Nephroblastomatosis is characterized by the presence of multiple nephrogenic rests, which are foci of abnormally present renal blastemal cells. It is thought to be a precursor of Wilms’, as the presence of intralobular nephrogenic rests has been associated with the development of WT.

Grossly, WT is an intrarenal mass with both solid and cystic components. Although it distorts the anatomy of the collecting ducts, it rarely grows into the renal pelvis, ureter, or bladder. If invasion of the collecting system occurs, a patient may present with hematuria and/or obstruction. The tumor is usually surrounded by a pseudocapsule. It may contain areas of necrosis, which lead to hemorrhage and the appearance of cystic structures. True cysts may also be seen. Extension of the tumor mass into the corresponding renal vein is seen in about 40% of cases, and is associated with a higher incidence of surgical complications. Extension into the IVC is associated with a 40% rate of surgical complications. Large tumors that involve vital structures are associated with a higher rate of surgical complications, most notably tumor rupture which could then lead to recurrence. They are considered inoperable without preoperative chemotherapy.

Radiologically, WT may be confused with congenital mesoblastic nephroma, in the first year of life. A mesoblastic nephroma is a solitary hamartoma which consists of immature renal stromal cells. It lacks blastemal cells and neoplastic metanephric elements, making it easy to differentiate from WT pathologically. However, it is a unilateral, single, solid mass arising from the kidney that may appear heterogeneous with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage on ultrasound and/or CT. Unlike WT, mesoblastic nephroma tends to infiltrate the renal parenchyma and does not form a pseudocapsule. It is more prominent in neonates, with a peak age at diagnosis of 3.5 months; however, isolated cases of mesoblastic nephroma in childhood and adulthood have been documented. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy increase the chances for overall morbidity, while excision alone results in cure.

The National Wilms’ Tumor Study Group (NWTSG) recommends surgical staging of every case with the following breakdown:
Stage I: The tumor is isolated to the kidney and has been excised completely.
Stage II: The tumor had extended beyond the kidney but is excised completely. Capsular penetration, renal vein involvement, and renal sinus involvement may be found. Biopsy of the tumor results in some local spill.
Stage III: There is residual non-hematogenous tumor s/p resection, but it is confined to the abdomen. The resected specimen may have histologically positive margins, or part of the tumor has infiltrated the abdominal cavity. Lymph node findings are positive and/or peritoneal implants are found.    
Stage IV: Hematogenous or lymph node metastasis has occurred outside the abdomen or pelvis. 
Stage V: There is bilateral renal involvement at the time of diagnosis. Each side is assigned a stage from I to III, and histology is based on biopsy findings. 
Postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy are based on surgical staging and follow the guidelines of the NWTSG:
Stage I with favorable or unfavorable histology OR Stage II with favorable histology:
- Nephrectomy
- Postoperative chemotherapy with vincristine and actinomycin D (18 week course)
Stage II with focal anaplasia OR Stage III with favorable histology or focal anaplasia:
- Nephrectomy
- Abdominal irradiation (1080 cGy)
- Chemotherapy with vincristine, actinomycin D, and doxorubicin (24 week course)
Stage IV with favorable histology or focal anaplasia: 
- Nephrectomy
- Abdominal irradiation according to local stage 
- Bilateral pulmonary irradiation and PCP prophylaxis 
- Chemotherapy with vincristine, actinomycin D, and doxorubicin (24 week course)
Stage II through Stage IV with diffuse anaplasia:
- Nephrectomy
- Abdominal irradiation
- Whole lung irradiation 
- Chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide (24 week course)
