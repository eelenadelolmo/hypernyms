Unresponsive, unknown Glasgow coma scale
immobilization until definitive surgical fixation
odontoid view: lateral masses do not align with C-2
Lateral views: subtle linear fracture lines of C-1 are barely discernible. Soft tissue changes anteriorly are seen.
Jefferson Fracture C1; incidental Dens Type II fracture
n/a
25 yo male, in coma after MVA
typical mechanism of axial loading in MVA resulted in the Jefferson (burst) fracture. Enough force during impact resulted also in fracture of the dens of C-2, more difficult to see in these images.
