ADDENDUM:  Following biopsy obtained after this case was originally submitted to MEDPIX, histology revealed a diagnosis of ganglioneuroma.
Frontal and lateral views of the chest show a mass which, on the frontal view, is at the right paramediastinal area and shows very clearly demarcated convex lateral margin.  The aortic edge and right paratracheal stripe are preserved, suggesting a posterior location of the mass.  No peripheral lung changes are present.  On lateral view, very subtle increased opacity is seen over the upper thoracic spine.

Selected axial CT images of the chest show a non-aggressive appearing cystic mass at the posterior mediastinum on the right side, consistent with congenital respiratory cyst.  Other etiologies to consider would be enteric cyst and neurogenic cyst.
