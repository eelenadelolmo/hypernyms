An 8 month old male presented to the ED with a 2 week history of fever, cough, increased hoarseness, increased work of breathing, and decreased po intake. The patient was taking Amoxicillin for otitis media,  without an improvement of his symptoms.
Epiglottitis is not commonly seen since the advent of the Haemophilus influenza vaccine.  However, this patient was susceptible to the disease secondary to being immunocompromised because of his AML.  Once his AML was identified and treated, the patient had a good recovery and prognosis.
