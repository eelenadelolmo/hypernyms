Midline sagital image demonstrates gyri ending in a lobular configuration to the region where the corpus collosum should be present, a finding referred to as Probst bundles.  The axial images demonstrate culpocephaly - dilatation to the posterior lateral ventricles, especially the atrial regions.  There is also a more parallel orientation of the lateral ventricles.  The third ventricle communicates superiorly with the interhemispheric fissure.
Agenesis of the corpus callosum
