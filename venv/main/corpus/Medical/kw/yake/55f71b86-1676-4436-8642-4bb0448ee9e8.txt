Treatment may include local resection if mechanical problems limit the patient.  If malignant degeneration to chondrosarcoma is present, wide excision is therapy of choice. 5 year survival 75%. Tumor recurrence may be due to spill at time of biopsy or resection (chondrosarcoma can be easily implanted in soft tissues as it does not need a blood supply to survive).
Bilateral distal femurs and tibiae with multiple hook-like bony projections directed away from the knee joint. Lesions have cortical and medullary continuity with adjacent bone, and no evidence of aggressive features.
Multiple Hereditary Exostosis
Multiple Hereditary Exostosis
Routine follow-up.
Growth of osteochondromas should halt when normal ossification ceases at adjacent physis. Findings suggestive of malignant transformation include: continued growth of osteochondroma after closure of nearby physis., changing appearance of calcifications in cap, irregular outline of osteochondroma, bony destruction at neck of lesion.  Challenge to diagnose prior to physeal closure (variable cartilage cap configuration).
