Physical exam and laboratory work up was unremarkable.
Lesion was surgically resected.  Patient obtained post surgical MRI of the brain to evaluate for complete removal.
On CT there is a 3.0 cm extra axial mass in the left occipital region.  It is oval and heterogeneous in appearance with a hyperdense rim.  The lesion is benign appearing, and causes remodeling of the overlying bone as opposed to erosion.

On MRI, there is a soft tissue mass centered at the level of the inner table of the calvarium of the left occipital bone with slightly heterogeneous signal characteristics.  It is predominantly isointense to gray matter on T1, with slightly increased signal on T2.

Post gadolinium administration there is mild enhancement of the underlying dura without evidence of enhancement of the mass itself.

61-year old retired white male presented to the emergency room with the complaint of seizures.
Epidermoid cysts of the skull are rare accounting for less than 2% of the intracranial/cranial tumors.  Approximately 25% occur in the skull while 75% are intradural.  They are thought to occur as a result of inclusion of epithelial cells during closure of the neural tube between the third and fifth week of gestation.
The majority (90%) are symptomatic.  Patients can present with enlarging scalp mass, pain and/or headaches.  Less often epidermoid cysts are incidental findings.  This patient presented with seizures, most likely resulting from hemorrhage of the epidermoid.  

On MRI imaging, epidermoid cysts are typically hyperintense on T2W with variable signal characteristics on T1.  High signal characteristics on T1W, may be due to the presence of blood products, fat or protein.  This epidermoid was heterogeneous in appearance as a result of hemorrhage into the lesion.  Lack of enhancement after contrast is the general rule, although sometimes very mild contrast enhancement can be seen around the rim of the lesion.  They are isointense to CSF on one or more MR pulse sequences, but in the majority of cases differ from CSF on DWI images.  This helps differentiate it from an arachnoid cyst.
