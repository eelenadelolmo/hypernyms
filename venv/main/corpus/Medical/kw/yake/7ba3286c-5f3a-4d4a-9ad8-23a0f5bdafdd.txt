The patient was admitted to the hospital and continued to deteriorate clinically.  A bedside echocardiogram demonstrated right-sided heart failure.  Interventional radiology was consulted, and catheter directed thrombolysis was attempted.  Shortly thereafter in the medical intensive care unit, the patient went into pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and shortly expired after unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
Contrast enhanced CT images from a PE/DVT CT protocol reveal large intraluminal filling defects in the right and left main pulmonary arteries.  Notice the enlarged main pulmonary artery.
