Texto: 
Frontal and lateral radiographs demonstrate speckled calcifications centrally within the proximal right tibial diaphysis.

MR images demonstrate a 4.2 x 1.9 x 2.0cm lesion within the medullary cavity of the proximal right tibial diaphysis which abuts the adjacent cortex without evidence of endosteal scalloping.  The lesion demonstrates intense increased signal on the T2w and IR images, with speckled areas of low signal corresponding to calcifications visualized on radiographs.  The lesion enhances following administration of gadolinium.  The adjacent marrow is unremarkable.  The surrounding soft tissue and fibula are unremarkable.
Enchondroma.  Pathologic proof.
