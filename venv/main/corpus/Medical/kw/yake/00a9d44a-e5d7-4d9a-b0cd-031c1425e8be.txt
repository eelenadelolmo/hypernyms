Texto: 
Discrete 2 to 4 mm red to violaceous papules on the right lower extremity. Some were flat-topped and others had fine white scale. There were skip areas of normal skin between the lesions, and overall they exhibited a Blaschkoian distribution. The nails and mouth were clear of lesions, and no similar lesions were noted anywhere else on the body.
The patient was given topical clobetasol ointment to apply to the lesions twice per day for two weeks, followed by tacrolimus 0.1% ointment twice per day after the two-week point. Subsequent phone conversations with the patient revealed that the pain and burning have decreased significantly, and the lesions themselves also appear to be resolving.
Hepatitis panel was negative for types A, B and C.

Histopathology: The biopsy shows hyperkeratosis, focal hypergranulosis, mild acanthosis, and a lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate. Max-Joseph spaces, basal layer alteration, and cytoid bodies are also present.
Case 3, (27th Annual Uniformed Serivces Dermatology Seminar, 2003) LINEAR LICHEN PLANUS
54 year-old white female with an eight month history of red papules that started in her right popliteal region and progressively spread in a linear pattern to involve her right lower extremity from the buttocks to the ankle. The lesions were painful with occasional pruritus and burning sensations. She had a past history of herpes zoster, though never on the lower extremities, and she denied any preceding vesicles to the papules. Her long term medications included alendronate, estrogen, cyclobenzaprine, and amitriptyline, none of which were started immediately preceding the onset of the lesion.
