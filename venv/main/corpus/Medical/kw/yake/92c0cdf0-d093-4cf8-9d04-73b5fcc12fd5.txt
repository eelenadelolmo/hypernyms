Physical exam reveals a young male, growth 85th percentile, with a distended abdomen, 1+ edema bilaterally, secondary hair (axillary, pubic, and mid-upper back), symmetrical genital enlargement, and mild facial acne.

Labs: CBC was within normal limits. Serum alpha-fetoprotein was negative.

Abdominal imaging was ordered.
The adrenal gland was resected.  No metastases were evident at the time of surgery.  The resected specimen weighed 215 grams.  On sectioning there were focal areas of hemorrhage and necrosis.  Histological examination revealed prominent cellular pleomorphism with enlarged atypical nuclei.  Occasional mitotic figures were present.  There was no capsular or vascular invasion.
There is a large homogeneous and rounded mass in the location of the left adrenal gland.
Adrenocortical neoplasm, intermediate risk
• Adrenal neoplasm
• Kidney mass
• Lymph node
3 y.o. boy was brought to the pediatric clinic by his parents because of an enlarging abdomen and an increasing feeling of fullness over the past 6 months.
The distinction between an adrenal adenoma and carcinoma in children is difficult.  Microscopic capsular invasion, cellular pleomorphism, mitotic rate and necrosis are histological features used in adults. No single histological feature has clearly emerged that allows differentiation of an adenoma from a carcinoma in children other than the presence of metastatic disease. 

Adrenocortical neoplasms (ACNs) in children have been stratified into 3 groups based on tumor weight, invasion and metastatic disease. These criteria can be used to predict clinical behavior.   Any cortical neoplasm confined to the adrenal gland and weighing less than 200 grams is low risk.  Any cortical neoplasm confined to the adrenal gland and weighing between 200 and 400 grams, or any cortical neoplasm weighing less than 400 grams with microscopic invasion into surrounding soft tissues, completely resected, and no evidence of metastatic spread are considered intermediate risk.  Any cortical neoplasm weighing in excess of 400 grams or with direct gross invasion into adjacent organs like the liver, spleen, or kidney or with metastatic spread is high risk. (1, 2, 3)

Several different imaging modalities are available for the diagnosis of ACNs – CT scans, sonograms, and MRIs. (7, 8).  However, when evaluating an ACNs MRI may be the preferred modality for many reasons. MRI differentiates between malignant and benign adrenal masses with a sensitivity = 89%, specificity = 99%, and accuracy = 93.9% (Positive predictive value = 90.9% and negative predictive value = 94.2%) (7).  ACNs commonly extend into the inferior vena cava and right atrium – MRI and CT scan are more reliable at detecting this than ultrasound (8). MRI also has the following advantages over CT scans – lack of ionizing radiation, capability of imaging multiple planes and improved tissue contrast and differentiation (7, 8).  Also, according to Ribiero et al, MRI may discriminate between benign and malignant lesions – possibly by identifying areas of necrosis or hemorrhage.
