Renal AMLs may safely be followed at this size.
Gray-scale sonographic images of the right kidney demonstrate a well circumscribed 1 cm hyperechoic lesion in the lower pole that is isoechoic with the renal sinus.

Unenhanced CT of the kidneys was obtained demonstrating a tiny focal area of fat density in the lower pole of the right kidney, confirming the diagnosis of renal angiomyolipoma.
Renal Angiomyolipoma
Differential diagnosis for a hyperechoic, apparently solid renal lesion on ultasound:

Renal Angiomyolipoma

Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)

Other renal neoplasms (eg, oncocytoma)

Complex renal cysts

Renal hematoma or abscess

Renal angiomyolipomas are typically circumscribed and hyperechoic on ultrasound, but these finding are not entirely specific.  The presence of macroscopic fat on CT or MR is virtually pathognomonic for the diagnosis of AML.


Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) may also appear hyperechoic on  ultrasound.  To distinguish a RCC from an AML, the presence of a peripheral hypoechoic rim surrounding an echogenic solid lesion, as well as demonstrable cystic elements strongly suggests a RCC.  Additionally, RCC typically lacks an acoustic shadow, whereas 20%-30% of AMLs have a varied degree of posterior shadowing.

Oncocytoma is classically hypo- to iso- echoic, but may have a hyperechoic central scar.

Deep Cortical Scar:
Deep Cortical Scars are filled with crystals and perinephric fat, producing a color Doppler ring down artifact not seen with AML.

Renal cysts complicated by hemmorrhage or proteinaceous debris may be hyperechoic, but often demonstrate enhanced through transmission.

Blood products and the contents of abscesses may also be hyperechoic, but typically these lesions are not as sharply defined.  They may also assume a subcapsular configuration.

Renal Hemangioma:
Renal Hemangioma demonstrates variable echogenecity.  In some cases, renal hemangiomas are hyperechoic, similar to liver hemangiomas, or they may appear isoechoic to renal parenchyma.
