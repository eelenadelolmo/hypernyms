CT of the chest w/o contrast shows bilateral pleural effusions with  right greater than left and adjacent atelectasis. There are multiple rounded pulmonary nodules in both lungs predominant in the right with focal cavitations. There is also diffuse groundglass opacity and septal thickening in the left upper lobe extending into the left lower lobe. The nodules in the left lung are predominantly in the peripheral left lower lobe.

Pt has a personal history significant for opioid drug abuse and depression.  Family history is significant for diabetes and coronary artery disease.
