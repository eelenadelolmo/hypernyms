• This patient was not premature and usually hepatoblastomas present in premature infants.  
• Only 20% of cases have elevated liver transaminases along with an elevated AFP (alpha-feto-protein).  
• Tumor calcifications  are seen in only 30-50% of cases, this patient did not have any calcifications.  
• Only one-third of patients have a tumor with suitable size and location so that complete excision can be attempted.
