Normal physical examination.
No post-treatment images are available.
Lateral scout view for head CT shows enlarged sella. Non-contrast head CT demonstrates large sellar/suprasellar mass. The heterogenous lesion is seen clearly in the contrast-enhanced MR study.
Pituitary Macroadenoma
Differential diagnosis includes craniopharyngioma, meningioma, abscess, metastasis, and aneurysm.
38 y/o otherwise healthy male with three week h/o headaches.
The enlargement of the sella without erosion suggests a slow-growing mass. Mass effect would probably have caused more symptoms in the near future such as visual disturbances and hydrocephalus (due to compression of the Foramen of Munro).
