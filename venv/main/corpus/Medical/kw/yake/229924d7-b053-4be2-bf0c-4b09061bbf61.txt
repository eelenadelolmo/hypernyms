Patient originally sent to ultrasound because uterus was believed to be enlarged on physical exam.
Ultrasound of the left adenexa demonstrates a 5 X 1.5 CM tubular anechoic structure adjacent to the left ovary. Original ultrasound of 8 weeks prior demonstrated what was thought to be a 2.7 cm left ovarian cyst.
Hydrosalpinx
1. Hydrosalpinx
2. Cystic ovarian or para-ovarian neoplasm
If internal debris is present add:
3. Tubo-ovarian abscess  
4. Endometrioma 
5. Pyosalpinx/Salpingitis
40 year old female sent to ultrasound to follow-up on an ovarian cyst visualized 8 weeks prior.
There are multiple causes of hydrosalpinx. The most common causes are infectious/inflammatory sequella from pelvic inflammatory disease and STDs (common organisms are Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, TB). 

Other causes are previous ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth (infections post-partum), abortions, IUD placement, congenital causes, endometriosis, previous abdominal surgeries causing adhesions, and abdominal inflammatory conditions such as appendicitis and diverticulitis.

When internal debris is present within a hydrosalpinx, concern should be present for active infection (pyosalpinx/salpingitis).

It is well known that hydrosalpinx is a common cause of inftertility in female patients. As it is often asymptomatic, hydrosalpinx is often initially discovered during routing infertility evaluations.

A complication of salpingitis/PID is perihepatitis and right upper quadrant pain. This condition is termed Fitz-Hugh-Curtis Syndrome.
