CT is ordered.
The mass was excised and patient recovered without recurrence.
Fig. 1 Coronal T1-weighted MR image which shows the well-defined, fairly homogeneous mass which is slightly hypointense to the adjacent liver (red arrow). Note also the curvilinear dark structures near the interface between the mass and the liver. These are flow voids from large vessels (yellow arrows).
Fig. 2: This coronal T2-weighted image shows the well-circumscribed mass is slightly hyperintense to liver and the central scar is hyperintense (yellow arrows), whereas the scar was hypointense on the T1-weighted image.
Fig. 3: A sagittal post contrast T1-weighted image was obtained in the delayed phase. The mass is now isointense to liver (red arrows) but the scar is enhancing (yellow arrow). Enhancement on delayed MR differentiates the FNH from fibrolamellar carcinoma, a form of HCC.
Fig. 4 Mass is resected. Note the well demarcated margin surrounding the tumor (red arrows), and the fibrous branching scar (yellow arrows). The parenchyma is a tan color, lighter than the adjacent liver, even in situ.
FNH - Focal Nodular Hyperplasia
• Focal Nodular Hyperplasia
• Choliangiocarcinoma
• Hepatic Adenoma
• Cavernous Hemangioma
• Fibrolamellar carcinoma
