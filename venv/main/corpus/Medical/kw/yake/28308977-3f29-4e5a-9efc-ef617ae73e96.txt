Texto: 
No specific areas of tenderness. No abnormalities reported on range of motion. Questionable palpable nodule/ganglion radial aspect of wrist. No labs drawn.
No treatment needed except conservative therapy for pain. A hunt for other associated abnormalities could be done.
Left hand plain radiograph: partial fusion capitate-hamate, fusion lunate-triquetrum. Normal bony mineralization. Joint spaces preserved. No fracture or soft tissue abnormalities

MR: Confirmed plain film findings. No nodule or ganglion or soft tissue abnormality was identified
Congenital Carpal Fusion
Carpal Fusion
Several weeks history of left wrist pain. No reported trauma. Otherwise in good health, on no medications.
Symptoms and signs are usually entirely lacking with pain being the more common complaint of those symptomatic. Symptomatic patients usually have partial coalitions and cystic changes in the adjacent bones.  Risk of fracture exists in the presence of a fused carpus.  Fusion between bones of the proximal and distal carpal rows or between the carpal bones and radius or ulna generally is associated with additional malformations to include: tarsal coalition or one of a variety of congenital syndromes, such as acrocephalosyndactyly syndrome, arthrogryposis, diastrophic dwarfism, Ellisâ€“van Creveld syndrome, hand-foot-uterus syndrome, Holt-Oram syndrome, otopalatodigital syndrome, Turner's syndrome, or symphalangism. 

The cause of the carpal fusion is a segmentation failure of the primitive cartilaginous canals and absence of joint formation. The osseous centers of the involved carpus coalesce at variable ages, usually between 6 and 15 years of age.
