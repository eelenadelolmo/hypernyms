Non-contributary
CT, MR, and 3-D Vitrea reconstructed images demostrate multiple herotopic exostosi of the plevis.  They are contguous with the meduallary canal.  There a cartilagenous rim <3mm.  No pathalogic fractures are vizualized.
MULTIPLE HEREDITARY EXOSTOSES
22 year old male complains of right hip pain.  No history of trauma.
This case demonstrates multiple pedunculated, fungated, frond-like, heterotopic osseous lesions that are contiguous with the medullary canal.  There is internal chondroid matrix with fatty attenuation. There is no significant soft tissue component or evidence of a pathological fracture.  Common sites involved are the metaphyses of long bones near the epiphyseal plate of the knee, elbow, scapula, pelvis, and ribs.  In this case, the sacrum, pelvis, and bilateral femurs are involved.  The meduallary continuity, no evidence of pathalogic fractures and the cartilaginous cap less 3 mm indicate non-malignant osseous chondromas.  The 3-D Vitrea imaging was performed to help with the pre-operative visualization of the lesions.
