Asymptomatic right-sided abdominal mass.
6 weeks of neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprised of Vincristine, Dactinomycin, Doxorubicin (DD4A) followed by right nephrectomy.
• Initial study:
- Large right-sided renal mass (12.2cm AP x 10.6cm Trans x 14.1cm CC). Predominantly hypodense w/ areas of heterogeneity.  Possible cystic degeneration along superior border.
- Classic “claw sign” demonstrating renal origination.
- Significant mass effect on liver, pancreas, and inferior vena cava.
- Non-opacification of right renal vein and mass effect on IVC limit evaluation for tumor thrombosis.
- Right lower lobe ground glass opacity (3mm x 5mm).  DDX includes metastatic, atelectasis, or infection.

• After 6 weeks Doxorubicin (DD4A) therapy:
- Decrease in right renal mass size (7.3cm AP x 8.4cm Trans x 11.7cm CC).
- Increased calcification and heterogenicity of mass.
- Continued mass effect on liver, adjacent IVC, and right renal vein.
- IVC and right renal vein grossly patent.
- Resolution of previously noted right lower lobe lung mass.
- Internal reproductive organs within normal limits for age.
Wilms Tumor
• Wilms Tumor
• Neuroblastoma
• Multilocular Cystic Nephroma
• Mesoblastic nephroma
• Renal cell carcinoma
30 month old girl with right-sided abdominal mass.
This case demonstrates the classic "claw sign" expected for tumor originating from the kidney.  Also demonstrated the significant mass effect that Wilms tumors can have on intra-abdominal organs and vessels.  Finally, benefits on neoadjuvant therapy was appreciated with decreased tumor burden prior to tumor removal.
