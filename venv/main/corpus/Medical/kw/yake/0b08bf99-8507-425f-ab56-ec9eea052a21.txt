No cardiomegaly.  Significant alteration of mediastinal contours secondary to severe pectus excavatum which indents the heart and displaces the heart to the left side of the thorax.  Aortic root dilatation. Some scoliotic curvature of the upper thoracic spine.  Lungs are borderline hyperexpanded and clear.  No air space consolidation or effusions.
Marfan's Syndrome
>>Homocysteinuria
>>Mitral valvel prolapse syndrome
>>Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome
28 y.o. male with Marfan's syndrome.  Aortic root 5.5cm by echocardiography on 28 June.  On 21 July, by CT, the aortic root was 5.3cm at the level of the coronary arteries then tapering off to 3.5cm.  There was no evidence of involvement of the desceding aorta or great vessels.  Also noted by CT was a moderate pectus excavatum deformity compressing the atria and right ventricle and displacing the heart to the left.  MRI done on 03 Aug showed the aortic root dilatation to be 6.7cm with no other changes.  The patient was scheduled for aortic valve replacement in beginning of December.
This is a 28yo active duty man who has gone undiagnosed all of his life.  Upon the initial work-up for his suspected Marfan's, an aortic root dilatation that met the criteria for prophylactic valve replacement was found.  It is important to always keep your eyese open for the supposed rare diseases particularly those like Marfan Syndrome, that would benefit greatly from early diagnosis and managemen.t
