No visible abnormality of the eyelid/puncta/eye/orbit; no visible obstruction in the nasopharynx
Therapeutic dilation of duct
Mild narrowing in the region of the valve of Krause
Nasolacrimal duct stenosis at the level of the Valve of Krause
Congential nasolacrimal duct stenosis
Acquired nasolacrimal duct stenosis
Chronic overflow of tears from right orbit
Acquired nasolacrimal drainage obstructions may be related to infection (numerous bacterial/viral/parasitic causes), inflammation/scarring (Wegener's granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, radiation), medications (chemotherapy), congenital narrowing, tumors (SCC), or trauma.  Occasionally, small nasolacrimal duct stones may be found blocking the duct.

Of interest, the use of I(131) for thyroid carcinoma is associated with a an overall 4.6% incidence of documented or suspected obstruction.  

The cause of the narrowing in our patient was unknown.
