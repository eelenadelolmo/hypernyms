Physical exam was significant for a fib with distant heart sounds.
Treatment was achieved by surgical evacuation of pericardial effusion.
PA and lateral Chest X-ray:  An enlarged cardiac sillouette is demonstrated with a water-bottle shape.  On the lateral view, a density following the border of the heart is seen anteriorly next to a lucent margin. 

Chest CT:  A large pericardial effusion is demonstrated with anterior parietal pericardial thickness maximally 2 mm without pericardial enhancement.
Pericardial effusion, possibly Dressler's syndrome.
The differential for findings seen on CXR include pericardial effusion, dilated cardiomyopathy, CHF, and aortic dissection.

The differential causes for pericardial effusion include infectious, autoimmune, neoplastic, drug induced, metabolic, sarcoidosis, pancreatitis, and trauma
76 YO male presented with LE swelling and pain.  Pt had MI and PTCA 3 months prior and had been SOB since that time for which he was treated with increasing doses of lasix for presumed CHF without relief.  Pt was also on Coumadin for chronic atrial fibrillation with INR in therapeutic range.
A pericardial effusion is an increase in fluid within the space between the visceral and parietal pericardium.  It is the most common abnormality of the pericardium.  Normally, 20cc of fluid is within this space, but 200cc is needed for identification on plain film which is demonstated by thickening of the pericardial stripe greater than 2-3mm or differential density sign. The differential density sign is the lucent margin along the lateral or posterior heart border seen in 63% of pericardial effusions.  Although this sign is more sensitive than the thickened pericardial stripe seen in 15% of patients with pericardial effusions, it is less specific.  Plain film also demonstrates a water-bottle configuration of the cardiac sillouette.

Other modalities can also detect pericardial effusions.  Echocardiography can detect effusions less than 50cc usually posteriorly, less than 100cc anteriorly and posteriorly, greater than 100cc around the entire ventricle.  CT can detect loculated pericardial effusions.  MR demonstrates a pericardial stripe >4mm and will have a better characterization of the pericardial fluid.  

Dressler’s syndrome consists of a pleural effusion and pericardial effusion developing about 2–8 weeks after acute myocardial infarction. Pericardial effusion may be serous or serosanguinous, and although rare, it can cause cardiac tamponade.
