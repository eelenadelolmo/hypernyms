1. Flow images demonstrate hyperemia of the soft tissues of the right lower extremity.

2. Blood pool images demonstrate increased radiotracer accumulation in a curvilinear fashion in the lateral soft tissue of the right distal residual limb.

3. Delayed images of the lower extremities demonstrate a corresponding area of increased radiotracer accumulation in a curvilinear fashion in the lateral soft tissue of the right distal residual limb.

4. Plain radiograph of the right residual limb confirms the heterotopic ossification.
