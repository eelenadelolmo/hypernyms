Follow up chest radiographs in four to six weeks following appropriate treatment to document resolution.
PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate an  airspace opacity within the right mid lung field, seen on both views. This silouettes the right heart border on the frontal radiograph.  There is no pneumothorax and no pleural effusion.  The pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.
Right Middle Lobe Pneumonia
RML Infection (pneumonia)
RML Aspiration
RML Collapse
Focal pulmonary edema
Contusion
Infarction
Neoplasm
Fever and cough for several days.
Notice how the right heart border is "silhouetted" by the  air-space disease in the right middle lobe (RML).  This occurs because the RML partially overlaps the heart.
