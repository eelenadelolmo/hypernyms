This eleven year old girl has scoliosis and is complaining of low back pain.
Osteoid osteoma is a benign skeletal neoplasm of unknown etiology. The tumor consists of an ovoid or spherical nidus of osteoid-rich tissue and interconnected bone trabeculae superimposed on a background of highly vascularized connective tissue containing large dilated vascular channels.The average size of the nidus is approximately 1.5 cm, but its size can be 0.5-2 cm.  The tumor is usually smaller than 1.5 cm in diameter. Osteoid osteoma can occur in any bone, but in approximately two thirds of patients, the appendicular skeleton is involved. The skull and facial bones are involved exceptionally.

Osteoid osteoma more commonly affects males than females. The male-to-female ratio is 2:1.Most patients with osteoid osteoma are young with three quarters of patients are aged 10-30 years,and more than 90% of patients are aged 5-25 years.

The classic presentation includes focal skeletal bone pain, which worsens at night and is frequently relieved with a small dose of aspirin. Pain that increases with activity and at night occurs in 95% of patients with spinal tumors. In 29% of patients, the pain is severe enough to waken the patient. The site of involvement may be tender to touch or pressure. Constitutional symptoms are usually absent.

When the spinal column is involved, muscle spasms may cause abnormal alignment. A painful scoliosis may be concave toward the lesion. The onset of scoliosis may be acute and is frequently initiated by physical exertion. Osteoid osteoma has been called the most common cause of painful scoliosis.

Radiography is the initial examination of choice and may be the only examination required. The lesion initially appears as a small sclerotic bone island within a circular lucent defect. This central nidus is seldom larger than 1.5 cm in diameter, and it may be associated with considerable overlying cortical and endosteal bone sclerosis. CT is used for precise localization. MRI is a useful imaging technique, but CT appears superior for precise localization. Radionuclide scanning for technetium-99m diphosphonate uptake shows fairly intense activity at the tumor site. Radionuclide scanning is a sensitive technique, and findings may be positive before radiographic changes are apparent.

For the treatment of osteoid osteoma surgery, conservative treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and radiofrequency ablation are potential options. Surgery is frequently associated with major morbidity and a prolonged period of recovery. Longterm drug therapy may result in gastrointestinal side effects and is not well tolerated by patients. Percutaneous RF ablation is performed under CT guidance by using general or spinal anesthesia.24 After localization of the nidus with 1- to 3-mm CT sections, an osseous access is established with either a 2-mm coaxial drill system or an 11-gauge Jamshidi needle. Radiofrequency ablation is performed at 90°C for 4-5 minutes by using a rigid RF electrode with a 1-mm diameter. The procedure is successful when the electrode is heated to the desired temperature within the nidus. In one series, clinical success was achieved in 96% of patients. All recurrences were treated with a second procedure, with a secondary success rate of 100%.
