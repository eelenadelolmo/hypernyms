WBC = 15.2 (78% segmented neutrophils)
Surgical excision.
9mm diameter of appendix with surrounding fat stranding and thickening of bowel at origin of appendix.  Free fluid is also visible in dependent portion of pelvis, likely associated with inflammation at appendix.  No evident perforation.
Appendicitis
DIFFERENTIAL (inflamed bowel in the right lower quadrant)
•Acute Appendicitis (confirmed in this case by a thickened and non filling appendix)
•Right sided diverticulitis
•Colon cancer (may demonstrate prominent inflammatory change if perforated)
•Typhlitis (colitis in neutropenic patients)
•Infectious colitis/enteritis (CMV, TB, Yersinia)
•Inflammatory bowel disease (particularly Crohn's disease)
•Ischemic colitis (typically without signifcant pericolonic inflammation)
•Appendiceal tumors (e.g., carcinoid or adenocarcinoma; generally the degree of appendiceal dilation is greater in such cases)
54 yo female with 2 day history of right lower quadrant pain, now with nausea and vomiting.
This case demonstrates pronounced, focal thickening of the cecum about the appendiceal orifice, or "cecal apical thickening", which has a reported sensitivity 69% and specificity of 98% in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  

In addition, there is a triangular collection of intraluminal contrast material with it's apex directed into the occluded origin of the appendix, the so called "arrowhead" sign. (23% sensitivity and 100% specificity for appendicitis)

When a shelf of thickened cecal tissue seperates intraluminal contrast material in the cecum from a dense appendicolith in the proximal appendix, the term "cecal bar" is employed (10% sensitivity and 100% specificity for appendicitis) 

In many of the other conditions listed in the differential (e.g., infectious, ischemic or neutropenic coliits), cecal thickening would be expected to be more diffuse and circumferential.
