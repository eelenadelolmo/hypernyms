Total contact cast for several months with frequent cast changes.
There is pes planus deformity. There is subluxation at the talonavicular joint. Subluxation is also noted at the talocalcaneal, calcaneocuboid and cubometatarsal joints. 

There is severe hallux valgus deformity of the great toe. 

A Freiberg infraction is noted at the head of the second metatarsal. There are no periosteal reaction.

31 year-old woman with a history of uncontrolled diabetes and prior left BKA presents with right foot and ankle pain. She reports multiple ulcers of her right foot and recurrent foot pain.  Prior x-rays have noted right foot deformity and osteomyelitis.
This patient’s history of poorly controlled diabetes, prior foot ulcers, foot pain and lower extremity swelling describes a clinical picture of joint neuropathy. The imaging studies from today and prior visits have noted foot deformities without healing. More so, the imaging studies and clinical symptoms are most consistent with Charcot’s Neuroarthropathy of the foot and ankle. 

Charcot neuroarthoropahty is a progressive, noninfectious, destructive disease of the bones and joints in persons with sensory neuropathy. The disease can affect any joint, but most commonly seen in the joints of the foot and ankle. Causes include alcoholism, leprosy, tabes dorsalis, myelomenignocele and congenital insensitivity to pain. The most common cause in developed countries is diabetes. Patients with type 1 diabetes commonly present in the fifth decade after an average duration of diabetes of 20-24 years. Where as type 2 diabetic patients present more commonly with charcot nueuropathy  in the sixth decade after 5-9 years with the disease. Charcot nueroarthorpathy is seen in approximately 0.1-2.5% of diabetic patients, but it is largely believed that the occurrence is on the rise. Bilateral disease is seen in approxametely 10% of patients with a recurrence rate of less than 5%.

There is little understanding of the disease process of charcot’s arthopathy, but three theories have been hypothesized. The nuerotraumatic theory is associated with exaggerated overuse injury causing microtrauma or a single traumatic event in an insensate joint that leads to Charcot deformities. The neurovascular theory proposes that the autonomic dysfunction causes an increase in arteriovenous shunting leading to increased blood flow. Thus, amplifying bone resorption and weakening. The last theory involves the escalation of osteoclast cells due to the action of inflammatory cytokines. The literatures now suggest that charcot arthorpathy is most likely due from a combination of the three described theories. 

The clinical presentation of Charcot arthropathy can vary widely depending on the stage of the disease. Acute Charoct nueroarthropathy of the foot and ankle presents with one or more of the following symptoms: swelling, an increase in local skin temperature (3-7°), erythema, joint effusion and an insensate foot. The majority of patients will have mild to moderate foot pain and some will have associated foot ulcers. Patients may report to clinic following a traumatic event, but most patients are unable to identify an event causing foot trauma. On physical exam the patient will have dependent rubor, bounding pulses and passive motion of the foot/ankle may reveal a “loose bag of bones.” The acute presentation of Charcot arthropathy is similar to the clinical presentation of osteomylitis and cellulitis. These conditions must be ruled out by the clinical physician and with the use radiographic imaging and labs. 

There are several ways to stage the disease process of Charcot’s arthropathy. Two of theses classifications will be discussed here. The Eichenholtz classification is four stages that combine the physical exam and radiographic findings to guide treatment. Stage 0 is a patient presenting with acute Charcot nueroarthropathy as described above, but with normal radiographs. Stage 1 is the fragmentation or dissolution phase in which there will be similar physical exam findings as in stage 0, but plain radiographs will show osteopenia, periarticular fragmentation and subluxation or dislocation of the joints. Stage 2 is the coalescence phase describing the early healing phase. There is less swelling, but plain radiographs demonstrate absorption of debris, fusion of bony fragments and early sclerosis. Stage 3 is the reconstruction phase with no inflammation and stable joints on physical exam. At this stage, the plain radiographs exhibit joint arthrosis, osteophytes, and subchondral sclerosis. 

The Bodsky anatomic classification of the Charcot foot stages the specific pattern of collapse. Type 1, the most common, involves the collapse of the tarsometatarsal joint. This deformity can cause a fixed rocker-bottom foot with valgus angulation. Type 2 collapse affects the subtalar and Chopart joints. Type 3 collapse involves the ankle joint. This type of collapse is more likely to cause recurrent ulceration and osteomyelitis over the malleoli.

Traditionally, serial plain radiographs are used to follow the progression of Charcot arthropathy. Futher imaging is warranted if there is clinical suspicion for osteomyelitis. A three phase Tc-99m methylene diphosponate scintigraphy, followed by indium In-111-labeled leukocyte scintigraphy, has been found to have a sensitivity of 93% to 100% and a specificity of approximately 80% for osteomyelitis. MRI has been found to be less specific for osteomyelitis.  With this said, MRI was found to be most helpful in recognizing Charcot arthropathy during stage 0 when there are normal plain radiographs. MRI is useful in identifying bone marrow edema and stress bone injury prior to any abnormalities can be seen on plain radiographs.  

The management and treatment of Charcot arthopathy varies on the degree of progression and severity. The classification systems, like the ones described above, provide treatment protocols for different stages of the disease process and joint locations. It is important to recognize that every patient will heal differently, so the clinical physician must vary treatment protocols as needed. Conservative management is the primary goal in the management of Charcot arthopathy. Immobilization is the mainstay of the treatment. A total-contact cast is the most widely used method for immobilization with frequent cast changes to reduce complications. Following removal of a cast, life long protection of the foot and ankle is provided by specialized foot braces and shoes. Operative management is avoided in most cases, but is used in approximately 25% of cases. There is only a little amount of literature to support the different types of surgery to correct Charcot arthropathy. A surgeon will consider internal fixation, external fixation, exostectomy and/or arthrodesis with the hopes of preventing infection, recurrent ulcerations, instability and the need for an amputation. Other methods of treatment are under investigation. Those include pharmacologic treatment such as bisphosphonates and calitonin, low-intensity ultrasound and electrical stimulation. 

The prognosis for charcot arthorpathy is more favorable for those with immediate diagnosis and treatment. Outcomes are more encouraging for forefoot arthropathies than those of the midfoot, hindfoot or ankle. The healing process is prolonged by ulcers, infection and the need for operative intervention. A patient suffering from a non-complicated Charcot arthropathy, in general, will recover in 1-2 years if there is a timely diagnosis, appropriate immobilization and long-term preventative measures are undertaken.
