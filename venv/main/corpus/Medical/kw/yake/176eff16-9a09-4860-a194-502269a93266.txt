Patient has an enlarged, hard right testicle on physical exam.  Laboratory data is significant for an alpha fetoprotein of 44.8 and a HCG of 700.4
Treatment for primary malignant testicular neoplasms includes orchiectomy followed by radiation therapy.  Patient underwent staging ct of the chest abdomen and pelvis, and will continue to have laboratory, as well as, imaging follow up.
The left testicle is normal in size and echotexture.  The right testicle is grossly abnormal.  It is greatly enlarged, measuring approximately 7cm in greatest dimension.  The right testicle is largely replaced by a complex mass lesion.  This mass shows areas of both increased and decreased echogenicity and appears multilobulated.  Only a thin mantle of normal
remaining tissue is noted at the superior aspect of the right testicle. 

Blood flow is greatly increased throughout the right testicle.

Patient is a 26-year old active duty soldier who presented with a painless, enlarging "rock hard" right testicle.  Patient first noticed his symptoms beginning two months prior to presentation.
The patient is a 26-year active duty male who presented with a 2-month history of an enlarging, hard right testicle.  With this history and the patient's age, an ultrasound examination must be performed ASAP to rule out a primary testicular neoplasm.  Laboratory work up was performed which revealed elevated alpha fetoprotein and HCG.  The ultrasound demonstrated an intratesticular mass, which is considered to be mailgnant until proven otherwise.  Generally, the majority of intratesticular masses will be malignant while the majority of extratesticular masses are benign.  The patient underwent an orchiectomy the evening of these findings.  Pathological evaluation demonstrated a mixed germ cell tumor.  Compared with pure seminomas these are more radioresistant to therapy.  Staging CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was negative for any other lesions.
