Renal insufficiency
Bladder resection.
Sonography demonstrated bilateral hydronephrosis resulting in suspicion of distal obstruction.  CT of the pelvis demonstrates asymmetric thickening of the posterior (trigone) wall of the bladder resulting in obstruction of both ureteral orifices.
Transitional Cell Carcinoma of the Bladder resulting in Bilateral Hydronephrosis
Neoplastic causes:
transitional cell cancer
squamous cell cancer
adenocarcinoma
leiomyoma 
paraganglioma
fibroepithial polyps
nephrogenic adenomas 
neurofibromas
haratomas

Non-neoplastic causes of infection or extrinsic processes: perivesical inflammation from diverticulitis or appendicitis;  Crohn's disease; pelvic inflammatory disease;  cystitis cystica with recurrent UTI; cytitis glandularis; malakoplakia.
65 year old hispanic man presents with bilateral flank pain and acute renal insufficiency.  Screening ultrasound performed demonstrates bilateral hydronephrosis.  Distal obstruction is suspected, leading to CT of the pelvis demonstrating tumor along the trigone region of the bladder, obstructing both ureteral orifices.
Tumor invading the trigone (posterior central bladder wall) at ureteral insertion resulting in obstruction of both ureters.  If bilateral hydronephrosis is seen, suspicion should be high for retroperitoneal or pelvic etiology.
