Vital signs are normal.  Physical examination is normal except for slightly enlarged prostate, without nodularity.  Urinalysis was positive for few red blood cells.  PSA was 2 (normal 0-4) and cytologic evaluation of the urine was negative for malignant cells and positive for many reactive appearing urothelial cells.
Under most situations however, they are asymptomatic and not clinically significant.  Surgical removal is the treatment of a symptomatic bladder diverticulum.  This may be done from entirely within the bladder in certain situations, but often requires dissection both inside and outside of the bladder.  This surgery may be somewhat difficult because of the inflammation of a chronically infected diverticulum.
Small, contrast filled diverticulum extending from the left lateral aspect of the urinary bladder.
