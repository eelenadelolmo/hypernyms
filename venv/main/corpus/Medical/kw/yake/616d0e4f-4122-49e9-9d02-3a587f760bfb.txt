Notable for firm, fixed palpable mass over ulnar aspect of left 5th middle phalanx.  Lesion was mildly tender to palpation without erythema, warmth, or ecchymosis.
- No treatment required if asymptomatic, as the lesion is benign.
- If the patient is symptomatic (pain or compromised function), definitive treatment is by surgical excision with wide margin to minimize recurrence.
- Bone scan should be obtained before excision; increased uptake correlates with likelihood of recurrence.
Antero-posterior and oblique radiographs show a well-marginated area of ossification arising from the cortical surface of the ulnar aspect of the 5th middle phalanx.  There is no disruption of the cortex and no communication with the medullary canal of the underlying bone.

Bizarre Parosteal Osteochondromatous Proliferation (BPOP)
24 y.o. man presents with mildly painful, hard lump on ulnar surface of left 5th digit.  Patient reports traumatic event 4 weeks before clinic visit when he dropped weights on this finger.
BPOP is a benign lesion occasionally associated with a traumatic event, although this is not a requirement for diagnsosis.  Any age group may be affected with equal distribution between men and women.  It occurs most frequently in the bones of the hands and feet.  It is characterized radiographically by a well-demarcated mass of heterotopic ossification arising from but not disrupting the cortical bone to which it is attached.  There is no medullary continuity, a feature that separates it from the osteochondroma.  Histologically, the mass is composed of a poorly organized heterogeneous mixture of hyaline cartilage and immature bone.
