Initial head CT demonstrates hyperdense subdural hemorrhage along the right convexity and effacement of sulci and loss of gray-white differentiation of the right cerebrum indicative of diffuse edema. MR shows subdural blood with signal characteristics of extracellular methemoglobin anterior to both frontal lobes and along the tentorium cerebelli on the right. There is restricted diffusion in the right cerebrum due to acute infarction. Frontal radiograph of the ribs shows bilateral lateral acute fractures of the lower ribs, also seen on CT images through the lower chest/upper abdomen. The later CT image shows callus formation in the anterolater lateral ribs bilaterally. The CT through the kidneys shows delayed tubular transit time and excretion on the left which could be due to trauma.
