Editors note: 

MDCT angiography is just as diagnostic as conventional angiography for many vascular diseases.  However, at this time (September 10, 2006) many surgeons still request a confirmatory conventional angiogram prior to performing surgery.  

Such requests are understandable because radiological technological advancements are outpacing clinical experience.  It is hard to convince experienced surgeons that current MDCT technology is equivalent to conventional angiography because there are no prospective randomized trials to hold a high as proof of this reality.  

However, in a case of acute bowel ischemia secondary to embolism such as this, a radiologist should stand firm and insist that MDCT angiography is diagnostic.  Obtaining a conventional angiogram, especially after hours, can delay a definitive surgery for hours.

In addition, a conventional angiogram is an additional invasive procedure and will necessitate administering at least another 50 cc of potentially nephrotoxic contrast media.

Additional contrast use was especially dangerous in this patient because of the severe renal atrophy seen on the initial CT.
