CN V and VII neuropathies.
Mildly evlevated serum Ca++ and ACE.
CSF studies negative for infection.
Resolution of neurologic symptoms and dramatic resolution of CNS imaging findings with steroid therapy.
Initial unenhanced head CT shows abnormal high density along the ambient cistern.  Follow-up brain MRI shows high T2 signal in the hippocampal and mesial temporal regions with nodular leptomeningeal enhancement along the basal cisterns, tentorium, and sylvian sulcus.  Chest x-ray shows hilar and right paratracial adenopathy with a mixed air space and interstial pattern, predominately lower lobe.  Chest CT more clearly defines those findings showing scattered regions of ground-glass opacity with scattered interstial changes, somewhat nodular in the hilar regions, suggesting a peribroncial-vascular distribution.  More confluent areas of atlectasis and consolidation are present in the lung bases.  Abdominal CT shows bilateral low attenuation infiltrative renal lesions, some central, some extending to the cortex, without alteration of renal contour or surrounding inflammatory change.  Scrotal ultrasound shows a solitary intratesticular low echogenicity mass without increased blood flow.

Previously healthy 24 year old presented with cranial nerve neuralgia.  Initial imaging with unenhanced head CT lead to MRI of the brain.  This lead to a further imaging workup, chest x-ray, CT chest, abdomen, pelvis.  Subsequently, a testicular mass was palpated, leading to a scrotal ultrasound.
