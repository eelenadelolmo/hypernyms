Therapy is primarily medical although some believe medically refractory seizures may be cured with resection.
Well defined rounded supracellar solid mass that appears to arise from or near the floor of the third ventricle.  This mass is non-enhancing and isointense to gray matter on T1WI and slightly hyperintense to gray matter on T2WI.
Hypothalamic Hamartoma
Grade II astrocytoma
Sarcoidosis and other Granulomatous Diseases i.e. TB
Arachnoid Cyst
Teratoma or other Germ Cell Tumors
Craniopharyngioma
Hypothalamic Hamartoma
Metastasis
Optic Glioma
EG/Langerhans cell Histiocytosis

Supracellar masses in children can be separated with some degree of certainty based on their imaging characteristics.  Further more, clinical signs and symptoms further help in the differentiation process.  Grade II astrocytoma may be the most difficult to exclude with high signal on PD and no enhancement.  Sarcodoisis and TB were unlikely because of the lack of other intracranial and extracranial findings and the low clinical suspicion.  An Arachnoid Cyst was unlikely because this was a solid mass by MR characteristics.  A germ cell tumor such as an epidermoid was unlikely because those tumors tend to be lobulated, irregular, and appear similar to CSF on imaging.  Dermoid tumors usually appear similar to fat and hence would be hyperintense on T1 weighted sequences.  
An entirely solid craniophayrngioma was unlikely based on the lack of enhancement and the fact that most of those tumors are multilobulated.  Metastasis was unlikely based on clinical presentation and the non-aggressive appearance of the tumor.  A Grade I (pilocytic) astrocytoma of the optic chiasm or hypothalamus was unlikely based on the fact that those tumors are hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2, typically heterogeneous with large cystic and solid components, and enhance markedly. Lastly Langerhans cell Histiocytosis was unlikely because this process thickens the infundibulum which markedly enhances with contrast administration.
