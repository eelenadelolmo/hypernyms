Laparoscopic Heller myotomy with partial fundoplication is a safe, effective treatment for achalasia.  The partial fundoplication decreases the incidence of postoperative reflux.  The treatment is considered first line for many patients, but can also be used when nonsurgical treatments fail.  Nonsurgical treatment includes botox injections, pneumatic dilation and calcium channel blockers.  This patient underwent Heller myotomy with fundoplication.
