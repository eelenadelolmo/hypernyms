A repeat study was recommended.  The patient was instructed (again) on the importance of not exercising for 2 days prior to the study.
Diffusely increased uptake in the skeletal muscles, especially in the hands, forearms, and shoulders, consistent with recent exercise (i.e. yard work).  Note the asymmetric appearance to the soft tissues of the neck, consistent with history of radical neck dissection.  Asymmetric uptake is observed in the region of the splenius capitis muscles in the neck, likely the result of asymmetric strain following surgery.
