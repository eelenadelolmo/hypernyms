The lesion is palpable.
Diagnostic mammography, ultrasound and ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration were initially performed.
The breast lesion grew rapidly and the patient returned to her surgeon 2 months later.  Photographs were taken at that time and core biopsy performed. No malignancy was noted.  Two weeks later and excisional biopsy was performed and epitheliod angiosarcoma was discovered.
The mammogram shows skin thickening of the inner breast and mild interstitial edema.  No mass.
Ultrasound revealed a vague 5mm hypoechoic mass with abnormal vascularity.  The FNA was nondiagnostic due to inadequate sampling.  Clinical referral was made.
Breast Angiosarcoma, post-irradiation with metastasis
Angiosarcoma
Benign vascular abnormality (hemangioma)
Hematoma
Left Breast CA diagnosed 4 years prior and treated with lumpectomy, axillary lymph node dissection and radiation.  Enlarging, linear, nodular painless left breast lesion at 9 o'clock noticed after minor trauma to this area. Persistent mild purplish discoloration.
Two weeks after excisional biopsy of the left breast angiosarcoma a left mastectomy was performed.  At the time of surgery, a small similar lesion of the inner right breast was noted and a small excision performed. This, too, proved to be angiosarcoma.  A CT scan performed prior to the mastectomy, shows a larger nodule deep to the area of right breast biopsy that is of unknown significance at present.
