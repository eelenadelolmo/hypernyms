Noncontributory.
N/A
AP and lateral radiographs of the lumbar spine show nonvisualization of the left L2 pedicle and diffuse sclerosis of the cortex of the right-sided pedicle at that level. These findings are visualized to better advantage on the magnified image. 

Two contiguous axial CT images through the L2 vertebra, viewed in bone windows, demonstrate absence of the left pedicle at L2, compatible with congenital absence of the pedicle. Note the absence of an aggressive-appearing osteolytic lesion to account for this finding.
Congenital absence of a pedicle
The combination of radiographic and CT findings are pathognomonic and are important because they distinguish this case from that of a pedicle missing secondary to an osteolytic skeletal lesion - such as a metastasis.
