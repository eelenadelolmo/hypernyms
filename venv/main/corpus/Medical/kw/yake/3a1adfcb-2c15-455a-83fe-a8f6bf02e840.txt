Dilated and non-reactive left pupil
The patient underwent craniotomy and evacuation of the left-sided hematoma.  After recovery there was a persistent right-sided epidural hematoma.  Because of the left occipital infarction (secondary to compression of the PCA by uncal herniation) she has a persistent visual field defect.
• Large left frontal epidural hematoma
• Rightward subfalcine herniation with left uncal herniation.
• Small right parietal epidural hematoma.
• Large left subgaleal hematoma (scalp hematoma).
• Small medial left occipital lobe bland infarct.
• No calvarial fracture (by report)
Bilateral Epidural Hematoma, Herniation, PCA infarct
• Spontaneous parenchymal bleed
• Traumatic Epidural hematoma
• Traumatic Subdural hematoma
An 11 y.o. girl with sickle cell anemia was admitted with abdominal pain and joint pain.  She was treated for a painful SCA crisis.  Subsequently, she was "found down" and unresponsive.  There was no known head trauma.
Thi case is unusual for several reasons.  She had a left frontal epidural hematoma and smaller right-sided hematoma - resulting in subfalcine and downward trans-tentorial herniation with secondary left occipital infarct.

This is an unusual case of epidural hematoma in that there was no reported history of trauma.  An epidural hematoma associated with an ipsilateral subgaleal hematoma implies a common mechanism, that is, blunt trauma.  It is possible un-witnessed or unreported trauma occurred.  

The usual etiology for an epidural hematoma, laceration of a meningeal artery, is unlikely in the absence of a skull fracture, however, raising suspicion for an unusual etiology.

A second unusual feature is the presence of a second, contralateral hematoma.  Additionally, when the hematoma was evacuated, the surgeons encountered an unusual amount of bleeding and were forced to transfuse blood products to achieve hemostasis.  

One interesting imaging feature of this case is that the larger hematoma crosses the midline anteriorly.  This feature can be helpful in more subtle cases to distinguish epidural from subdural hematomas.  Supratentorial subdural hematomas do not cross the midline because they are blocked by the falx.  Note, however, that epidural hematomas rarely cross the midline where it coincides with the sagittal suture.  This is because epidural hematomas are subperiosteal; the outermost layer of the dura mater is the periosteum, which is adherent to the calvarium at the sutures.  This hematoma is anterior to the sagittal suture.  (The metopic suture, which fuses early in infancy, does not present a barrier to epidural hematomas.)

Another notable finding is the presence of an occipital infarct ipsilateral to the large hematoma.  The mass effect of the hematoma resulted in left-sided transtentorial herniation, causing both the pupillary abnormality evident to the clinicians and the occipital infarct evident to the radiologists.  Compression of the oculomotor nerve (CN III) against the tentorium results in dysfunction of the parasympathetic fibers innervating the pupil and pupillary dilation.  Compression of the posterior cerebral artery results in infarction in its distribution.
