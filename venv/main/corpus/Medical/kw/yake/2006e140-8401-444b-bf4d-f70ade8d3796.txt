Pt is asymptomatic
A nodular opacity is seen in the left mid lung field on PA chest radiograph. It is unchanged 3 weeks later, and is not seen on a lateral image. Review of prior CT (6 years ago) reveals previously unidentified calcified pleural plaques that correlate to chest x-ray findings.
Asbestos Pleural Plaques
Pt is a 76yo man, retired navy shipyard worker.  A pulmonary nodule was found incidentally on chest x-ray.
This man worked fro 20+ years in a naval shipyard and was likely exposed to asbestos. Asbestos exposure can cause benign pleural disease, asbestosis, carcinoma, and malignant pleural mesothelioma. Pleural calcifications usually indicate benign disease. Malignant findings include multiple pleural nodules, diffuse pleural thickening >1 cm (often circumferential), and mediastinal pleural involvement.
