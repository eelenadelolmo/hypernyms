Physical examination reveals bilateral hearing loss, balance problems, visual deficits as well as motor weakness and sensory changes.
The patient is being followed up with an MRI of the head and spine on annual basis. She under went a partial resection of large scwhannoma in the cervicomedullary which was causing severe mass effect on the spinal cord and medulla oblongata.
Multiplanar MR Imaging demonstrates the presence of multiple cranial nerve tumors located at the internal auditory canals and in the Meckel cave,   a small spinal intracanal intramedullary tumor at the cervicomedullary junction , numerous intraspinal Â­extramedullary tumors involving almost the entire spine and multiple masses of the brachial plexus nerves.
Neurofibromatosis type 2
Differential diagnosis includes epidermoid, arachnoid cyst, aneurysm and ependymoma for the CPA lesions. Scwhannomatosis , metastasis (from CNS or non-CNS primary) and granulomatous diseases are also considered in the differential diagnosis list.
A 15-year old girl is referred for routine serial MRI of the brain and spine (entire neuraxis) in the setting of a known disorder.
This is a classic case of Neurofibromatosis type 2. It should be kept in mind that whenever bilateral vestibular scwhannomas are detected in a patient suspected of NF2 ( Neurofibromatosis type 2) the entire neuraxis must be imaged.
