-MRI of the brain pre and post gadolinium demonstrates a T1 dark, T2 intermediate to hyperintense lesion emanating from the anterior cranial fossa into the left nasal region with moderate, homogeneous contrast enhancement.  There is also a T1 dark, T2 bright signal present in the left maxillary sinus, sphenoid sinus, and the left frontal ethmoid recess, which demonstrates a peripheral rim of enhancement.

CT and MRI are valuable tools in evaluating anterior skull base tumors.  While the appearances of these tumors tend to be nonspecific, there are certain characteristics that may help in narrowing the differential such as...
