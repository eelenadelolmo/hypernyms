c-99m HDP Delayed Image.
Heterogeneously increased activity in the right femur suggestive of Paget disease. Left calvarial uptake, suggestive of osteoporosis circumscripta. Multiple foci of probable degenerative change in the spine. Mildly increased uptake in the right maxillary antrum of uncertain etiology, as well as heterogeneously increased uptake in the maxilla and mandible suggestive of dental or periodontal disease. Increased uptake typical of degenerative changes noted in the right greater than left shoulder, L5-S1, bilateral knees, and right ankle and proximal right foot.
Paget Disease
The combination of the expansile lesion with intensely increased uptake in the right femur, with the skull lesion typical of osteoporosis circumscripta and the CT demonstrating coarse, thickened trabeculae in the absence of a bony tumor is radiographically pathognomonic.  The heterogeneous nature of the increased uptake, with areas of relatively significant photopenia raises the possibility of malignant degeneration, for which an assessment should be made.    

Metastatic disease, myeloma and other osseous dysplasias may have a similar, but not typically identical, bone scan appearance.
