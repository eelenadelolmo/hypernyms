Physical exam notable for a sacral dimple overlying the coccyx. Otherwise physical exam within normal limits.
The finding merits conservative management in asymptomatic individuals, with re-evaluation only warranted with the emergence of symptomatology.
On ultrasound the patient was found to have a smooth walled, cigar shaped cystic dilation of the caudal spinal cord overlaying the L2 vertebral body at the level of the conus medullaris. The dilatation ended approximately 1 segment beyond the spinal cord at L3. The dilated area appears to be contiguous with the central canal, with enhancement through transmission to the underlying vertebral body. There were no septations, intracystic masses, edema, or tethering.
