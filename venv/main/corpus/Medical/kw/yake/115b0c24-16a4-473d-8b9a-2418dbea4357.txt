37 y.o. female presents to the Breast Care Clinic with multiple right breast masses.
Well-circumcribed masses are almost always benign, however 5% of these masses can be carcinoma. Cysts are the most common well-circumscribed masses seen in women between the ages of 35 to 50. Fibroadenomas are the most-common solid masses seen on mammography. Multiple masses are also a sign of benignity. Aside from cysts and fibroadenomas, they may also be multiple papillomas. Less likely is metastatic disease. Multi-focal primary breast cancers are seen as ill-defined or stellate lesions that are suspicious in appearance.
