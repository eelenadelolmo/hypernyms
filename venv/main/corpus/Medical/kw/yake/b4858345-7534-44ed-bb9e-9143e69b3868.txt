Physical exam:  No neurological deficits.  Nonpitting lower extremity edema from the thighs to the ankles.  Pulses were normal bilaterally.

Labs:
Positive for one copy of R506Q (Factor V Leiden) mutation (heterozygous for Factor V Leiden).
Endovascular thrombolysis was performed.  Patient subsequently had rethrombosis within 6 hours of initial procedure and a stent was placed in the inferior vena cava at the level of the liver secondary to congenital narrowing.
CT:  The inferior vena cava demonstrated a filling defect  just caudal to the liver with narrowing.  Enlargement of the inferior vena cava extended through the iliac and femoral vessels.  Collateral vessels were demonstrated in the left paravertebral region;  associated vascular engorgement of the venous plexus with extrinsic effect upon the thecal sac in the central canal.

MR:  Decreased signal within the inferior vena cava extending into the common femoral veins.  Collateral vessels extending posteriorly towards the left paraspinal region also demonstrated thrombus.

US:  (not included) Noncompressibility in the left common femoral vein to the proximal femoral vein without respiratory variation or augmentation.
IVC thrombus with bilateral deep venous thrombosis
N/A
21-year-old man who presented after a 3- to 4-day period of gastroenteritis with subsequent vomiting, diarrhea, and presumed dehydration. He presented to the clinic with initial complaints of bilateral lower extremity aching and swelling. This subsequently worsened despite conservative measures, and he was subsequently transferred to a medical treatment facility for further evaluation.  At presentation, he has back pain and lower extremity swelling.
Given the patient's young age at presentation for significant venous thrombosis, the underlying risk factors for this patient included dehydration and heterozygosity for Factor V Leiden.
