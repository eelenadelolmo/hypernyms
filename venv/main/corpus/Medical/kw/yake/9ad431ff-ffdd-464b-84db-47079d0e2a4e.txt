T2 axial images demonstrate focal and linear white matter hyperintensities.  The posterior lesions are focal, while the right anterior lesion is linear with a cystic component.  Hypointense nodules are present jutting into the ventricles bilaterally.  A hyperintense focus is also present in the right frontal lobe gray matter, with associated cortical thickening.
