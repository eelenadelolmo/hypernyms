REMARKABLE FOR GRADE II/VI MURMUR AUSCULTATED, BEST HEARD @ UPPER L STERNAL BORDER, W/SPLIT S1.  

CBC ELEVATED @ 12.1, W/BAND CELL ELEVATION OF 83.
No treatement is needed for the quadricuspid pulmonary valve.
Chest radiolgraphs (not shown) demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and an enlarged main pulmonary artery.  After patient recovered from pneumonia, cardiac-gated Chest CT was performed

CT findings:  
Quadricuspid pulmonary valve with extra vestigial leaflet between the left and right posterior leaflet.
Quadricuspid pulmonary valve with likely associated prominance of the main pulmonary artery.  MPA prominence may be due to component of pulmonic stenosis and regurgitation.
Quadricuspid Pulmonary Valve
21Male c/o worsening productive cough x 2 weeks.
The patient is a 21year old male Marine recruit who presented to the clinic with four days of productive cough and fatitigue.  He was diagnosed with pneumonia.  He completed 10 day course of Avelox, and pulmonary symptoms substantially improved.  During the evaluation a Cardiac Gated CT was ordered to further evaluate pulmonary artery fullness detected on radiographs.

The gated CT study was notable for quadricuspid pulmonary valve abnormality. 

Cardiology reviewed the cardiac-gated CT scan and echocardiogram results that demonstrated mild valvular pulmonic stenosis and trace pulmonic valvular regurgitation.  Based on functional assesment of this patient (high exercise tolerance, no dyspnea on exertion) this vestigial cusp is functionally not signficant and thus is compatible with military service.
