enlarged right testicle, approximately 6 cm.

HCG elevated at 30
Intratesticular mass lesion, well demarcated from normal testicular parenchyma, normal testicular blood flow.

Histology shows a classic type seminoma with mainly heterogeneous cells with large nuclei and prominent nucleoli.  There are scattered multinucleated "giant cell" type syncitiotrophoblast cells, which are the HCG secreting cells.  The presence of these cells does not make this a mixed tumor, but does cause the somewhat unusual hormone pattern.

CT was negative for lymphadenopathy
Seminoma, classic type with scattered syncitiotrophoblast elements
