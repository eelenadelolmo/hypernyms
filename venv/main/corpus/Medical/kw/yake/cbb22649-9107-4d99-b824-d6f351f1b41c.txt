Images from 16 SEP 2003 demonstrate renal pelvis dilatation to approximately 7mm in AP dimension bilaterally.  Normal appearing renal parenchyma and bladder.  Normal amniotic fluid volume.  

Follow up sonogram on 17 OCT 2003 demonstrate interval decrease in the renal pelvis dimension to a less significant measurement of 4mm bilaterally.

Follow up exam on 23 DEC 2003 demonstrate marked worsening of renal pelvis size.  Current measurements up to 14mm bilaterally. Additionally there is calyceal dilatation bilaterally. The renal parenchyma remained normal however.  No cortical atrophy identified.
The bladder is also dilated and did not empty during the exam, which took over 1.5 hours to complete and fully evaluate with staff review.  The bladder wall was not particularly thickened on this exam.  The distal ureters are dilated bilaterally.

3. UVJ obstruction
4. Prune-belly syndrome
