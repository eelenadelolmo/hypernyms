49 year old woman, with Lupus, presents with a first time seizure.
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome has become a little bit of a misnomer, because the lesions are not limited to the posterior brain (occipital lobe) and the lesions are not always reversible. PMID: 17885064

More recent reports have also implicated underlying autoimmune dysfunction of endothelial cells, causing a breakdown in the blood-brain-barrier.  PMID: 20435835
