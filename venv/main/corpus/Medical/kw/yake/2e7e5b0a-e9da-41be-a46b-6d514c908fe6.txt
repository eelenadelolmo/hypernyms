Patient has leukocytosis, fever, and increased creatinine level from baseline.
Percutaneous Nephrostomy to relieve obstruction:
After access was gained in the right renal collecting system, frank pus was aspirated.  The nephrostomy tube was placed uneventfully after draining the pus. Three days later, the patient's WBC and serum creatinine levels had returned to baseline.
Noncontrast CT of the abdomen demonstrates a dilated right collecting system with perinephric stranding and a large calculus in the dilated ureter at the anastamosis with the ileal diversion.  Fluoroscopic spot image demonstrates an opacified right renal collecting system and proximal ureter with a right percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed the evening of presentation.

57 year old man has fevers, chills, right sided flank, and abdominal pain.  Previous history of Transitional Cell Carcinoma treated with cystectomy, left nephrectomy, and right urinary diversion to ileostomy.
As this was the patient's only kidney, it was imperative to relieve the obstruction promptly to retain renal function.
