Physical Exam:
Musculoskeletal: Back ROM limited by pain, full LE ROM with only minimal discomfort, mild swelling left of L4/L5 with point tenderness over those vertebrae.   More pain with palpation of soft tissue on right with increased paraspinal muscle tone there.  

Neuro: CN 2-12 grossly intact, normal tone in extremities, normal sensation, 5/5 strength except with hip flexion due to pain, normal UE reflexes, diminished patellar reflex but normal Achilles reflex bilaterally.

The patient received empiric antibiotic treatment for suspected Staphylococcus Aureus osteomyelitis with a 3 week course of IV vancomycin followed by PO clindamycin.  She continued to follow with infectious disease and orthopedics during that time.  Repeat lumbosacral MRI was performed that showed resolution of inflammatory changes.  At that time, antibiotics were discontinued per ID.  

The diagnosis was confirmed clinically by the patient’s improvement in symptoms following empiric antibiotic treatment.  Additionally, the patient was noted to have declining ESR and repeat lumbosacral MRI confirmed resolution of inflammatory changes noted on the initial MRI.  

A CT-guided aspiration of the paraspinous soft tissue had been attempted for definitive diagnosis to guide treatment, but no PMN’s or bacteria were visualized on the gram stain and cultures remained negative.
AP and lateral views of lumbar spine: Spondylolysis without spondylolistesis noted at L4. Disc space narrowing is present at L4-L5 and L5-S1.  A mild scoliosis is present (convex left) with patient in the supine position.

MRI of lumbosacral spine with and without contrast: There is an abnormal STIR signal in the vertebral bodies at L4 and L5. Abnormal signal extends into the pedicle on the patient"s left
side at L5. Loss of disc space is most prominent at L4-L5. On the pre-contrast images, there is a 3.1 x 1.3 x 2.5 cm mass of soft tissue density anterior and left lateral to the disc space at L4-L5. On the post-contrast images there is marked enhancement in the vertebral bodies which corresponds with the abnormality noted on the STIR images. The abnormally enhancing, ill-defined tissue completely surrounds the inferior margin and disc space at L4-L5.

A 16 year-old girl, with a 2 year history of recurrent low back pain secondary to sports-related injuries, presents following her most recent injury, in which she was struck in the back while playing basketball.  She saw a chiropractor for acute exacerbation of that pain following this injury and was given a prescription for Flexeril and told to take NSAIDs.  Several weeks later while getting ready for school she collapsed due to pain and was taken to the ED.   
     

The patient endorsed some mild fatigue and a 5 lb weight loss, but denied any history of fevers, chills, night sweats or any recent illnesses or ill contacts.
