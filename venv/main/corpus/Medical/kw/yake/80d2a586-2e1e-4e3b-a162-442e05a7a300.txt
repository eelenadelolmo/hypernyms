Musculoskeletal:
Strength - He had weakness in the left deltoid graded 2/5.  He had weakness in the left biceps,  left finger extensors and left wrist extensors all graded 4/5.  Left hand grip strength = 20 lbs. Right hand grip strength = 40lbs. Right upper extremity strength 5/5. Lower extremity strength 5/5 bilaterally, except for left dorsiflexors which were 4/5.  The left arm could be minimally abducted from the body during assessment of range of motion. 

Cervical ROM – Flexion = 13?/50?, left rotation = 12?/80?, right rotation = 18?/80?, left lateral bending = 9?/45?, right lateral bending = 10?/45?, extension = 3?/60?. He reported neck pain with all ranges of motion.

Thoracolumbar ROM – Flexion = 12?/90? with report of low back pain, left lateral bending = 6?/25?, right lateral bending = 7?/25?. Extension = 3?/25?.

Neuro: Biceps reflex 0/4 on left and 2/4 on right. Triceps reflex 2/4 bilaterally. Subpatellar reflex 0/4 on left and 2/4 on right. Achilles reflex 2/4 bilaterally. Sensation to light touch intact in both upper and lower extremities, bilaterally. Negative Hoffman sign.

EMG evaluation performed of the cervical and upper extremities demonstrated a C5 radiculopathy on the left side.
He is currently being treated with NSAIDs and chiropractic treatment. 

Relative to chiropractic care a specific manipulative approach has been utilized.  The patient is seated in a chair with approximately 30 degrees of right head rotation.  His head is cradled against the treating doctors chest/abdomen.  A contact is taken at C4 articular processes on the left side with the doctors right hand reinforced by the left hand.  A caudal to cranial thrust is applied with the back and arms of the treating doctor.  An audible sound and gross movement are appreciated.  Such serves to open the intervertebral foraminal regions on the left side of the neck at C4 and below.  He also receives cervical traction decompressive cycle for 15 minutes at approximately 22 lbs with mastoid contact and without jaw pressure.  He also uses a pneumatic cervical traction device at home for 30 minutes per day.   The patient has noted vast improvement in his level of pain and also notes increased strength and mobility of his left arm.  He reports that previous to care he was only able to raise his left arm minimally from his body and now can raise it above his head.  Such is related to the deltoid muscle in particular that has innervation from the axillary nerve and spinal centers of C5 and C6.  He also demonstrates remarkable increased motion in right and left rotation of the cervical spine without increased pain.
Cervical MRI: Mild-moderate posterior disc bulge in C2-C3 & C3-C4, central disc herniation in C4-C5 & C5-C6, broad-based central disc osteophyte complex at C6-C7 with effacement of subarachnoid space, diffuse facet joint arthropathy and uncovertebral joint hypertrophy resulting in  neural foraminal stenosis from C2-C7.

Thoracic MRI: Large hemangioma of T11 vertebral body without associated compression fracture or bony abnormalities, right posterior bulge with minimal subarachnoid effacement at T3-T4, central posterior herniation at T4-T5 with mild indentation of spinal cord, paracentral herniations partially effacing subarachnoid space at T5-T6 and T6-T7.

Though not from this patient, we are including a DMX to demonstrate spinal canal narrowing caused by flexion and extension of the spine with retrolisthesis: <a title="External Website", target="somelink" href="http://youtu.be/nLtiX1wj2Nw"> click here for video </a>. Note the retrolisthesis at the C3 level on extension.

CC: Neck and back pain after work accident

Patient is a 62 y.o. man with a past medical history significant for smoking. He complains of neck, midback, and lower back pain since a work related accident a little over a year ago. He states he was “peeling” Cu and went to pick up a large piece of metal weighing 40 lbs. He denies any previous injury to the spine, vehicular accidents, falls, athletic injuries, or other work related injuries. Since the accident, he states the neck pain is intermittent and is a 4/10 on average, 9/10 at worst. The pain is located in the posterior neck and radiates to bilateral upper extremities, left greater than right. He also reports numbness and paresthesia to both hands, left greater than right. He has also experienced moderate clumsiness in his hands and fingers, worsening handwriting, and left hand weakness (he is right hand dominant). In his back, the patient states his mid-to-low back pain is intermittent and rates it 0-4/10 on average, 9/10 at its worst. He reports numbness and paresthesia radiating to his left calf. He denies any loss of balance or coordination while walking, perineal or saddle distribution numbness/tingling, or bowel/bladder dysfunction or incontinence.

Since the accident, he has not been working and had participated in physical therapy with slow and steady improvement. However, once the program was discontinued, his symptoms returned.  The patient is a direct referral for chiropractic care of his condition.

Patient is a 62 year old man with a past medical history significant for smoking who presented with neck and back pain following a work accident lifting 40 lbs. He has symptoms of neck pain radiating to both arms, LUE weakness and muscle atrophy, LLE dorsiflexor weakness, absent left bicep reflex and absent left patellar reflex.

His symptoms are interesting in the context of having both severe central spinal stenosis concurrent with neural foramina narrowing seen on MRI. Electromyography was done on the patient and ruled out peripheral neuropathies.  

The neck & upper extremity pain, left arm weakness, atrophy, and absent biceps reflex point to a lower motor neuron lesion - which can be caused by both spinal stenosis and radiculopathy. However, he has weakness in the left lower extremity which can be explained as a result of myelopathy from cervical stenosis. Alternatively, he may have simultaneous lumbar pathology causing nerve root damage.

Likely, his symptoms are secondary to the  combination of spinal stenosis and radiculopathy secondary to disc herniation and neural foraminal narrowing. An MRI of his lumbar spine would be useful in elucidating all contributing factors of his symptoms.
