Choanal Atresia and Congenital Nasal Airway Obstruction
Unilateral chaonal atresia
priform sinus aperture narrowing
midnose stenosis
Three year old female with chronic nasal congestion and difficulty breathing.  The child was diagnosed with suspected unilateral choanal atresia by prior ENT evaluation.
Unilateral choanal atresia can often go undiagnosed due to the patient's ability to breath from the one side as an infant.  As was the case in this child the condition was not suspected until much later after chonic complaints of congestion and inability to breathe well.
