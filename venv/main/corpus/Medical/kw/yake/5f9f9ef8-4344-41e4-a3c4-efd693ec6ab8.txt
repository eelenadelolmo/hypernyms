On examination the patient’s lungs were clear to auscultation.  Her heart rate was regular without murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Neurologic examination was normal.  Her room air resting SaO2 was 99% which quickly fell to 93% with ambulation.  Following imaging, bronchioaveolar lavage was conducted revealing Cryptococcus neoformans on fluid culture.  Cell count 1 revealed RBC 386, WBC 133, Neutrophils 9, Lymphocytes 24, and Macrophages 67.  Cell count 2 revealed RBC 363, WBC 199, Neutrophils 41, Lymphocytes 24, Macrophages 33, and Eosinophils 2. Culture was negative to all else including aerobic cultures, acid fast bacilli, and fungal smears.  Subsequent serum labs revealed a negative ANCA, IgE 64, LDH 586, Eosinophils 0, and negative HIV.  Serum Cryptococcal antigen testing was also negative.
Due to the symptomatic nature of her disease, treatment was begun with Fluconazol 300 mg by mouth daily for 6 months.  Her check-up 1 month later revealed markedly decreased nodular infiltrates on both chest x-ray and CT.  The patient also reported resolution of her cough and overall malaise.
Chest x-ray demonstrated rounded lobular nodules in the left lower lobe.  CT pulmonary angiogram revealed multiple enhancing left lower lobe masses, some with cavitation.

A 53-year-old woman presents to the ED with a three month history of a chronic dry cough, malaise, and increasing dyspnea on exertion.  Significant medical history included a positive PPD in 1985 which was treated with 1 year of Isoniazid.  Other medical history included hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus.  She had immigrated to the United States from the Phillipines two decades ago. She denied any history of smoking or alcohol use.  She had also visited the Philippines several months ago.
The presentation of this patient along with her positive cultures solidifies the diagnosis of Cryptococcal pneumonia, a rare condition in an otherwise healthy female. Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus usually acquired via inhalation of dehydrated yeast cells or basidiospores that has been shown in analysis of soils to be found with pigeon excreta. Inhalation of the spores is believed to be the primary means of acquisition.  When considering the prevalence of the disease, serologic studies have demonstrated evidence of widespread subclinical infection in individuals without a history of symptomatic infection with most adults having a positive serum antibody to Cryptococcus neoformans. Thus, it appears that the subclinical primary infection is common and the vast majority of patients are asymptomatic.  Despite strong serologic evidence, symptomatic Cryptococcus remains a very rare disease in individuals without impaired immunity.  An active surveillance conducted in the early 90’s in Alabama estimated the incidence of active Cryptococcus infections at 0.84 cases per 100,000 in non-HIV individuals.  However, in patients with advanced HIV infections living in San Francisco and Atlanta in the early 90’s, the incidence was higher and was estimated to be anywhere from 17 to 66 cases per 1000 individuals.  Other patients who appear to be at increased risk include cancer patients and those individuals receiving organ transplants.  Thus, the subsequent course of the infection (resolution vs. latent infection vs. acute infection with or without dissemination) appears to be primarily determined by the host’s immune status.
