Choroid plexus cysts may be associated with chromosomal abnormalities.  When present, these represent one soft marker.  A search should be made for additional findings.  As isolated findings, they are seen in 1-2% of normal fetuses.  In a larger study that was published in the Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine in 2004, low risk mothers with this finding as an isolated abnormality should have the addition of open-hand images of the fetus attempted.  In a large series, only few fetuses were identified with trisomy demonstrating only choroid plexus cysts prenatally.  The addition of open-hand images to exclude persistent clinched fist which may rarely be the only additional finding seen in trisomy 18, eliminated the failure to diagnose trisomy.  While it is still a topic for debate, choroid plexus cysts (solitary or multiple) as the sole finding on prenatal ultrasound in low risk mothers does not require any additional workup.  These at our institution are treated as a normal variant.
