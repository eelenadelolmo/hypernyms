Conservative treatments failed and a followup MRI showed increased osteonecrosis.  The patient subsequently underwent knee arthroplasty and did well, returning to work with no limitations.
MR images demonstrate a T1-dark, PD-bright lesion in the weightbearing articular portion of the medial femoral condyle, with mild thinning of the adjacent articular cartilage and a small focal depression in the adjacent cortical bone consistent with mild collapse. A small amount of PD-bright signal consistent with edema is present in the adjacent medial tibial plateau.
