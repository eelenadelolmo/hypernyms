Giant Cell Tumor
• Giant cell tumor
• Aneurysmal bone cyst - usually skeletally immature patient, should have no solid components on MRI 
• Intraosseus ganglion - usually older patient and has sclerotic margin, no solid components on MRI
• Chondroblastoma - usually skeletally immature patient, smaller and centered on epiphysis, usually has a sclerotic margin and often contains calcifications
• Chondromyxoid fibroma - more rare, typically metaphyseal location but without subarticular extension, usually sclerotic margin
