Axial CT images of the subdiaphragmatic inferior vena cava show a well-defined, round focus of fat attenuation (-80 HU) initially presumed to be contained within the lumen of the IVC.

62 year-old female with a prior ultrasound showing a “mass” at the right hepatic lobe.  Three phase liver CT was recommended for further evaluation.
