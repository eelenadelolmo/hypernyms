The large pulmonary arteries and cardiomegaly are not typically seen with is syndrome and raised the question of a cardiac defect, as the chest film demonstrated shunt vascularity.  At pulmonary angiography, it was demonstrated the entire right lung drained in to the scimitar vein and emptied at the junction of the IVC and right atrium.  In addition, an ASD was present.  So, for all practical purposes, our patient had two left-to-right shunts.
