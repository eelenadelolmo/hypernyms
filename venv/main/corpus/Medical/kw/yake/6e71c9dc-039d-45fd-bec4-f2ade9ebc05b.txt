Normal neurovascular exam.  
No palpable deformities.  
Serum calcium normal.
Vitamin D level normal.
Bilateral medial distal femoral physeal stapling to allow lateral growth and decreased medial angulation of the knee joint.  The orthopedic surgeons did not feel that the child had slipped capital femoral epiphyses and did not obtain a frog-leg lateral view, which would have further defined the femoral head placement.
Bilateral femoral physeal widening with dense metaphyseal bands.  Bilateral slipped capital femoral epiphysis noted.  Additionally, the sacroiliac joints appear widened adn there are bilateral coxa vara deformities. 
The constellation of findings suggests a systemic process due to abnormal Vitamin D metabolism.
