AVN
Active duty man with hip pain.
Evaluation in total joint clinic
report of AVN in both hips
AVN in  a young, active duty male is often associated with steroid use.  Other potential causes in this patient include trauma, infection and caisson dz.  Chronic/inflamatory causes such as sickle cell disease, lupus, Gaucher's dz or radiation therapy are much less likely in a service member on active duty. 

Although cases as advanced as this are clearly visible on plain film, AVN is best evaluated on MR imaging.
