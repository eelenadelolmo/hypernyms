VSS: Normal. ABD: Palpable mass LUQ, tender on exam. Otherwise unremarkable.
1/14/04 Ultrasound Images:
- Round, well-circumscribed, solid suprarenal mass of heterogeneous echotexture with shadowing calcification. Mass abuts but does not involve left kidney, abuts but does not involve spleen, abuts but does not involve bowel. It encroaches on and compresses the left renal vein and the aorta. 

2) 1/14/04 CT A/P Images:
Origin likely adrenal by CT. Ultrasound observations confirmed (non-renal, non-splenic, non-GI origin). Also, importantly, tumor's venous drainage - adrenal vein into the left renal vein - helps to localize it to the adrenal. Given imaging characteristics and adrenal origin, most likely diagnosis is neuroblastoma.
