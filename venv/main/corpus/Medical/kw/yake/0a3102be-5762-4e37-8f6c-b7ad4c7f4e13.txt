None if no bleeding symptoms develop.  At delivery, careful inspection of the placenta should be performed.
Sagittal views.  Greyscale image of the fundus shows clearly demarcated placental lobes.  Doppler image demonstrate the sulcus separating the two lobes is at the cord insertion.
Succenturiate lobe of the Placenta
Amniotic band
Normal, lobulated placenta.
25 y/o woman at 28 WEGA with uncomplicated pregnancy thus far.
The succenturiate placenta is a morphological abnormality, the antenatal recognition of which is important as vessels connecting the main placenta with the succenturiate placenta may rupture during labor and fetal death may ensue.  It is a separate mass of chorionic villi connected to the main placenta by vessels within a membrane.    The lobe forms after local failure of normal villous atrophy.  This anomaly occurs in 0.14-8% of pregnancies Multiple lobes have been described.  
A succenturiate lobe may  be mistaken for an amniotic band.   Careful doppler analysis is needed to distinguish between the two.  The radiologist should make certain that the patient's obstetrician is aware of this finding.   Retention of the placental material may lead to postpartum hemorrhage.    More catastrophic is rupture of the fetal vessels connecting the lobe to the placenta.  Succenturiate vessels traversing the internal os may rupture and result in fetal blood loss and   when no cause of uterine bleeding is detected, previa of a posterior succenturiate lobe should be considered.
