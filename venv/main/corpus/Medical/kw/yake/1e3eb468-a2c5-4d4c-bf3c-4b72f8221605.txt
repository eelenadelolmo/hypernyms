Axial CT images demonstrate a mass in the left lower quadrant within the descending colon. This mass had a targetoid appearance and did not allow enteric ontrast to freely pass: consistent with the "Target Sign" of intussuscepting bowel. In this case a proximal portion of colon (the intussusceptum) had herniated into a distal portion of colon (the intussuscipiens). There was also a soft tissue mass surrounded by a crescent of gas in the left lower quadrant.
