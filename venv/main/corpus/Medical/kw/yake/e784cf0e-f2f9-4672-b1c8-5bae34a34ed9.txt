Mesenteric adenitis is a self-limited disease and treatment is supportive.
Multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes ranging from 6 mm to 1.1 cm in size.  These were present at both mesenteric and right lower quadrant locations.  Top normal appendix size (5.5 to 6 mm) with free fluid in right lower quadrant surrounding appendix.
Mesenteric adenitis
1)  Appendicitis
2)  Mesenteric adenitis
5 y/o male with 1-2 days of nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain and fever.
This patient has a paucity of intra-abdominal fat which limits the visibility of the appendix.  Even if a portion of the appendix is visible and apparently normal, a tip or proximal appendicitis may be present.  A rupture appendix can return to a normal diameter.  Completely delineating the normal appendix in a child, even in this era of isometric coronal and sagital reformatting, remains challenging

Focal adenopathy in the distribution of the lymphatic drainage of the ileocolic vessels which subserve the appendix can be an indirect sign of appendicitis.  In this case however, the adenopathy is diffuse.  This suggests the diagnosis of mesenteric adenititis but does not exclude the diagnosis of appendicitis from the differential.  

Unless the entire appendix can be completely identified, the ER physician and surgeon need to be reminded that CT is a specific test for appendicitis, not a particularly sensitive one.  Surgical decisions still need to be based on clinical criteria.
