Right-sided facial weakness.
No treatment is required for a benign pineal cyst, unless it grows in size causing mass effect.
Axial T1 and T2 images demonstrate a 5 x 6 x 4 mm cystic structure at the normal location of the pineal gland which is hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2. Axial and Coronal T1W images after the addition of gadolinium shows that the lesion does not significantly enhance.
