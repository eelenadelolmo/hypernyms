• Bacterial Pneumonia (S. pneumoniae, Klebsiella,    Legionella, H.influenzae, S. aureus, Mycoplasma)
• Viral pneumonia – less likely with a complete lobe consolidation
• Lobar collapse – you would expect to see volume loss and fissure displacement
• Neoplastic Lung mass (should not be so "anatomic")
