A good clinical history should be obtained with further lab studies as clinically indicated to rule out sarcoidosis and the collagen vascular disorders.  In the majority of patients, acral sclerosis is idiopathic and no treatment is required.
AP and Oblique views of the hands show small osteophytes at the distal interphalangeal, proximal interphalangeal joints of the digits bilaterally, and the interphalangeal joints and metacarpophalangeal joints of the thumbs bilaterally.  Subchondral cysts are also present at the metacarpophalangeal joints of the thumbs bilaterally associated with bilateral first carpometacarpal joint sclerosis. Acral sclerosis bilaterally.  The soft tissues are remarkable.

Osteoarthritis
Presented complaining of numbness and joint pain over the right index finger.
This patient has no erosions, periarticular osteopenia, finger subluxations, or soft tissue swelling to suggest rheumatoid arthritis. He also did not have any symptoms associated with Raynaudâ€™s phenomenon or stiffness of the skin at the distal phalanges.  His radiographs showed no soft tissue atrophy or acro-osteolysis along the distal phalanges, findings which would be consistent with scleroderma.  The patient did not have a history of systemic lupus erythematosus or sarcoidosis.  Further lab studies could be performed to rule out these diseases.  The acral sclerosis in this patient is most likely idiopathic in nature.  Although this case was in a male, idiopathic acral sclerosis is more common in women.
