ERYTHROPOIETIC PROTOPORPHYRIA (1997 Uniformed Services Dermatology Seminar, Case #29) Mary K. Mather, MAJ, MC, USA
6 year old male whose mother states that at approximately 12 months of age, the patient would "scream" whenever taken into the sun. She also commented that she noticed that his dorsal hands looked "leathery" and the bridge of his	nose and cheeks were red and irritated in appearance. Upon
moving to Georgia from Ohio at age 18 months, patient
developed a marked sunburn with short exposures to the sun. Patient was evaluated by Dermatology and Pediatrics, and	found to have markedly elevated erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels of 224 mcg/dl (normal <35 mcg/dl). There is 4+ red blood cell florescence. No known history of photosensitivity
in parents or younger sister.
