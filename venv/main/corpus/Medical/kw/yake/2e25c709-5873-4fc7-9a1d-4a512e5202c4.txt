Unknown at time of submission.  In the case of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome treatment is often supportive with close monitoring of blood volume.  Pleural effusions can be drained if they are symptomatic.
Bilateral lung opacities with blunting of costophrenic angles and menisci consistent with moderate sized pleural effusions and bilateral focal areas of atelectasis or airspace disease.  
Heart size difficult to assess due to overlapping pleural opacities.  
Mild thoracolumbar dextroscoliosis
Patient has pelvic shielding consistent with pregnancy
Trachea mid-line, no pneumothorax, vasculature not enlarged
Findings are new when compared with normal CXR in 2006.
Pleural effusion most likely caused by Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome; however, final diagnosis was not known prior to submission
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome
Meigs Syndrome
Cardiac, liver, or renal failure
Infection
Pulmonary embolism
Malignant effusion
31 year old female G3P0020 who is day 2 status post IVF cycle and now complains of difficulty breathing.
Work-up for Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome:
Labs-HCG, CBC, Chemistry, LFTs, estradiol, monitor I/Os
Imaging:  CXR, ultrasound of ovaries
Procedures:  Thoracentesis, drain pleural fluid

Discussion:
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome occurs when there is ovarian enlargement due to multiple cysts with a fluid shift out of the intravascular space.  It often occurs after ovarian stimulation via HCG/HMG in women trying to conceive.  Other risk factors are PCOS, thyroid disease, age <35, pregnancy or previous history of OHSS.  The fluid shift is thought to be due to the cysts secreting vasoactive substances which leads to ascites and pleural effusion.  When severe this syndrome can cause renal failure, thrombosis, hypovolemic shock, ARDS, or death.  Symptoms usually appear 5-10 days following induction of ovulation and can include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, SOB, ascites.  Treatment is often supportive by maintaining intravascular volume, monitoring I/Os and providing DVT prophylaxis.  Pleural effusions can be drained for symptom relief.
