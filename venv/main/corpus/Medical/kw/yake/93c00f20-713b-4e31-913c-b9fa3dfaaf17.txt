No concerning mass or enhancement was demonstrated.  A previously performed ultrasound of the breast demonstrated no underlying mass in the periareolar region of patient's pain.  Given these findings the MR fits a BIRADS category 2 for benign findings.
Multiple well circumscribed foci of nonenhancing, increased T2 signal on STIR and decreased signal on T2 fat suppressed sequences in the breasts without skin thickening.

No concerning areas of enhancement on post gadolinium sequences.
