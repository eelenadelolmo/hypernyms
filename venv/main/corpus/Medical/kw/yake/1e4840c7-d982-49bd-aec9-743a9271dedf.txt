Right sided scrotal fullness with palpable dilation of the veins. No labs at this time.
As this study was done to rule out mass/compression effect on the right gonadal vein, and no evidence of such was found, follow up was not reccomended at this time.
An abdominal/pelvic CT was performed which showed an aborrant right gonadal vein, which ended in the right renal vein, rather than connecting directly to the IVC as is typical.  No evidence of any compressive mass was seen.  An incidental finding of a simple cortical renal cyst was observed.
Varicocele secondary to aborrant drainage of right gonadal vein into the right renal vein
-Obstruction of gonadal vein from IVC thrombus due to a right renal tumor
-compression from a retroparitoneal mass
-vascular anomaly
Pt presented to his PCM complaining of right scrotal discomfort. He described it as an intermittant, achy pain that seemed to worsen after prolonged periods of standing, and be relieved with lying down. He stated that it seemed to occur more frequently over time.  He was diagnosed with a varicocele and advised to undergo an abdominal CT for further work up due to the unusual presentation of this being a unilateral right sided varicocele.
