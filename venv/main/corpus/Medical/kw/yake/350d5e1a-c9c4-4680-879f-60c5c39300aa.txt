Transient lateral pharyngeal outpouchings without mass or filling defects.
Lateral pharyngeal pouches
Lateral pharyngeal diverticula.
Pharyngeal diverticula (Killian-Jamieson type).
Parapharyngeal hernia.
60 year old male with history of dysphagia to solids and reflux.
Because the outpouchings were transient they are consistent with normal variant.  The patient's symptoms of dysphagia were not definitively related.  Some patients may complain of dysphagia, which is caused by the late spilling of pouch contents into the pharynx.  This condition may be associated with chronic pharyngitis, though this patient did not have symptomatology suggestive of this.
