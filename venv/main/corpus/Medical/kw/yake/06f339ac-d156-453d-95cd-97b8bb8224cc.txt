The first bilateral mammogram shows heterogeneous distribution of fibroglandular densities. There is a subtle focal asymmetric density in the right upper out quadrant.  On the following mammogram, approximately a year later, the density in the right upper outer quadrant has increased in size and shows mild architectural distortion.  Targeted ultrasound of the right breast at the 10-11 o&#8217;clock position shows an ill-defined hypoechoic mass with posterior acoustic shadowing.
