ANA and anti-dsDNA positive
All other causes of myelitis were ruled out by clinical, laboratory (CSF analysis, blood tests), imaging data and the evolution of the process. The patients fulfilled the criteria for lupus and neuropsychiatric lupus.

Complete neurological recovery and normal follow-up MRI 5 months later.
Pattern of transverse myelitis: extensive longitudinal and axial involvement of cervical, thoracic and bulbar level.

No supratentorial lesions were present.
Lupus myelitis.
Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis
Neuromyelitis optica
Infections
Transverse myelitis (due to other connective tissue disorders, paraneoplastic syndromes, or vasculitis)
Idiopathic transverse myelitis
Spinal cord neoplasm
27 y.o. woman with sensory and motor complaints in upper and lower extremities.  She has a two year. history of lupus erythematosus
Myelopathy is one of the most debilitating complications of NPSLE. It has a prevalence of 1-5% of the SLE patients. It usually develops early in the evolution of the disease leading to an unfavorable prognosis. In 39% of the patients with lupus related myelopathy it constitutes the presenting symptom of SLE, and in another 42% occurs during the first 5 years after the diagnostic. The most described MRI pattern in SLE myelitis is consistent with transverse myelitis: commonly long affected segment (longitudinal myelitis) and with injury of both halves of the cord on axial plane (typically almost the entire transverse area). Transverse myelitis associates a variable swelling and focal enlargement. Enhancement is usually absent or poor, patchy. The pattern of transverse myelitis represents an abnormal and nonspecific reaction of the immune system against the spinal cord. It is the result of different inflammatory disorders of the spinal cord, it could be apparently idiopathic or associated with infections, vaccination (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis), neuromyelitis optica, connective tissue disorders, paraneoplastic syndrome or vasculitis. Even spinal cord tumours might be sometimes difficult to distinguish from a transverse myelitis. Therefore all these aetiologies have to be ruled out first in order to consider SLE myelitis. Clinical manifestations of myelitis are acute or subacute onset of motor, sensory and autonomic dysfunction, nonspecific, which obviously has an important overlap with other inflammatory entities. The outcome of SLE myelitis is variable, ranging from complete recovery to severe disability, but the injury is typically much less extensive or absent on follow up MRI.
