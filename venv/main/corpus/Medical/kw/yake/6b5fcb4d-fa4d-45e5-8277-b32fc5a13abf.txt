42 YO female presents with abdominal wall mass.  Over the past few years she relates that it may have grown slightly and says it becomes painful and enlarged during menses.  Her last pregancy required a C-section.
0.8% of C-section patients have abdominal wall endometrial implants associated with or close to incision site.  There have a few case reports of parasitic fibroid implants after laparoscopic myomectomies for fibroids as well.
