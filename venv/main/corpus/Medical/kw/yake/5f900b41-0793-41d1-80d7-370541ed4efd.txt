On exam, the child presented with no dysmorphic features.  His head circumference, height and weight were within expected normal limits.  Pupils were reactive bilaterally.  His speech was well articulated and fluent.  He exhibited a normal fundoscopic exam as well as full visual fields.  A right lateral rectus palsy was evident.  The remainder of his cranial nerve and physical exam showed no evidence of further abnormalities.
Upon being informed of the MRI results, the family requested a second opinion to consider surgical resection.  They brought the child to an outlying tertiary care center.  There they were set up with radiation therapy and further options such as trials involving combination radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy were presented to the family.  No further information regarding this child's treatment plan or outcome is known at the time of this publication.
Image #1  Sagittal T1 weighted image without contrast shows evidence of poorly defined diffuse low signal intesity within the pons without evidence of hydrocephalus.

Image #2  Axial T2 weighted image shows evidence of diffuse increased signal within the pons with mild mass effect and effacement of the fourth ventricle. 

Image #3  Sagittal T1 weighted image with gadolinum shows evidence of poorly defined diffuse low signal intensity within the pons with a small area of focal enhancement in the posteroinferior region of the pons.  Again no evidence of hydrocephalus is seen.

Previously healthy 8 year old child with headaches for one year now presents for evaluation of new-onset of difficulty moving his right eye laterally accompanied by double vision which has worsened over the last few days.  The mother states the double vision had been intermittent at first but then had become more prominent and persistent.
This family was very interested in a surgical option, but several opinions suggested medical therapy would be more important due to the location and size of the tumor.
