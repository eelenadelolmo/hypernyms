Physical exam and laboratory work up were normal.  Original ultrasound was performed for painless mass at superior pole of right testis which was found to be an epidydimal cyst.
Follow up and treatment of testicular microlithiaisis is somewhat controversial.  At this institution, patients are followed up with yearly screening ultrasounds, and advised to perform self-exams.
Testicular ultrasound demonstrates multiple, punctate, hyperechoic foci scattered diffusely throughout the testicular parenchyma.  These findngs are bilateral.  No other intratesticular abnormalities are noted.  Importantaly no solid masses were seen.
Testicular microlithiasis
Microlithiasis
23-year-old midshipman presents for one-year follow up for bilateral testicular microlithiasis.
Microlithiasis is not an uncommon incidental finding on testicular ultrasounds performed for other reasons, as in this case.  It is classified as classic if five or more microliths are seen on at least one view of the testis.  It is considered limited if there are fewer than this.  Microlithiasis has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of testicular malingnancy.  It is for this reason that in many institutions yearly screening ultrasounds are recommended.

Dilated and non-reactive left pupil
The patient underwent craniotomy and evacuation of the left-sided hematoma.  After recovery there was a persistent right-sided epidural hematoma.  Because of the left occipital infarction (secondary to compression of the PCA by uncal herniation) she has a persistent visual field defect.
• Large left frontal epidural hematoma
• Rightward subfalcine herniation with left uncal herniation.
• Small right parietal epidural hematoma.
• Large left subgaleal hematoma (scalp hematoma).
• Small medial left occipital lobe bland infarct.
• No calvarial fracture (by report)
Bilateral Epidural Hematoma, Herniation, PCA infarct
• Spontaneous parenchymal bleed
• Traumatic Epidural hematoma
• Traumatic Subdural hematoma
An 11 y.o. girl with sickle cell anemia was admitted with abdominal pain and joint pain.  She was treated for a painful SCA crisis.  Subsequently, she was "found down" and unresponsive.  There was no known head trauma.
Thi case is unusual for several reasons.  She had a left frontal epidural hematoma and smaller right-sided hematoma - resulting in subfalcine and downward trans-tentorial herniation with secondary left occipital infarct.

This is an unusual case of epidural hematoma in that there was no reported history of trauma.  An epidural hematoma associated with an ipsilateral subgaleal hematoma implies a common mechanism, that is, blunt trauma.  It is possible un-witnessed or unreported trauma occurred.  

The usual etiology for an epidural hematoma, laceration of a meningeal artery, is unlikely in the absence of a skull fracture, however, raising suspicion for an unusual etiology.

A second unusual feature is the presence of a second, contralateral hematoma.  Additionally, when the hematoma was evacuated, the surgeons encountered an unusual amount of bleeding and were forced to transfuse blood products to achieve hemostasis.  

One interesting imaging feature of this case is that the larger hematoma crosses the midline anteriorly.  This feature can be helpful in more subtle cases to distinguish epidural from subdural hematomas.  Supratentorial subdural hematomas do not cross the midline because they are blocked by the falx.  Note, however, that epidural hematomas rarely cross the midline where it coincides with the sagittal suture.  This is because epidural hematomas are subperiosteal; the outermost layer of the dura mater is the periosteum, which is adherent to the calvarium at the sutures.  This hematoma is anterior to the sagittal suture.  (The metopic suture, which fuses early in infancy, does not present a barrier to epidural hematomas.)

Another notable finding is the presence of an occipital infarct ipsilateral to the large hematoma.  The mass effect of the hematoma resulted in left-sided transtentorial herniation, causing both the pupillary abnormality evident to the clinicians and the occipital infarct evident to the radiologists.  Compression of the oculomotor nerve (CN III) against the tentorium results in dysfunction of the parasympathetic fibers innervating the pupil and pupillary dilation.  Compression of the posterior cerebral artery results in infarction in its distribution.

41 yo female with right upper quadrant pain and nausea.
This is a classic ultrasound appearance for the Wall Echo Shadow sign which is indicative of a gallstone filled gallbladder. You can visualize the gallbladder wall as an echogenic line with a posterior linear echogenic line that is gallstones against the wall and then a posterior clean shadow. You must differentiate gallstones from air or calcification in the wall. However, with air or calcification, you will only see echo and shadow. The gallbladder wall will not be visualized.




No palpable masses on breast exam.
Uneventful status post needle localization and open surgical excision.
Bilateral mammography was performed.  Mediolateral (MLO) and craniocaudal (CC) views as well as bilateral spot magnification CC views of the breasts show dilated subareolar ducts as well as bilateral, well-circumscribed 5-6mm nodular masses.  The masses are located at the 0400 position at the left breast and at the 0900 position of the right breast.  Patient subsequently underwent breast sonography at these locations.

Sonography of the left breast at the 0400 position, Zone 2A and of the right breast at the 0900 position, Zone 2B, was performed.  Images show dilated ducts bilaterally.  Intraductal round soft tissue masses are also present.  Patient underwent needle localization and open surgical biopsy of both breast lesions, and pathology revealed bilateral intraductal papillomas.  Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) was also noted at the right breast, and fibrocystic changes were present bilaterally.

24 yo man with IED blast injury from OIF with penetrating brain injury.  He underwent a decompressive right hemicraniectomy at the 10th CSH.  CT chest showed bilateral pneumothoraces and pneumomediastinum, therefore  bilateral chest tubes were placed.  Patient was then transported to LRAMC, and finally NNMC for definitive care.
A retrospective study of blast lung injury in Israel found that BLI is not commonly lethal if sufficiently treated, but a large majority (76%) require intubation and mechanical ventilation.  Out of 29 patients who met the BLI inclusion criteria of hypoxia and pulmonary infiltrates on CXR, 3 patients had pneumomediastinum and 12 patients sustained pneumothorax.  None of those patients had penetration injuries to the neck or chest.  Blast lung injury is the second most common primary blast injury (ruptured tympanic membrane is first).  The pressure wave from explosive devices causes a transient increase in intrathoracic pressure, leading to alveolar rupture and air dissecting into surrounding tissues.
On CXR, the pulmonary infiltrates found in those with BLI occur centrally (bat wing appearance), which can help differentiate from the pleural infiltrates of blunt trauma.

In approximately half the cases of PMC, pancolitis will be present (not expected in ischemia, hemorrhage, inflammatory bowel disease).  Hypoproteinemia would show other hollow viscus thickening. Radiation enteritis would correspond to the radiated port. PMC is confirmed by stool assay for C. dificile toxin.  

CT findings do not necessarily correlate with clinical severity and negative CT findings do not exclude PMC, thus a high degree of clinical suspicion must be maintained since delayed diagnosis may be fatal.

The patient in the above example had a CT 2 weeks before the prior study, showing pneumonia, but normal appearance of bowel.  After development of PMC (presumably from antibiotic tx), she was treated with antibiotics (Flagyl), with significant improvement in clinical parameters, allowing discharge.

Uterine Malformations: incidence 0.5%
Classified into mechanism of malformation: 
1. Failure of fusion of the m?llerian ducts resulting in abnormal contour of the myometrium. Complete: didelphys with separate uterine horns, vagina and cervix
Partial: bicornuate as in this case with varying degrees of partial separation of the uterus and one vagina and arcuate uterus being the mildest end of the spectrum and considered more a normal variation then a malformation.

2. Failure of resorption of septum with normal external contour.  The septate uterus extends to the cervix.  Subseptate with septum ending prior to cervix. Increased risk of infertility and spontaneous abortions with septate uterus as septum composed of more fibrous elements then myometrium and has decreased blood supply. 

3. Arrested development of the m?llerian ducts with complete uterine aplasia to partial unicornis unicollis.

Hydrometrocolpos can be seen fusion abnormalities in which there is a rudimentary horn with no communication or in didelphys with obstruction by a septum.
Other complications include malpresentation and premature labor.

Meconium ileus
Colonic atresia
This is a term baby girl status post spontaneous vaginal delivery.  The pregnancy was complicated by a positive quad screen.  Apgar scores were 3, 5, and 7 at one minute, five minutes, and ten minutes respectively.  She was transferred to NICU one day after birth to rule out congenital heart disease.  She also failed to spontaneously pass meconium; rectal stimulation was needed.
One of the most common surgical emergencies in the newborn is for bowel obstruction.  When a newborn develops abdominal distention and fails to pass his first stool, distal bowel obstruction must be suspected.  There are several different etiologies for distal bowel obstruction, and amongst the list of differentials is Hirshsprung’s disease.

Those with Down’s syndrome have a higher incidence of complications following surgery.  They have a higher risk of enterocolitis and a risk of suffering adverse cardiovascular events.
