Toddler's fracture
3 year old female with left lower extremity leg pain for 2 weeks.  No history of trauma.
Toddler fracture was first described by Dunbar et all in 1964.  It is a spiral, hair line fracture that is often not vizualized radiographically initially.  Sometimes, it can only be viewed in one veiw.  It behaves like a stress fracture and presents with normal or subtle findings.  Often the fracture is confirmed by placing the suspected limb under a torque stress.  If pain is present, the diagnosis is clarified.
