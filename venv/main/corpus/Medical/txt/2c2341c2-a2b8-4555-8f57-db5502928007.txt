Lithopedian (fetal demise, retained fetus with calcification)
Obese woman with abdominal pain for a year
Lithopedian occurs with retention of a dead fetus for months or years, resulting in dystrophic calcification.  Prolonged retention after fetal demise is unusual and may be associated with obesity - where the preganancy was not recognized.  

Described in association with ovarian pregancy.  Ovarian pregnancy is very rare and usually ruptures before the end of the first trimester.
