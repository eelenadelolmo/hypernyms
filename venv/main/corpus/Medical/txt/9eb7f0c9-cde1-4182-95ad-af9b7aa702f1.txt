Post delivery, the CCAM was resected
Within the left hemithorax is a multicystic mass that has a background parenchyma that is hyperechogenic in relationship to the contralateral lung parenchyma.  The heart is displaced to the right.  A normal stomach bubble (mildly distended) is noted in the left upper abdomen.

uncomplicated course of pregnancy presenting for second trimester anatomic screen
When detected in utero at a 18-20 week ultrasound, these masses may be quite large and are often very echogenic in the regions that are not cystic - this is in relationship to the lungs, which is one of the most echogenic of the fetal soft tissue structures.  
During the course of pregnancy, it is not uncommon for these masses to "shrink" - this is more a relationship of the fetus growing and the mass remaining about the same size.  By delivery, the CCAM may be quite small and difficult to find.  These go on to resection as they may undergo malignant transformation if left in.
