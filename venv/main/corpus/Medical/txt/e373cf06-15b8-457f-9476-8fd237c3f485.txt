Endoscopic resection
The endocervical canal was catherized in a sterile manner and the endometrial cavity distended with normal saline.  A filling defect is seen within the uterine cavity isoechoic to the endometrium.  Demonstration of a feeding vessel within the stalk is evidence that this solid structure is an actively growing tissue.  The stalk and size are most consistent with endometrial polyp.
This abnormality is radiologically consistent with an endometrial polyp.
