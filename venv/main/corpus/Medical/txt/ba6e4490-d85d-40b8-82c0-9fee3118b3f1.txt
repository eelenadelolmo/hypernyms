Exam :  Weight 56 kg (25-50 percentile), height 177 cm (75 percentile), bp in right arm sitting with dinamap 119/54 mm hg, pulse 70 ,  HEENT: unremarkable ,Extremities acyanotic without clubbing or edema, excellent pulse and perfusion with well timed brachial- femoral pulsations, precordial palpation reveal pain in the left pectoral area with palpation. Normal first and second heart sound without murmurs, clicks, gallops, or rubs. Lungs clear. Abdomen soft, nontender with hepatosplenomegaly. 

EKG showing normal sinus rhythm with 52 bpm, QT/QTc 414/385, no TWI or ST elevation noted.  Graded Exercise Stress Test  reaching maxium heart rate of 206 for total of 13 minutes reported as normal without supraventricular or ventricular ectopy, no ischemic changes or chest pain.
It was determined that the etiology if the patient’s chest pain was likely musculoskeletal in nature. Patient was advised to treatment with NSAIDs for relief. It was thought that the aberrant pulmonary artery was an incidental finding as the patient was asymptomatic in respiratory and swallowing abnormalities
Echocardiogram showing normal chamber size, normal valvular appearance and function. No indication of coarctation noted. However noted on pulmonary artery visualization noted that although main and right pulmonary artery were normal , noted that left pulmonary artery was not well visualized
Confirmation with Chest CT with contrast showing the left pulmonary artery originating from the proximal right pulmonary artery and coursed between the trachea and esophagus to supply the left lung. The finding is consistent with pulmonary sling. 
Also noted that the trachea was mildly narrowed to 9.4mm at level of sling from 15 mm above defect. Also noted to have narrowing of the right mainstem bronchus as pulmonary abnormality as well to measurement of 10 to 11 mm.  No mass in trachea or bronchi noted. Great vessels were normal in appearance.

Patient is a 15 y.o. boy who presented to the primary care office with complaint of chest pain of several weeks duration.

The chest pain is described as “pressure like” in the left pectoral area. Onset reported as random without relationship to activity, meals, or body position. Duration of pain reported as 30mins to 2 hours. Denies trauma to area.  Relief with Tylenol and moving of left arm on occasion but not complete. No reported exacerbation. Denies any other cardiovascular symptoms. Review of system positive for throat pain but no difficulty swallowing. 

Past medical history include a previous cardiac evaluation of an innocent murmur as the age of 12 years.

No medications. 

Family History is unremarkable.
Patient was found to have a pulmonary sling. Although symptomatic in infants and younger patients, most older children and adults are asymptomatic and require no further medical intervention.
