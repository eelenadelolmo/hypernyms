Radiation therapy is the usual treatment for symptomatic metastatic prostate disease, but current research is directed at the utilization of bisphosphonates. These drugs inhibit bone resorption as well as modify the microenvironment, thus making tumor growth less favorable (Eaton and Coleman).
Tc99m MCP bone scan (posterior view) show multiple areas of increased radiopharmaceutical uptake in the spine and in the left posterior sixth rib consistent with metastases from the patient’s prostate cancer.

Axial CT images (bone windows) of the chest at the level of the sixth rib shows pathologic fracture through osteolytic mass of the left posterior rib with associated pleural reaction. 

Axial CT images of the chest (bone windows) also show osteosclerotic and osteolytic metastases of the thoracic spine.  

P-A radiograph shows pathological fracture through osteolytic lesion of the left posterior sixth rib consistent with osteolytic metastasis from patient’s prostate cancer.
Metastatic prostate cancer
Metastases from prostate cancer
or rarely metastases from other cancers (lung,urinary bladder)
Paget’s disease 
Lymphoma
73-year-old man with recently diagnosed prostate cancer presents with back pain and acute onset of left-sided pleuritic chest pain.
Prostate cancer typically presents after the age of 50 years and once a patient in the United States reaches this age, his chance for developing prostate cancer increases with each decade until age 90. Ethnicity also plays a factor with the incidence of black men at 137/100,000 and white men at 101/100,000 (Boyle et al).  The usual site for metastases is the spine due to metastatic cells traveling via Batson’s plexus of veins. However, its location in comparison to the prostate is not the only reason for metastatic disease developing in the spine. According to Eaton and Coleman prostate cancer has a predilection for bone over other tissues due to “selective adherence,” in which prostatic cancer cell’s surface molecules bind to collagen derived from bone matrix. This is also why prostate metastases can be found in other bones throughout the skeleton. Once located there, the tumor will find an environment well suited for growth due to the abundance of growth factors (Berruti et al). 

While it is well known that prostate metastases are osteosclerotic, it is unusual for osteolytic lesions to be present. While the pathogenesis is still largely unknown, osteosclerotic and osteolytic lesions seem to develop due the interplay between different growth factors located in bone and the tumor cells themselves. Interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor, and parathyroid hormone related peptide for osteolytic lesions and transforming growth factor and fibroblastic growth factor for osteosclerotic (Berruti et al). 

The imaging workup for metastatic prostate cancer begins with a bone scan, which has largely replaced the skeletal survey. According to Manyak et al a bone scan detects bone metastases in 25% of patients with a normal skeletal survey. In a positive skeletal survey, 50% of bone marrow must be replaced by metastases, where only 10% of marrow needs replacement for a bone scan to be positive (Wilkinson and Hamdy). However, radiographs are still helpful when evaluating osteosclerotic metastases in order to differentiate these lesions from osteoarthritis, which is also common in the elderly male patient and can produce a positive bone scan but usually in the periarticular areas.
