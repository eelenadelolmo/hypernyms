Cervical Spine plain film radiographs, CT, and MRI ordered.
A metallic plate and screws were surgically placed along the anterior portions of C4 and C6 in order to realign the avulsed portion of C5 with the rest of the vertebral body.  Follow-up consisted of plain film radiograph to insure anatomic alignment of the avulsed fragment of C5.
On both the plain film radiograph and the CT there is a C-5 fracture with anterior and inferior displacement of a fragment of the vertebral body.  Both also reveal a small amount of disk space narrowing at the level of C5-C6, with the CT demonstrating a slight posterior displacement of the posterior fragment into the spinal canal.  MRI reveals the previously mentioned fracture, as well as soft tissue edema surrounding the posterior spinal ligaments from C3-C6.  Also revealed is a broad based disk bulge at C5-C6 which contacts the thecal sac, but does not compress the cord, nor is there evidence of abnormal signal intensities.  There is some bone marow edema adjacent to the fracture site.
Cervical spine fracture, simple (compression) type.
Cervical spine fracture, simple wedge (compression) type.
Cervical Spine fracture, teardrop type.
Patient presents to the ER with a complaint of neck pain.
Upon examination of the MRI and plain film radiographs it is evident there is an avulsed piece of bone shaped like a wedge.  According to Greenspan, referred to in the factoid for this case, a simple wedge is the diagnosis that comes to mind.  This type of fracture generally results from hyperflexion of the mid-cervical or lower cervical spine.  The posterior ligament complex may be stretched, but its integrity is intact.  This gives the patient a stable fracture.

Another possibility is a teardrop fracture, a much more concerning fracture.  Re Greenspan, it is the most severe and unstable fracture, with dangerous implications.  This fracture is characterized by posterior displacement of the involved vertebra into the spinal canal, fracture of its posterior elements, and disruption of the ligamentum flavum and spinal cord.  The anterior longitudinal ligament is also placed under stress, and may rupture from the vertebral body, taking an anteror piece of the bone along with it.  This results in the "teardrop" shape.  The fragment is usually diplaced anteriorly and inferiorly, similar to the images on the radiographic studies.

The difference in this case lies in both the physical and radiographic findings.  The diagnosis of a simple wedge fracture can be confirmed by the studies done, and the radiological findings and physical symptoms are consistent with what would be expected in this type of injury.

A teardrop fracture should be considered, and the possibility of either spinous process or posterior vertebrae fractures pursued.  However, with the report from the ER was only "neck pain", implying the patient may not have had any deficits normally expected with either cord impingements or physical exam findings indicative of damage on the scale of the teardrop fracture.  It is far more likely that there are no posterior findings and that the fracture is (fortunately for him) a stable, simple wedge fracture.
