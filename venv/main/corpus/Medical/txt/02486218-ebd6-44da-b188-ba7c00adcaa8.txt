11 month old male with nystagmus
Callsoal abnormalities:
Agenesis: Complete absence of the corpus callosum
Partial agenesis or hypoplasia: The corpus forms in a front to back pattern.  With partial agenesis the front aspects of the corpus (genu and anterior body) are formed
Dysgenesis: An abnormality in development typically seen in holoprosencephaly.  This case does not appear to be a holoprosencephlay in that there is a normal interhemispheric fissure, and there are 2 anterior cerebral arteries (as opposed to the azygous ACA seen in holoprosencephaly). Most likely this case represents an intrauterine event that affected the anterior fibers crossing.
