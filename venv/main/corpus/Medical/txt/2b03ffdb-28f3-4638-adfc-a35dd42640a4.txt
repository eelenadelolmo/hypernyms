Lesion extends from genu to splenium of corpus callosum. T1 bright/T2 bright/Supressed on t1 post-gadolinium fat saturation sequence. Axial CT images demonstrate attenuation equivalent to fat.
Lipoma of the corpus callosum.
T1W High Signal Intensity
- blood (methemoglobin), lipid, protein, melanin, microcalcification

Corpus Callosum Lesions
- white matter disease
- infiltrating neoplasm (glioma, lymphoma)
- agenesis
- lipoma
6 month history of intermittent headaches and nausea.
The diagnosis of corpus callosum lipoma can be straightforward.  Watch for additional lesions of partial agenesis of the corpus callosum and curvilinear  rim calcification surrounding the lipoma.
