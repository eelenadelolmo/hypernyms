Currently hemodynamically stable with no direct chest trauma evident.
A normal variant of a prominent azygos vein and lobe warranted no further work-up and the treatement of the patient's multiple orthopedic injuries became the next therapeutic priority.
The mediastinum appears widened without evidence of rib
fractures nor an apical cap.  On a subsequent non-contrast CT of the chest there is an incidental azygous fissure and associated vein which cause the
apparent mediastinal widening on plain radiography.  No aortic transection or pseudoanyeursm is evident.
Azygos lobe
A diffential diagnosis for mediastinal widening would include rupture of the aorta and/or brachicephalic arteries/veins, aortic anyeursm/pseudoanyeursm, prominence of the SVC, rupture of the esophagus or thoracic duct, adenopathy, bronchogenic duplication cyst, tumor/inflamation, or prominence of the azygous vein.
