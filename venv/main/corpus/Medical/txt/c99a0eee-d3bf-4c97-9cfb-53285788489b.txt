Surgery is the treatment for pheochromocytoma.
1) NONCONTRAST IMAGES - Bilateral adrenal enlargement/thickening with distal nodular thickening of the medial branch of the right adrenal. HU > 10 bilaterally. Homogeneous attenuation with no calcifications bilaterally.
2) 50 SEC POST CONTRAST IMAGES - Dense homogeneous enhancement of the bilateral adrenals. HU 115 left and right. 
3) 15 MIN POST CONTRAST IMAGES - HU @ 74 bilaterally. Delayed washout of contrast is demonstrated. This is consistent with a non-adenomatous process. 
4) I-123 MIBG 24 HR SPECT IMAGE, CORONAL PLANE - Bilateral adrenal uptake of MIBG. (Confirmed in AXIAL and SAGITTAL planes as right adrenal versus gallbladder).
