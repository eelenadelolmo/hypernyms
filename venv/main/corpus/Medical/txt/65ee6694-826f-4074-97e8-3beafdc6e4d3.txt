Treatment: 
Grade   		         
I-II	Initial Rx: Antibiotic Prophylaxis

III-IV	Initial Rx: Antibiotic Prophylaxis
______If >6yrs & bilateral: Surgery		 
______Follow up Rx: Surgery

V	Initial Rx: <1yrs - Antibiotic Prophylaxis
__1-5yrs & unilateral: Antibiotic Prophylaxis
__1-5yrs & bilateral or renal scarring present: Surgery
__>6yrs: Surgery
__Follow up Rx: Surgery

Non surgical management includes urine cultures every 4 months & when febrile, as well as antibiotic prophylaxis.  Amoxicillin is recommended in infants less than 2 months of age, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or nitrofurantoin in children greater than 2 months.  If VUR has not resolved within 12-18 months or breakthrough pyelonephritis occurs while on prophylaxis, surgical correction is indicated.
VCUG Findings:
Early filling views demonstrated no filling defects or ureteroceles.  There
was bilateral vesicoureteral reflux to the level of the collecting systems,
left greater than right.  There was mild dilatation of the collecting system
as well as blunting of the calyces.  The patient spontaneously voided. 
Post-void images continued to demonstrate contrast within the ureters
and collecting system as well as bladder.
 
IMPRESSION:
Bilateral grade III vesicoureteral reflux, slightly worse on the left.
Vesicoureteral Reflux (Grade III)
8 wk old female with left renal caliectasis (8mm) diagnosed on prenatal US, resolved to 6mm on US at 6wks of life
Vesicoureteral Reflux(VUR)

Definition – Retrograde flow of urine from the bladder into the upper urinary tract.

Grade I : Ureter only
Grade II: Ureter, pelvis, calyces; no dilation, normal calyceal fornices
Grade III:  Mild dilation of ureter; mild or moderate dilation of the pelvis, but minimal blunting of the fornices.
Grade IV: Moderate dilation of the ureter; mild dilation of renal pelvis and calyces; complete obliteration of sharp angle of fornices, but maintenance of papillary impressions in majority of calyces
Grade V: Gross dilation and tortuosity of ureter; gross dilation of renal pelvis and calyces; papillary impressions are no longer visible in majority of calyces

Significance – retrograde flow of urine from the bladder to the upper urinary tract facilitates the transport of bacteria.  This results in a predisposition to pyelonephritis.  Multiple episodes of pyelonephritis leads to renal scarring resulting in complications such as renal insufficiency and hypertension.
