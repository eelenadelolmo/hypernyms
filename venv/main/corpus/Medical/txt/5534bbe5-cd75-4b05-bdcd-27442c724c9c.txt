An MRI showed a large right cerebellar mass with effacement of the fourth ventricle and hydrocephalus.  Subtotal resection of the mass was performed.
Fig 1. Axial T1 weighted MRI shows coarse striations resulting from irregular, abnormally thickened cerebellar folia.

Fig 2. Axial T2 weighted MRI also showing the same coarse striations resulting from abnormally thick cerebellar folia.

This 56 year old woman had breast carcinoma for which she  had bilateral mastectomies six years apart. She also had a thyroidectomy in her twenties. Six years after the second mastectomy, she developed gait unsteadiness that progressed to the point that she was unable to walk.
The associated breast cancer and thyroid disease form the constellation of findings known as Cowden disease - an autosomal dominant phakomatosis.
