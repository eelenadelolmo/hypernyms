47 y/o man presents with scrotal "crackles" and diffuse abdominal pain.
This 47-year-old man has a longstanding history of colonic Crohn's disease. A diverting ileostomy was done four years ago but he has persistent strictures in the colon and rectum;and, these have been endoscopically dilated multiple times. Despite recommendations by  Gastroenterology for a total colectomy, the patient had not been convinced. He has, therefore, been managed medically with steroids, Remicade, and so forth, and has had periodic endoscopic dilations of the strictures. Prior to presentation to the emergency room for diffuse abdominal pain, he had three separate strictures dilated, apparently at 15, 25, and 35 cm from the anus. Afterwards, he had abdominal pain and subcutaneous emphysema and a subsequent chest x-ray showed massive free air so an emergency Surgical consultation was obtained.
