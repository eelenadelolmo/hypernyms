There are multiple plaque-like lesions in the mid and distal esophagus.  Note how the plaques have discrete borders and a predominantly longitudinal orientation.  Following treatment with ketoconazole, a repeat esophagram one week later shows virtually complete healing of the lesions (Film .2).

Candida esophagitis usually occurs in immunosuppressed patients with odynophagia (i.e., pain on swallowing) or dysphagia (i.e., difficulty swallowing).  About 50% of patients have associated oropharyngeal candidiasis (i.e., thrush).  Double contrast radiographs typically reveal discrete plaque-like lesions corresponding to the characteristic white plaques seen at endoscopy.  The lesions tend to be longitudinally oriented, appearing en face as linear or irregular filling defects with normal intervening mucosa.  These plaque-like lesions can be detected on double contrast esophagrams in about 90% of patients with Candida esophagitis.  Occasionally, undissolved effervescent agent, air bubbles, or debris in the esophagus can be mistaken for the plaques of esophageal candidiasis (Film .3).  If an artifact is suspected, however, additional double contrast radiographs should be obtained to demonstrate the transient nature of these findings.

With progression, the esophagus may have a grossly irregular or "shaggy" contour due to multiple plaques, pseudomembranes, and ulcers (Film .4).  Ulceration results primarily from sloughing of pseudomembranes in patients with advanced disease.  Thus, ulceration in Candida esophagitis is almost always associated with extensive plaque formation and rarely occurs on an otherwise normal background mucosa.  The worsening AIDS epidemic has led to a much more fulminant form of candidiasis, with a dramatic increase in the number of patients who have a shaggy esophagus on barium studies.  Occasionally, these individuals may present with a shaggy esophagus as the initial manifestation of their disease, so that the radiologist is the first to suggest the diagnosis of AIDS.  Because this degree of esophagitis rarely occurs in other immunocompromised patients, the possibility of AIDS should be suspected when a shaggy esophagus is detected on barium studies, particularly in young homosexual men.
