She was noted to have lytic lesions in the vertebral bodies on a high-resolution chest CT.  Biopsy was performed of the seventh vertebral body. Biopsy demonstrated atypical plasma cells with the characteristic plasma cell phenotype +CD38 and cytokeratin negative.
CT-guided biopsy of the seventh thoracic vertebral body lytic lesion was performed.  Other lesions were seen at T3 and T12 (not depicted).

Subsequently, MRI of the spine was performed.  Here, multiple lesions are seen on both T1- and T2-weighted sagittal images which are hypointense compared to the vertebral bodies
