Musculoskeletal: Gait: Partial weight-bearing with crutches.  Inspection: L. knee with mild effusion, no ecchymosis, skin intact, diffuse tenderness especially along medial and lateral joint lines, medial/lateral facet and superior/inferior pole of the patella.  Quadriceps mechanism intact, no calf pain.  ROM: L. Knee - 0-90, full ROM of L. hip.  Stability: L. Knee -- negative Lachman but with guarding, laxity with anterior drawer testing with firm end point, negative posterior drawer testing, negative patellar apprehension, varus/valgus stress not tested.

Neurological: DTR: 1+ knee and ankle jerks, no loss of sensation.
In determining the need for total knee arthroplasty for him, clinical and radiological factors were considered.  He stated that prior to his MVA his left knee did not cause him trouble; after the accident he noted constant severe pain refractory to analgesics and NSAIDs.  Physical exam noted significant varus deformity, joint effusion, and diffuse tenderness.  Plain film and MRI demonstrated significant joint disease consistent with osteoarthritis, as well as chronic tears of the ACL, PCL, and medial and lateral menisci.
	
Images point to a chronic process, likely facilitated by his morbid obesity and long history of right knee pain putting significant stress on his left knee.  It is possible that his MVA caused enough acute damage to his left knee to raise his pain level to a significant degree.  
	
In discussions with his orthopedic surgeon, it was agreed that total knee arthroplasty was clearly indicated.  However, the surgeon wanted to complete a three month trial of physical therapy in order to ensure that his pain was refractory to non-surgical treatment; the surgeon cited instances of patients with radiographs which looked as bad or worse than his, who ultimately improved with PT and did not require surgery.  The surgeon also suggested weight loss, explaining that his morbid obesity and young age would lead to significant stress being placed on the prosthesis and a higher likelihood of failure.  The surgeon’s recommendation was bariatric surgery.
	
Because he is in significant and constant pain, it is unlikely he will be able to complete three months of PT or the long process associated with bariatric surgery.  As of the writing of this case, he was considering taking steps to expedite his arthroplasty.  While he fits the demographic most likely to need revision – male, younger than 55, and morbidly obese—improvements in prosthetic parts have lessened the incidence of failure in this population.  Given his significant pain, immediate elective total knee arthroplasty is a reasonable option.  JR illustrates the fact that the decision to perform TKA must take into account multiple factors and has to be individualized to each patient.
MRI KNEE LT: No fractures, dislocations, or acute bone abnormalities seen.  Severe osteoarthritic changes of knee joine, most extensive in medial and lateral aspects with associated numerous loose intraarticular bodies.  Severe maceration and complex tears and disorganization of medial and lateral menisci, chronic complex tears of ACL and PCL.  Tendinopathy of distal patellar ligament seen.  Joint effusion seen.

PLAIN FILM KNEE LT: Tricompartmental loss of joint space, numerous osteophytes
Severe Osteo-Arthropathy (osteoarthritis)
• Osteoarthritis
• Acute trauma
• Charcot Joint

A 50-year-old morbidly obese man with a prior history of right knee pain who was involved in a motor vehicle accident in September.  He was the belted driver of a vehicle stopped in an intersection when another vehicle struck his vehicle on the driver side.  He reported that his head and his entire left side including his left knee were impacted by the door, but he did not lose consciousness.  He was taken to the ER and released after imaging was done and pain medications were prescribed.  He presently notes the new onset of left knee pain both with movement and at rest, as well as neck, thoracolumbar and lower back pain.  He also notes headaches.
PMH: Diabetes, borderline hypertension, morbid obesity
PSH: exploratory surgery on volar aspect of left elbow, unspecified chest surgery at 14 years old, tonsillectomy
Medications: Metformin, Cardizem, Mobic, Aspirin, Lortab, Methadone
