Sensorineural hearing loss.
Radiation therapy and now gamma knife procedures can be done.
Large tumor of the left vascular space which displaces adjacent vessels. Condylar and basilar portions of the occipital bone are eroded. The lesion is slightly hypointense to gray matter on T1 and vigorously enhances following contrast administration. A salt and pepper appearance is noted.
Glomus jugulare tumor (presumptive - no biopsy)
Glomus jugulare - most likely given slow growth, "salt and pepper" appearance with contrast, and vigorous contrast enhancement
Schwannoma - delayed enhancement and prolongedcontrast properties not characteristic
Meningioma - delayed imaging was not performed thus cannot rule out based on enhancement characteristics alone
78 yo male with prior history significant for squamous cell carcinoma (T1N0M0) of the true vocal cord 20 years prior now with loss of hearing in the left ear for several months
Was previously diagnosed (as long ago as 1995) with acoustic shwannoma and has been treated once with gamma knife therapy. Enhancement characteristics and "salt and pepper" appearance more characteristic of paraganglioma.
