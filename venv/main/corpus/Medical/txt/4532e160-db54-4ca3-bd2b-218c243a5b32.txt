Tenderness to palpation in the anatomical snuff box.
This patient received an open reduction and internal fixation repair of his scaphoid fracture 2 days after the diagnosis was made.
1. A transverse lucency is present within the mid-body of the left scaphoid consistent with a fracture. Lucency is best appreciated on the dorsal palmar view.  No other fractures are evident. A subchondral cyst is noted within the ulnar aspect of the right lunate bone.  Visualized osseous structures display normal mineralization. Visualized soft tissue structures are remarkable for swelling surrounding the left scaphoid fracture.

2. There has been interval ORIF of the scaphoid bone with an interosseous screw which traverses a mid body fracture lucency.  No new fractures are evident.  There is overlying casting material.

Scaphoid Fracture
39 year-old male with fall from motorcycle.
While prompt immobilization is usually sufficient to ensure healing of scaphoid fractures with 1 mm or less of displacement, this patient received an ORIF, likely due to a few days of delay in presentation for evaluation as is common in our active duty population.
