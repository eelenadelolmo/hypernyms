Physical exam was significant only for an abdomen that was diffusely tender to palpation, more so in the lower abdomen.  Bowel sounds were hypoactive.  There was no guarding, rebound tenderness, organomegaly, or mass appreciated on exam.  laboratory findings were significant only for a WBC = 14.6 K.
Air enema was performed with fluoroscopy in an attempt to relieve the intussusception.  The colon was insufflated, and the intussusceptum was encountered in the transverse colon.  Relief was achieved upon the fourth attempt.  The intussusception did not recur within the first 24 hours.  At this point, the intussusception was presumed to be due secondarily to the patient&#39;s pancreatic insufficiency.  If this were to recur, a further workup would be performed to search for a lead-point lymphoma or different etiology.  If it were to have recurred, the patient would need to be further considered for surgical intervention.  Marked atrophy of the pancreas, as seen in this patient, is consistent with pancreatic insufficiency, a risk factor for colonic intussusception in CF patients.
Cystic fibrosis is evidenced in CT by signs of inspissated mucus, leading to pancreatic atrophy.  In both axial and sagittal sections, evidence of ileocecal intussusception can be seen with the small bowel bringing with it the vessels, fat, and appendix.  A lack of air in the colon is also notable, with no definitively identifiable lead point.  then, with the use of fluoroscopy, the intussusceptum was completely reduced after the fourth attempt by air enema.  Air can be seen as evidenced by multiple dilated loops of small bowel.
Intussusception.  Pancreatic atrophy from cystic fibrosis
Based on history and physical exam findings, the differential diagnosis would include all of the following:
-appendicitis
-gastroenteritis
-hernia
-intussusception
-volvulus
-malignancy
-adhesion
-Meckel diverticulum
-upper UTI
10 y.o. boy was playing basketball with friends early in the morning of admission and was elbowed in his abdomen.  He immediately experienced RLQ and periumbilical pain, which did not subside.  The pain was not associated with nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, or diarrhea.  He was seen at an outside facility, where a CT was performed, prior to being transferred to the children&#39;s hospital. He has a known autosomal recessive condition.
