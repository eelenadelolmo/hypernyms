The prognosis of babies born with VACTERL syndromes is dependent upon the severity of the anomalies. The survival of babies with VACTER association has gradually increased with better management of anomalies.  At birth, babies with urinary tract abnormalities should started on antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infection while awaiting completion of screening.  Surgeons are more likely to repair cardiac and intestinal tract anomalies shortly after birth.
