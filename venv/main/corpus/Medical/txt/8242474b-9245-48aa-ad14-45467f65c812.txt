Vitals:  T 101.0F, HR 88 (with beta blockade), BP 113/50, RR 28, Sa 97% 2L NC
Exam: Generally ill-appearing, distended abdomen without bowel sounds, tympanitic and tender diffusely, peritoneal signs

An emergent total colectomy with ileostomy placement was performed on hospital day two.  The patient had a 10-day postoperative intensive care unit stay complicated by sepsis.  She slowly recovered over a period of 21 days and was discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation facility.
Supine Abdominal Film:  There is a large amount of air and stool seen throughout the colon.  The colon is diffusely dilated.  The cecum is dilated to 11.5cm.  The transverse colon is dilated to 9.5cm.  There is air seen to the level of the rectum.  

CT, Abdomen/Pelvis with Intravenous and Enteric Contrast:  There is diffuse dilation of the colon with air and fluid levels present. There is diffuse wall thickening and enhancement in the rectosigmoid colon. The descending, transverse, and ascending colon are dilated to as much as 8.5cm.  The colonic wall enhances, but is not abnormally thickened.  There is contrast within the small bowel.  A small amount of air is seen within the small bowel and terminal ileum.  There is no evidence of perforation or extraluminal process.

This 83 year-old African-American female with a past medical history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, and type II diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency room with one week of constipation.  The patient had fallen 2 weeks prior to this presentation and by her report had been placed on acetaminophen/oxycodone for pain in her right knee.  Shortly thereafter, the frequency of her stools decreased.  At presentation, the patient had not passed stool in 5 days.    Of note, the patient was admitted about one month prior for hyponatremia that was complicated by Clostridium difficile colitis.  The patient was still receiving oral vancomycin for treatment.  On arrival, she denied any abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, recent diarrhea, abdominal distension, dark or bloody stools, or bright red blood per rectum.    
     Evaluation by the emergency physician noted a heart rate >150 beats per minute.  An electrocardiogram showed new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  The patient was admitted to the cardiac care unit for further evaluation of the new dysrhythmia.  An acute abdominal series was obtained on admission for evaluation of constipation.
     Over the first night of admission, the dysrhythmia spontaneously converted to sinus tachycardia.  The patient had two large solid bowel movements, but then developed severe diffuse abdominal pain and distension with altered mental status by morning.  A surgical consult and further imaging were obtained.
Simply put, toxic megacolon is diffuse colonic dilatation combined with clinical evidence of toxicity.  This condition has multiple causes including inflammatory bowel disease, (traditionally ulcerative colitis), infectious colitis, (most notably Clostridium difficile in hospitalized patients), and malignancy.  Frequently, an exacerbating factor is present in addition to the predisposing condition.  These factors can include, but are not limited to, abrupt cessation of either steroids or smoking in ulcerative colitis patients, use of narcotics, use of anticholinergics, or electrolyte disturbances.  
Presenting symptoms range from bloody diarrhea to obstipation, with severe abdominal pain and distension.  Physical examination will likely show an ill-appearing patient with absent bowel sounds, and a tympanitic abdomen.  Signs of peritoneal inflammation may be present as well.  In 1969, Jalan established criteria for clinical toxicity.  These require that a patient present with any three of the following: fever >101.5°F (>38.6°C), heart rate >120 beats/min, white blood cell count >10.5, or anemia. Patients will likely also have evidence of dehydration, mental status changes, electrolyte disturbances, or hypotension.  
The diagnosis of colonic dilatation can be made by plain radiograph, but patients may also undergo computed tomography (CT).  Findings suggestive of toxic megacolon on plain film include dilatation of the transverse colon >6cm with or without small bowel distension.  A CT scan may reveal colonic wall thickening, pericolic stranding, or evidence of perforation or abscess formation.
Medical management begins with fluid resuscitation, colonic decompression with nasointestinal tube and/or rectal tube, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and frequent repositioning to prevent air collections in one area of colon.  Abdominal radiographs should be repeated frequently.  Surgical intervention is often required.  Indications for total colectomy include perforation, and progressive toxicity or dilatation despite appropriate medical care.
