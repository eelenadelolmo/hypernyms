Recent laboratory: Alkaline Phosphate 301 U/L 
(Normal 38-126), Other basic lab results normal.
Tx: biphosphonates (older tx calcitonin)
Focal radiotracer uptake within the right hemi-pelvis. Diffuse radiotracer uptake within the right shoulder and lower lumbar spine consistent with degenerative changes.

Radiograph of the pelvis demonstrates dense sclerotic trabeculae and lytic areas within the right pelvis. There is mild cortical expansion.

Radiograph of the skull demonstrates focal lucency across the anterior portion of the skull consistent with osteoporosis circumscripta.

77 year old with “abnormal prior skull radiograph…bone pain…concern for metastatic disease.”
Disorder of middle-aged/older individuals. (3% over 40)
Causes bone pain, tenderness. Increased risk of osteosarcoma

Bony proliferation disease characterized by excessive and abnormal remodeling of bone: sclerosis, thickened trabeculae, and enlargement.

3 Phases: Lytic, Mixed lytic-sclerotic, Sclerotic
Viral etiology has been considered.
Elevated alkaline phosphatase, 20% monostotic

Tx: biphosphonates (older tx calcitonin)

Bone scintigraphy:can be used to diagnose, evaluate extent, and evaluate treatment with biphosphonates.

Findings: Increased uptake along cortico-medulary bone, sharp leading edge “flame-shaped” or “blade-of-grass”, bony enlargement, bowing of femur. 

Location: Skull, tubular bones (diaphysis), pelvis, spine.
