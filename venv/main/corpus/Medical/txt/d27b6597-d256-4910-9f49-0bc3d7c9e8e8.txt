Tachypnea.  No abnormal laboratory findings.

Imaging Findings:  Abnormal CXR on day 1 of life demonstrates consolidative changes of the right upper lobe.  Second set of images obtained on day 6 of life suggests small cystic changes within a persistent area of consolidation in the mid and upper right chest and CT is recommended.  CT shows a mixed solid and cystic mass in the right upper chest involving the right upper lobe consistent with cystic adenomatoid malformation.
Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation Type 1 (CPAM 1)
• CCAM (CPAM)
• pneumonia with cavitary lesion
• pulmonary sequestration

• congenital diaphragmatic hernia
• congenital lobar emphysema
• pulmonary interstitial emphysema
• bronchogenic cyst

Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation (CCAM) is now considered to be part of a spectrum of Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformations or CPAMs.

• Subtypes and correlations between CPAM and CCAM:
» CPAM type O - CCAM type O (acinar dysplasia)
» CPAM type 1 - CCAM type 1 (bronchial/bronchiolar)
» CPAM type 2 - CCAM type 2 (bronchiolar)
» CPAM type 3 - CCAM type 3 (bronchiolar/alveolar duct)
» CPAM type 4 - CCAM type 4 (peripheral)
» CPAM type 5 - CCAM type 5
