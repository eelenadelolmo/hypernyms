ULTRASOUND EQUIALENT OF 'FACELESS KIDNEY SIGN'.

HYPERTROPHIED COLUMN OF BERTIN -These are group of renal pseudotumors characterised by focal displacement of the collecting system within kidney of normal contour.
They usually occur in the presence of partial or complete duplication of pelvicalyceal system.
Mass effect seen most frequently ,although not invariably in the area between the upper and inter polar areas of the kidney.
In many instances what causes this mass effect is normal septal cortex tissue that has persisted during lobar fusion and in the process has become relatively prominent.

LOBAR DYSMORPHISM - This is another form of pseudotumor that is very similar to large cloison .Here a complete though diminutive lobe is situated atypically deep within the renal substance.
As with septum of bertin this is associated with duplication of the collecting system and will focally displace the pelvis or calyces.
 
NODULAR COMPENSATORY HYPERTROPHY -In the presence of focal renal scarring , areas of unaffected normal renal tissue will undergo compensatory hypertrophy.Focal enlargement of deeply situated septal cortex has ben described in analgesic nephropathy.

LOBAR INFARCTION - Edematous phase of acute renal infarction can simulate faceless kidney appearance.Also pyelonepritis ca n cause similar appearance.Doppler sonography will show these aras as hypovascular.

TUMORS - Renal cell carcinoma , and aother solid tumors of kidney including metstasis can show smilar imaging findings.

INFILTRATIVE DISEASES -Neoplastic cell infiltration generally cause bilateral diffuse renal enlargement.However rarely leukemia causes unifocal renal mass due to a chloroma ,myeloblastoma, myeloblastic sarcoma.
