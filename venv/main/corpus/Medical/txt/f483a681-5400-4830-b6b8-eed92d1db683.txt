Patient had subjective weakness of the deltoid not present on physical exam. He reported occasional transient pain with shoulder extension also not present on exam with passive or active motion. No restricted range of motion.
Patient has been instructed to immobilize the joint for 3 weeks with a sling which is removed only for bathing. Patient also has been directed to attend physical therapy twice a week for a month and to continue strengthening exercises at home once the sling is removed. Patient is unlikely to have the injury recur and does not need continuous follow up.
1. Pre-reduction plain film: shows subcoracoid dislocation of the humeral head
2. Post-reduction plain film: shows humeral head in appropriate position, no abnormalities are noted.
3. MRI at superior middle and inferior levels of the joint show Hill Sachs deformity of superior lateral humeral head on the superior image. Posterior superior and anterior inferior tears of the labrum are seen on the superior and inferior MRIs respectively.

Chronic instability of shoulder joint
Patient is 45 yo male with 4 week history of right shoulder pain following an acute injury. He reports falling backwards on partially abducted externally rotated right arm.
Plain radiograph fairly sensitive for Hill Sachs but MRI is superior. In this patient's case, the MRI findings will most likely not change the management. Age over 40 years at first dislocation is associated with labral pathology in 40% of cases but recurrence is relatively uncommon (14%).  If osseus Bankart fractures were seen or more serious soft tissue labral pathology identified, surgery may have been indicated. See Topic Discussion for further details.
