There is an oval lesion with mild diffuse heterogeneous enhancement centered in the distal aspect of the vastus medialis muscle.  The lesion measures 4.7 x 4.3 x 7.7 cm in AP, transverse and craniocaudal dimension respectively.  It is homogeneously bright on T2/STIR images.  There is a thin fat rind surrounding the tumor seen best on T1.  There is intramuscular edema at the cranial and caudal poles of the tumor seen best on fluid sensitive sequences.  Ultrasound images demonstrate a lesion which is hypoechoic relative to adjacent skeletal muscle and heterogeneous with a well defined margin.  Increased through transmission is noted.
