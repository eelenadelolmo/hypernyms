Palpable non-tender mass at the midline of the anterior neck.
Surgical resection.
Well-defined hypodense lesion along the right paramidline anterior neck at the level of the thyroid cartilage and imbedded within the strap muscles.  It has internal fluid attenuation.  No nodular focus or calcification is demonstrated.  This lesion measures 2.8cm transverse by 2.2cm AP.
Thyroglossal Duct Cyst
• Lingual or sublingual thyroid
• Thyroid carcinoma
• Dermoid or epidermoid of tongue
• Submandibular of sublingual space abscess
• Mixed laryngocele
• Thyroglossal duct cyst
65 year-old man with a firm neck mass for three months.
A thyroglossal duct cyst is a remnant of the thyroglossal duct found between the foramen cecum of the tongue base and the thyroid in the infrahyoid neck. Its formation is secondary to failure of involution of the thyroglossal duct and persistent secretion of epithelial cells lining the duct. They can occur anywhere along the route of descent of the thyroglossal duct. Thyroglossal duct cysts are the most common congenital neck lesion, being three times as common as branchial cleft cyst.

Thyroglossal duct cysts most commonly present at a doughy compressible painless neck mass along the midline or paramedian in a child or young adult. 90% present at less than 10 years of age. Other signs and symptoms include recurrent appearance of neck mass with upper respiratory tract infections or trauma.  Often, the patient will have a history of multiple prior incision & drainage procedures for “neck abcess”.  A rapidly enlarging mass suggests either infection of associated differentiated thyroid carcinoma.  Any associated nodularity or chunky calcification suggests associated thyroid carcinoma.

A thyroglossal duct cyst presents as a midline cystic neck mass imbedded within the infrahyoid strap muscles, “claw sign”. 50% of the time they are found at the level of the hyoid bone, 25% on the infrahyoid neck and 25% timed at the suprahyoid neck. There usually to 2-4 cm in size and are round or ovoid. On contrast-enhanced CT it appears low density mass, occasionally with internal septations and a thin rim of peripheral enhancement. They are anechoic on ultrasound evaluation.
