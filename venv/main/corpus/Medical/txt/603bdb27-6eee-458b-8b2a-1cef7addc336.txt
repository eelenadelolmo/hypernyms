Hypoxia. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
Admitted to the hospital for diuresis and control of her heart rhythm.  Further evaluation with echocardiography revealed severe mitral stenosis.  A valvuloplasty is planned.
Multiple images demonstrate an enlarged left atrium partially filled with thrombus and radiographic findings consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension, cephalization of pulmonary blood flow, peribronchial cuffing, Kerley lines and pleural effusion.  Together, these descibe congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema.  In this case, the patient is experiencing an acute exacerbation secondary to atrial fibrillation.  There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism on this study but the patient is at high risk for a thromboembolic event.
Cardiogenic pulmonary edema â€“ CHF exacerbation secondary to new onset atrial fibrillation.  Findings were confirmed with EKG analysis and echocardiography.
Congestive heart failure
Pulmonary embolism
Valvular heart disease
Myocardial infarction
43 y/o woman under evaluation in the Emergency Department for a three day history of dyspnea on exertion. No history of chest pain.
This patient has no known significant prior medical history but she has likely suffered chronic venous hypertension secondary to mitral stenosis for many years.  Rheumatic heart disease is a common cause of mitral stenosis.  Mitral stenosis may present with radiographic findings of left atrial enlargement while the patient is asymptomatic.  Occassionally, undetected mitral stenosis and atrial enlargement may present as acute and rapidly fatal cardiac failure.  

As shown here, underlying valvular disease and chronic venous hypertension has likely caused pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Acutely, the patient developed atrial fibrillation that led to pulmonary edema.  This is illustrated by cephalization, effusion and Kerley lines.  The enlarged left atrium is unmistakeable and the large thrombus within it may complicate the plan to correct the patient's chief underlying problem - her stenotic mitral valve.
