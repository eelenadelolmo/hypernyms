Quantitative HCG 45,000.
Left adnexa tubal pregnancy at approximately 7 weeks gestation. Layering blood within cul-de sac.
Ectopic Pregnancy (within left fallopian tube).
Cystic Adnexal Mass:
Ectopic pregnancy
Cystadenoma / Cystadenocarcinoma
Tuboovarian abscess
Hydrosalpinx
Dermoid
Pregnant female with crampy abdominal pain.
This case illustrates how intrauterine contents may easily “mimic” a normal early pregnancy on greyscale, and was originally presented to resident and attending by the technician as a “normal IUP.”  On the original scan, a “left adnexa” picture was also provided by the technician, which did not include the cystic adnexal mass (ectopic).  Sequential evaluation of each area (uterus and adnexa) with greyscale and color flow are of paramount importance.

While the differential diagnosis for an adnexal mass is broad (see above), the combination of absence of IUP, a positive HCG (45,000 in this case), and adnexal mass with decidual sac and contained yolk sac and fetal pole with beating heart secures the diagnosis.
