Details not known
Hemangioma of the left posterolateral aspect of C7 vertebral body extending superiorly and inferiorly into the spinal canal resulting in posteromedial displacement of the cord.  The nerve roots are uninvolved.  The left neural foramen is not expanded.
Hemangioma - based on imaging characteristics
(no tissue obtained)
Nerve sheath tumor such as schwannoma or neurofibroma.
Left arm radicular symptoms referred from outside facility where prior scan had suggested diagnosis of nerve sheath tumor.
A schwannoma or neurofibroma should envelop the nerve root causing nerve root expansion with eventual widening of the neural foramen.  This lesion does neither and is seen in physical and signal continuity with the hemangioma at C7.  See the related factoid for discussion of imaging characteristics of an hemangioma.
