Small asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic lesions can be treated conservatively with routine follow up and supportive care.  Larger symptomatic lesions may be resected at their base where there is continuity with the underlying bone.
Axial CT of the proximal femurs with bone windows show a 1.5 x 2.0 cm osseous lesion projects off of the anterior aspect of the left proximal femur just below the greater trochanter.  The lesion demonstrates medullary and cortical continuity with the normal bone.
Osteochondroma
Hereditary Multiple Exostoses (when multiple)
The patient denied any pain in his hips or thighs.  The lesion in his left femur was an asymptomatic incidental finding.
The femoral bone lesion in this case demonstrates continuity with the underlying bone cortex and medullary canal which is pathognomonic for an osteochondroma.  This is a single osteochondroma.  If multiple osteochondromas were seen in this patient, hereditary multiple exostoses  would be the diagnosis.  Osteochondromas enlarge from growth at the cartilage cap.  Upon reaching skeletal maturity, osteochondromas usually exhibit no further growth.  Solitary osteochondromas are estimated to occur in 1-2% of individuals undergoing routine radiographic evaluation.  These lesions constitute 20-50% of benign bone tumors and 10-15% of all bone tumors.  As in this case, most osteochondromas are asymptomatic.  Symptomatic lesions usually occur in younger patients.  The most common symptoms is a nontender, painless cosmetic deformity related to enlarging exophytic mass.  The patient in this case was a male, and solitary osteochondromas have a male predilection ranging from 1.6-3.4 to 1 as compared to women.   50% of osteochondromas  involve the long bones of the lower extremity.  The femur as in this case is the single most frequently affected bone occurring in 30% of cases.  Distal involvement of the affected bone is three times more common than proximal involvement.  This case demonstrated more proximal involvement.  This osteochondroma affected the metaphysis which is common for these bone lesions.  Involvement of the diaphysis is rare.  Malignant transformation of osteochondromas occurs in approximately 1% of solitary lesions.  Transformation is most commonly due to chondrosarcoma arising in the cartilage cap of the lesion.  In rare cases, an osteosarcoma can develop at the base of the osteochondromaâ€™s stalk.  Lesions that grow or cause pain after skeletal maturity should be suspected of malignant transformation.  Malignant transformation before age 20 is unusual.  Suspect malignant transformation if the thickness of the cartilage cap of an osteochondroma measures more than 1.5 cm in a skeletally mature patient. Pain in the region of the osteochondroma may be a result of pressure of the osteochondroma on adjacent tissues with local inflammation or development of malignancy. Both are best evaluated by MRI.
