Acute bilateral (medial) thalamic infarction may be caused by thrombosis of the  Artery of Percheron.  Percheron described three arterial variants: bilateral medial branches of P1 with perforating vessels; a single or dominant unilateral P1 branch supplying both thalami with perforating vessels; and, an arching artery connecting the two P1s, with an arcade of perforating vessels.
