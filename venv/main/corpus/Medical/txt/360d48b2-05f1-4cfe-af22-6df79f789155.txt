Supernumerary nipple inferior to the right breast at the 5:30 position.
No further evaluation or treatment is necessary
The breast tissue is heterogeneously dense bilaterally, wich could abscure detection of small masses.  A few typically benign calcifications are seen bilaterally.

The craniocaudal view of the right breast demonstrates a small density in the posterior breast.  The anterior edge of the mass is well-defined while the posterior aspect of the mass is not clearly delineated.  The mediolateral oblique view of the right breast demonstrates the mass as a skin lesion in the inframammary fold.  These findings correspond to the supernumerary nipple present on physical examination.
