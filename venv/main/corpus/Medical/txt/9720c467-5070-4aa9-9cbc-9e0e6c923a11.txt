The patient was unable to bear weight without pain.  Ecchymosis and mild local swelling was present over lateral side of her left foot.  There was tenderness to palpation over the base of her fifth metatarsal.  She was neurovascularly intact distally, and there was no knee or hip tenderness.
Immobilization and non-weight bearing for 6 weeks.  Follow up radiographs to rule out non-union.  If non-union at 6 weeks, then internal fixation is required.
AP, lateral, and oblique radiographs of the left foot reveal a nondisplaced transverse fracture through the base of the fifth metatarsal. This fracture does not involve the joint.  There is normal anatomic alignment.  Hallux valgus is noted.  Joint spaces are preserved.   There is no evidence of soft tissue swelling.
Fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal (Jones Fracture)
1. Jones Fracture
2. Pseudo-Jones Fracture (avulsion fracture of peroneus brevis tendon insertion)
3. Accessory centers of ossification (sesamoid bones) - os vesalianum & os peroneum
73 year old woman stepped off a curb and inverted her left foot.  She felt a pop and experienced significant pain in her left lateral foot.  She is unable to bear weight without pain.
Fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal are the most common fractures of the mid-foot.  The Ottawa ankle rules help a provider raise or lower clinical suspicion of a fracture, thereby helping the clinician determine whether to obtain radiographs.  One of the rules  is to consider bone tenderness over the base of the fifth metatarsal, both because of the commonality and the possibility of long-term sequelae if not diagnosed early.  

There are two common fracture types; a Jones fracture, and Pseudo-Jones fracture.  A true Jones fracture is a transverse fracture 1.5 â€“ 3 cm distal to proximal tuberosity, usually with little displacement, and typically occurs with plantar flexion and lateral ankle strain.  Of the two types, it is less common but carries higher chance of non-union and long-term sequelae if not treated properly.  Continued weight bearing often leads to non-union (35-50%), which then requires internal fixation and possibly bone grafting.  The key to treatment is early recognition with immobilization and keeping the patient non-weight bearing.  

A Pseudo-Jones fracture occurs at the proximal tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal.  It is an avulsion fracture at the insertion of the peroneus brevis tendon and the lateral cord of the plantar aponeurosis to the base of the metatarsal.  This injury also occurs with plantar flexion and lateral ankle strain.  It differs from a true Jones fracture in that it is not a transverse fracture of the shaft, but rather an avulsion of the proximal tuberosity.  This type of fracture is more common than a true Jones fracture and carries better prognosis.  It usually heals well with a compression dressing and weight bearing as tolerated.  

Both of these fractures may mimic a fracture of the lateral malleolus on clinical exam due to swelling that extends up the peroneus brevis tendon sheath.  Therefore, it is important to always include the base of the fifth metatarsal on the lateral view when imaging the ankle.  

Accessory centers of ossification (sesamoid bones) may be mistaken for fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal, and should be considered when evaluating images.  There are two sesamoid bones that are normal variants in the area of the fifth metatarsal base.  The os vesalianum  may be seen just proximal to the base, and the os peroneum, which may be seen within the peroneus tendon just lateral to the cuboid bone.
