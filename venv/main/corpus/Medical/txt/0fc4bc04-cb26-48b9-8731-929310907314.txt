Sturge-Weber syndrome (encephalo-trigeminal angiomatosis)

12 year old boy with history of seizures.
Sturge Weber is a phakomatoses characterized by angiomas involving the leptomeninges and face. Classically the skin involvement involves a port wine stain in the V1/V2 distribution of the trigeminal nerve. The condition is caused by residual embryonic blood vessels that fail to resorb during development. The incidence is 1 in 50,000 with sporadic inheritance. Primary clinical findings may include seizures, developmental delay, and variable intellectual impairment.

Imaging findings include cortical calcifications and atrophy, abnormal draining veins, and enlarged choroid plexus. This patient also demonstrates buphthalmos with enlargement of the eye due to increased intraocular pressure from choroidal hemangiomas.
