Unknown, but a patient with this lesion might present with lower extremity edema.
CT with intravenous and oral contrast material demonstrates a large retroperitoneal mass with central dystrophic calcifications.  This mass is completely separate from the right kidney, which other than the hydronephrosis and the presence of the ureteral stent, is otherwise unremarkable.  The liver was also normal.

Superior images demonstrate a "beak sign" with the inferior vena cava and the left renal vein, strongly suggestive of the vascular origin of this tumor.

Note the presence of the ureteral stent, and the image demonstrating that the mass has extrinsic mass effect on the course of the ureter, causing the original clinical problem for which this patient was treated.
leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava
leiomyosarcoma
metastatic disease with tumor thrombus
angiosarcoma
high-grade liposarcoma
Patient is s/p placement of right ureteral stent for extrinsic obstruction of the right ureter due to a "mass" demonstrated on previous non-contrast renal stone protocol CT.
