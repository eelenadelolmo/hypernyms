Ulcerative colitis
35 y/o male who was 6 days status post removal of orthopaedic hardware presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain and diarrhea.  The patient was sent to radiology to rule out appendicitis.
This case is not specific for pseudomembranous colitis, lacking the pan colonic involvment and "toxic megacolon" appearance of dilatation often present.  The clinical senario of association with having received peri-surgical antibiotics guided diagnosis.
