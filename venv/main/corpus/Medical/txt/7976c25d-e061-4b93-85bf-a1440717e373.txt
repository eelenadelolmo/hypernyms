Solitary pulmonary nodule

-A single discrete pulmonary opacity that is surrounded by normal lung tissue and is not associated with adenopathy or atelectasis.

-Radiographically, a nodule is defined as a lesion smaller than 3 cm. Anything larger than 3 cm is termed a mass.

-SPNs are fairly common. Screening studies in adults reveal SPNs in 1-2 per 1000 chest radiographs. In the United States, an estimated 150,000 SPNs are detected annually.
