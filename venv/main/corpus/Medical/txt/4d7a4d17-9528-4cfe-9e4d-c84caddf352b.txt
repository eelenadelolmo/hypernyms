Pain along the medial tibia with tenderness to palpation.  Antalgic gait.
Patient was given exercise limitations and a walking boot.
Initial plain radiographs demonstrate linear, nonaggressive periosteal reaction along the tibial diaphysis.

Tc 99m MDP bone scan demonstrates a tubular focus of increased uptake along the distal tibial diaphysis on pool and delayed imaging.

CT demonstrates a vertically oriented fracture along the medial tibial diaphysis with eccentric periosteal reaction and endosteal callus.
Vertical stress fracture

38 year old African American male with history of pain with ambulation for 3 weeks.  

PMHx:  No chronic medical disease, history of malignancy or sickle cell disease.
Given the clinical history of a recent increase in activity and pain along the tibial diaphysis, the likelihood of a stress fracture was high.  The initial plain radiographs demonstrated periosteal reaction. Scintigraphic findings of a tubular focus of activity suggested a longitudinal stress fracture; however, given the pattern of uptake, the possibility of neoplasm was entertained.  Subsequent CT of the tibia, confirmed the diagnosis of a longitudinal stress fracture.
