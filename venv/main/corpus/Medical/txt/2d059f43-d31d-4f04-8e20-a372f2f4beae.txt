Medical treatment: NPO, broad spectrum antibiotics. Surgical resection of affected area of small bowel after perforation.
Most common finding: diffuse gaseous distention of the intestine (nonspecific).  Also seen is loss of symmetry of bowel gas distribution. In the NICU, pneumatosis intestinalis (intramural gas) is highly specific for NEC; this is seen most commonly in the distal small bowel and colon. The gas seen in pneumatosis intestinalis can extend into the intestinal vascular system and distally into the portal venous system. This is seen as fine, branching lucencies seen overlying the liver. If severe enough, pneumoperitoneum is a common sequela, seen as low density in the non-dependent portion of the patinet's abdomen.
