The RUQ US (Films .1 and .2) reveals a large gallstone casting an acoustic shadow.  The GB lumen is not well-identified.  There is an area of increased echogenicity posterior to the gallbladder suspicious for a mass.  The CT (Film .3) demonstrates dilated intrahepatic ducts, no dilated extrahepatic ducts, and a mass partially replacing the GB lumen and extending into the liver posteromedially.  Lower cuts show a round hypodensity in the GB (arrow) representing a large non-calcified gallstone.  Note the mass effect against the contrast-filled duodenum.  A PTC was done next to better define the extent of ductal involvement (Film .4).  The films show high grade obstruction of the CHD near the hilus with medial displacement of the duct by adjacent tumor mass.  The intrahepatic ducts are markedly dilated.  The findings of a mass partially filling the gallbladder lumen and extending into the liver with ductal obstruction at level of the porta hepatis and the presence of a gallstone are characteristic of gallbladder carcinoma.  This diagnosis was surgically confirmed.

Two additional cases of gallbladder carcinoma demonstrating characteristic findings on imaging studies are included.  A CT scan (Film .5) from a patient with tumor replacing the gallbladder lumen (HU #31) and locally invading the liver is shown.  Note the irregular margins, a large mass in the gallbladder fossa and the presence of calcified gallstones (arrow).  US (Films .6 and .7) and CT (Film .8) from the other case show thickening of the gallbladder wall with a polypoid intraluminal mass.  Extension into the adjacent liver and multiple small hepatic metastases are visible on the CT.
Gallbladder carcinoma.
A 69-year-old woman with RUQ pain, weight loss and jaundice, was admitted for evaluation.  She was examined with US and CT.  What are the findings?  What would you do next?
Carcinoma of the gallbladder is the fifth most common cause of death from GI malignancy.  Most cases occur after the age of 50.  Gallbladder carcinoma is three times more frequent in females.  There is a high association (65-95%) with gallstones.  The disease is almost always advanced at the time of detection; the early stages are asymptomatic.  It may be an incidental finding at cholecystectomy or on imaging studies.

Most lesions are well-differentiated adenocarcinoma.  Three primary morphologic patterns are seen (Film .9):  1) an intraluminal polypoid mass (15-25%),  2) focal or diffuse wall thickening (20-30%), and  3) a fungating mass replacing the gallbladder (40-65%) and extending to the adjacent liver. 

Direct spread to contiguous structures is the most frequent route of extension and involvement of the medial segment of the left lobe of the liver is most commonly seen.  Biliary obstruction is common.

The preoperative diagnosis was rarely made prior to ultrasound and CT; OCG showed non-visualization.  On US and CT, the most frequent findings are gallstones and a mass in the gallbladder fossa extending to the adjacent liver.  This appearance may be difficult to distinguish from cholecystitis complicated by abscess or perforation.  Dilated bile ducts from tumor involvement and obstruction of the CHD may also be seen.  Other findings seen on US or CT include gallbladder wall thickening, an intraluminal polypoid mass, nodal involvement or metastases.  When the mass is confined to the gallbladder, the sonographic appearance may be indistinguishable from gallstones or the presence of stones may obscure the lesion.

When biliary obstruction is present, direct cholangiography is helpful to outline the exact nature and site of obstruction.  This may be difficult to assess by CT or US.  On PTC, the common hepatic duct above the cystic in the area of the porta hepatis is most frequently affected.  The common duct may be displaced medially by the tumor mass.  If the lesion extends higher into the liver, multiple sites of obstruction can be present.  Because of cystic duct involvement, the gallbladder usually does not fill.  The differential diagnosis of the cholangiographic appearance includes obstruction from metastatic nodes in the porta hepatis and primary cholangiocarcinoma.
