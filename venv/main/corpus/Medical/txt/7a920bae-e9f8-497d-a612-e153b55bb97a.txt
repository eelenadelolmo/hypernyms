Right inferior quadrantanopsia on formal visual field testing
G6PD deficiency
This patient had an extensive workup.  Lyme titers were negative.  CSF did not show oligoclonal bands nor pleocytosis.
• Lateral geniculate body - abnormal signal and enhancement
• Additional periventricular lesions
Multiple Sclerosis, Quadrantanopsia
• Multiple sclerosis
• Lyme disease
• ADEM (Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis)
• Sarcoidosis
• Vasculitis (SLE, etc.)
42 y.o. combat fighter pilot c/o "blind spot" - sudden onset  six days ago and lasted about four hours.  Previous Hx of a similar episode several years ago.
Quadrantanopsia usually affects the optic radiations posterior (distal) to the lateral geniculate nucleus (body) - where the fibers from the superior retina diverge deep into the temporal lobe as Myer&#39;s loop.  The separation of the superior and inferior axons allows a lesion to produce a scotoma (field cut) affecting a quadrant.

The lateral geniculate body is supplied by the both the lateral posterior choroidal artery and the anterior Choroidal Artery (AChA); and, ischemia could produce a hemianopsia usually in association with hemiplegia and hemianesthesia.
