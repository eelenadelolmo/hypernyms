Vital signs stable, afebrile, HR 66, BP 142/93, respirations non-labored on room air; Abdomen soft/tender to palpation LLQ near prior surgical site and suprapubic tenderness; abdomen is non-distended with positive bowel sounds, rectal guaiac negative with external and internal hemorrhoids and slightly enlarged non-tender prostate, rectal exam causing moderate discomfort.

Laboratory values: WBC count 6.7, H&H 14.2/40.7, Plts 246, electrolytes WNL, urinalysis negative.  Protein/Albumen normal.  Liver and pancreatic enzymes normal.
Mesenteric panniculitis is a rare clinical entity which currently has no standardized treatment. Patients are generally treated with anti-inflammatory or immunosuppresive agents depending on severity of presentation. Because our patient had no signs of obstruction or advanced disease, this patient was treated with the anti-inflammatory agent Toradol which provided relief of his symptoms. Patient was continued on a PO anti-inflammatory regimen for home use and followed up in colorectal clinic to assess symptomatic relief.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis w/ IV and PO Contrast:   

Abdomen: Subtle focal stranding of the mesenteric fat ("misty mesentery") is noted (best seen in figure 1).  A suture line is seen in the area of sigmoid colon, likely secondary to previous colon resection and colostomy take down. The remaining large bowel demonstrates no gross abnormalities such as wall thickening or surrounding inflammatory changes to suggest an acute process. No free intraperitoneal air or obstruction. No free fluid is seen.  

Pelvis:  The urinary bladder is partially distended.  There is apparent lateral thickening which may be secondary to lack of distention. The prostate is within upper limits of normal in size. Seminal vesicles are symmetric.

44 y/o Hispanic man who presents with a complaint of 5 days of aching LLQ abdominal pain and dysuria. Onset was gradual after he experienced a bout of constipation subsequently followed by a large watery/liquidy bowel movement. 

His past medical history is significant for diverticulosis, sigmoid diverticulitis s/p emergent exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, and Hartmann's procedure 8 months previously and reversal colostomy and Hartmann's take down 2 months previously. His PMHx also includes HTN, stable angina (last episode in 2003), prostatitis. His past surgical history also includes appendectomy. His family history is negative for cancer and bowel problems, positive for HTN and DM. His social history is negative for tobacco and IVDU, with occasional social EtOH.
Mesenteric panniculitis is rare and can occur independently or in association with other diseases. Our patient presented similarly to some of the 130 cases previously described in the literature, having a history of diverticulosis/itis and abdominal surgery.
