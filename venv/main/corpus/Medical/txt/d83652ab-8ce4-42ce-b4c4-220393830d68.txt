Cardiac sarcomas are the most common primary malignant tumor of the heart and pericardium. They are rare neoplasms; metastatic disease to the heart is at least 30 times more common.  Angiosarcoma is the most common subtype.  Most cardiac angiosarcomas arise as mural masses in the right atrium and invade adjacent structures.  Treatment options are limited, with surgical resection being the best hope.
