Evidence of trigeminal and facial nerve dysfunction.
The patient is referred for Neurosurgery consultation.
Multiplanar and multisequence MR Imaging demonstrates the presence of an intradural multilobulated lesion located in the prepontine and interpeduncular cistern. The lesion is isointense on T1-weighted sequence and on T2-weighted sequence and hyperintense on FLAIR sequence compared to CSF signal intensity. The lesion is hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images (b-value:1000 sec/mm2). On apparent diffusion coeffficient (ADC) maps the lesion is hypointense to CSF, suggesting restricted diffusion within the substance of the lesion.
The findings are consistent with epidermoid cyst.
Intracranial epidermoid cyst (retroclival)
Differential diagnosis includes: arachnoid cyst, dermoid cyst, neurocysticercosis, cystic neoplasm.
63 y.o. man presents with a two week history of headache and facial numbness.
The incomplete nulling of the lesion on FLAIR sequence and the restricted diffusion on DWI supported the diagnosis of epidermoid cyst , ruling out arachnoid cyst Post contrast T1 weighted images were not obtained for unknown reasons. We would expect minimal enhancement of the lesion on post contrast images. High-resolution steady-state free precession (SSFP) images would delineate better the relationship of the epidermoid cyst with the cranial nerves of the prepontine and interpeduncular cisterns
