Frontal and lateral radiographs of the left elbow demonstrate normal alignment and joint spaces.  Negative for fracture.  At the intracondylar portion of the distal humeral metaphysis there is a non-aggressive sub-1 cm sclerotic focus within the medullary cavity.  There is no osseous expansion, periosteal reaction or associated soft tissue mass.  Multiplanar non-contrast CT images of the distal humerus show that the sclerotic focus has tiny spicules projecting outward to the surrounding medullary cavity.
