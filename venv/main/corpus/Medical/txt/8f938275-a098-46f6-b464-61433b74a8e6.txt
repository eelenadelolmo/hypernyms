Pain on weight bearing
Widening of the left femoral physis with posteromedial slippage of the proximal femoral epiphysis.
Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis
Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis
10 year old white female with left hip pain.
- Salter Harris I fracture through the femoral epiphysis
- Often occurs during growth spurts in overweight    adolescents (M>F 2.4:1)
- Bilateral 20-40%

Classifications:
Preslip: physis blurring with femoral neck demineralization
Acute Slip: Line of Klein fails to intersect the femoral head, smaller appearing epiphysis due to the slip
Chronic Slip: sclerosis at metaphysis

Loder Classification: stable vs. unstable based on weightbearing status

Complications include avascular necrosis (10-15%), chondrolysis, osteoarthritis, limb-length discrepancy
