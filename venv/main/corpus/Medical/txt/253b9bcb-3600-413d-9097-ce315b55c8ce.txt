Protein electrophoresis revealed a polyclonal gammopathy and bone marrow examination was suggestive of either a myeloproliferative or dysplastic syndrome. His mental status continued to deteriorate and he became unable to stand or walk without assistance.
The patient was given radiation therapy and showed mild improvement. However, he remained unable to move his lower extremities and died 9 months after the onset of his illness.
MRI showed multiple white matter lesions. One of the lesions was biopsied about 6 months after the onset of his illness.
Intravascular lymphomatosis (IVL)
This 52 year old man developed generalized malaise, low grade fever, subtle mental status changes, and generalized weakness over a three month period. He also developed mild anemia and enlargement of his spleen.
The imaging findings in IVL resemble other causes of small vessel disease, vasculitis, and cerebral infarction.
