Tachycardia, difficulty with word finding, ideomotor apraxia and confusion.
Transfusion with PBRCâ€™s, IVF, Aspirin 325 mg po qd, Carotid Doppler US, TTE, started heparin drip at 700 units/hr.  Repeat CT in 48 hrs to rule out hemorrhagic conversion as patient is starting heparin drip.  Speech therapy and swallow test to assure no possibility of aspiration.  MRA can be used to visualize the vasculature and determine if nature of infarct was thrombotic or embolic.
Noncontrast CT shows hypodensity in L parietal lobe with no visible compression of other structures.  No hyperdens or hemorrhagic areas are noted.

MRI DWI image shows hyperintense signal within same area demonstrating restricted diffusion of water molecules.
L parietal ischemic infarct
Ischemic infarction of L parietal lobe with no evidence of hemorrhagic nature.
