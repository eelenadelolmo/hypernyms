Patient in visible pain and moving her legs to distract herself.  Abdominal:  BS normal, no guarding, tenderness to palpation in the bilateral pelvic region worse on the right side.  Labs:  Neg HCG, CBC:  15.4>15.1/44.6<219
Patient received laparoscopic appendectomy that night.  The surgery was uncomplicated and a large inflamed appendix was removed.   No sign of perforation was present in the abdomen.  The patient was admitted to the hospital overnight and had an uneventful stay.  She still had mild surgical pain the morning but she returned home.   A few days later the pathology results returned confirming she had acute appendicitis.
The appendix does not demonstrate filling of contrast.  It measures between 8-9 mm in diameter.  There is no surrounding fluid and no evidence of abscess or significant inflammatory change.  There is no evidence of adnexal mass or inflammatory bowel disease.

):    Appendicitis can often be difficult to diagnose especially at ages less than three and greater than 60, leading to a possible delay in diagnosis in these groups and perforation rates up to 80%.   Furthermore, as the most common abdominal surgical emergency with an incidence of 233/100,000, physicians tend to approach potential cases aggressively.  This leads to a high number of appendectomies with normal appendices:  about 15% nationwide.  This negative appendectomy rate has unfortunately remained constant in the last fifteen years despite increased use of CT and ultrasound1.   CT has a fairly high sensitivity and specificity for appendicitis.  In the literature the exact sensitivity and specificity varies significantly:  84-100% and 83-98% respectively2,3.

On a oral/IV contrast CT, looking for acute appendicitis several findings can be expected.  Increased appendiceal diameter greater than 6 mm is usually seen in addition to circumferential and symmetric wall thickening.  Periappendiceal inflammation is usually seen in the form of linear fat stranding, local fascial thickening and subtle clouding of the mesentery.  The CT may also have focal cecal apical thickening and the “arrowhead sign” or cecal contrast that funnels symmetrically at the cecal apex.  If the appendix is perforated then pericecal phlegmon or an abscess may be present.  Extraluminal air, ileocecal thickening, localized lymphadenopathy and small bowel obstruction may also be seen4.
