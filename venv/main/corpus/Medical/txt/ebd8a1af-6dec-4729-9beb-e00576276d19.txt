Patient underwent bowel resection for ischemia, followed by surgery for abdominal compartment syndrome, and later died.
Numerous dilated tubular loops of bowel with no air in the rectum on plain films.  There is a normal rectosigmoid juction with abnormal mucosal irregularity present with enema.
Hirschsprung's enterocolitis
A differential for this patient include causes for distal obstruction in a neonate.  Some of these include:
•	Imperforate anus
•	Anal atresia
•	Intestinal atresia
•	Small left colon syndrome
•	Meconium plug syndrome
•	Meconium ilieus
•	Intestinal malrotation
5 day old male who presented with jaundice and decreased stooling.  Past medical History significant for scant stool at 43 hours of life.
With Hirschsprung’s disease, an enema showing a rectosigmoid ratio of less than 1 is diagnostic.  A normal ratio of greater than 1 does not rule out the presence of Hirschsprung’s disease, especially in neonates, as an enema is not 100% sensitive.  
    In this patient a physical exam ruled out the presence of causes such as imperforate anus and anal atresia.  The normal enema in this patient rules out most other diagnoses except for Hirschsprung’s disease.  The addition of mucosal irregularity with the addition of minimal stool for 5 days w/abdominal distention is concerning for Hirschsprung’s enterocolitis.  
    Hirschsprung’s enterocolitis is a necrotizing enterocolitis that can affect term neonates with Hirschsprung’s disease increasing the risk for a poor outcome as with this patient.
