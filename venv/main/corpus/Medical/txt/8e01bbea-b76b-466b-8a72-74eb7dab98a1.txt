High resistance waveforms and elevated renal index in interlobular, arcuate and intralobular arteries in the upper, mid and lower poles of the transplanted kidney.  Cortico-meduallary differentiation was preserved. No evidence of hydronephrosis. The renal arteries and veins were unobstructed.

The renal hilar fat is mildly decreased in echogenicity with vessels displaced around this region.  Follow up imaging was performed to exclude mass, such as post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.  Findings were found to be secondary to scar tissue without mass.
Renal Transplant decreased function secondary to rejection
Chronic rejection secondary to low immunosuppressant level vs cyclosporin toxicity.

Excluded were:

Renal artery stenosis - Acute renal failure secondary to ischemia.
Renal vein thrombosis
Hydronephrosis
69y/o male with history of multiple myeloma in remission since 1996 presents with faliure of transplanted kidney and sepsis from a multilobar pneumonia. Kidney transplant was performed in 1996, but patient stopped taking his Cyclosporine 1 week prior to presentation.
