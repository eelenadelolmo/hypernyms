Didelphys uterus, hydroneprosis of the left ectopic kidney
N/A
18 years old woman with abnormal menses
When both mullerian ducts develop but fail to fuse uterus didelphys results.
The female reproductive system develops from the paired m?llerian ducts, lateral to wolffian ducts. The close developmental relationship of the m?llerian and wolffian ducts explains the frequent association of anomalies of the female genital system and urinary tract, therefore the number and position of the kidneys should be evaluated in these patients.
The most cephalad parts of the mullerian  ducts remain separate and form the fallopian tubes. The lower parts of the ducts fuse while the midline septum disappears, leaving a single canal: the uterus and upper two-thirds of the vagina. 
A longitudinal or transverse vaginal septum may be associated with this anomaly
This anomaly belongs to class 3  of American Fertility Society classification modified by Rock and Adam
